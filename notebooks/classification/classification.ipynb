       "\"most liquids contract upon cooling and become more viscous with pressure .this is not the case for the most important liquid on earth , water . for at least 300 yearsit has been known that the specific volume of water at ambient pressure starts to increase when cooled below @xmath0c @xcite .it is perhaps less known that the viscosity of water decreases upon increasing pressure in a certain range of temperatures @xcite . moreover , in a certain range of pressures water exhibits an anomalous increase of compressibility , and hence of density fluctuations , upon cooling .these anomalies are not restricted to water but are also present in other liquids @xcite .    in order to investigate these anomalies ,we utilize computer simulation of a class of potentials called `` core softened '' potentials , first introduced by stell , hemmer , and their coworkers @xcite .we define a core - softened potential as a spherically symmetric potential that has a region of negative curvature in its repulsive core @xcite .an example of a discrete and of a smooth core - softened potential is shown in fig .[ figpots ] .debenedetti et al .noted that a `` softened core '' can lead to a density anomaly @xcite , i.e. , one of the anomalies found in water .furthermore , _ ab initio _ calculation @xcite and inversion of the experimental oxygen - oxygen radial distribution function reveals that a `` core - softened '' potential can be considered a realistic first - order approximation for the interaction between water molecules @xcite .although directional bonding is certainly a fundamental issue in obtaining quantitative predictions for network - forming liquids like water , it could be the case that core - softened potentials can be the simplest framework to understand the physics of those anomalies .here we demonstrate , by means of numerical simulations for @xmath1 , that the core - softened potential can lead to anomalies in the density , in the compressibility and in the viscosity .we also offer an explanation for the occurrence of these three anomalies in terms of the shape of the potential .the paper is organized as follows : in sec .[ secpot ] we define the potentials studied and in sec .  [ secmod ] we describe the methods of simulations employed . in sec .[ secden ] we present the results about the density anomaly . in sec .[ secstruc ] we discuss the relation of the structures in the solid phase and the density anomalies . in sec .[ secdif ] we present the results for the diffusion anomaly and give an explanation of such anomaly in terms of free volume . in sec .[ seckt ] we present the results on the compressibility anomaly . finally , we present the overall phase diagram in sec .[ secphas ] and our conclusions and comments in sec .[ secconc ] .the core - softened potentials that we study are shown in fig .[ uform ] as a function of particle pair distance @xmath2 .the discrete potential is composed of a hard core of diameter @xmath3 which has a repulsive shoulder of width @xmath4 at depth @xmath5 , and an attractive well of width @xmath6 and depth @xmath7 .the form of the function is thus    @xmath8    all of the results reported here for the discrete potential are for @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .    in the case of water, one can attribute the larger distance @xmath14 to hydrogen bonding , for which the system acquires a low energy and expands at the same time .the inner distance @xmath15 on the other hand corresponds to a non - hydrogen bonded energy state .recent studies have proposed this form of potential as the interaction between clusters of strongly bonded pentamers of water @xcite .this type of interaction is expected to reproduce the density anomaly .the reason is that at low pressures and at low temperatures , nearest neighbor pairs sit in the outer well which has a lower energy . by increasing @xmath16 , in order to gain more entropy , the system explores a larger portion of the configurational space , which is not probed at lower temperatures .this includes penetrating the `` soft '' core ( @xmath17 ) , which on average can lead to anomalous contraction upon heating .while the discrete potential @xmath18 is appropriate for deriving the closed form of equation of state in @xmath19 @xcite , for simulations it is not necessarily the most appropriate .as we will show in the next section , the smooth version of the potential @xmath20 requires a different method of simulation from that of @xmath18 .the potential @xmath20 we use is obtained by adding a gaussian well to the lennard - jones potential and has the form @xmath21-\\\\lambda'\\\\epsilon'\\\\exp\\\\left[-w^n\\\\left({r\\\\over\\\\sigma}-{r_0\\\\over \\\\sigma}\\\\right)^n\\\\right],\\\\ ] ] for @xmath22 and vanishes for @xmath23 .we use @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 in order to mimic the shape of the discrete potential , as shown in fig .[ figpots ] .the method of simulation in both the discrete and the smooth cases is the molecular dynamics ( md ) method .our simulations are performed in @xmath30 with periodic boundary conditions .the overall qualitative results of the simulations for the discrete and the smooth potential are similar , while the quantitative results differ . in what follows , we explain in more detail the md method used in each case .      for the discrete potential [ eq .

( [ uformcont ] ) ], we use the velocity verlet integrator method @xcite for a system of @xmath52 discs .we record the results in reduced units in which @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are all unity .we choose @xmath57 , and the length of each md time step @xmath58 .we assign to each particle a radius @xmath59 , which corresponds to the minimum of the lennard - jones potential @xmath53 , and define the density @xmath33 to be the ratio of the total area of all the disks to the area of the box .    in order to achieve a preset temperature we use the berendsen method of rescaling the velocities @xcite , resulting in the time dependence @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a preset time constant @xcite .typical values of @xmath61 are around @xmath62 .we first thermalize the system for a time @xmath63 , and we ensure that equilibrium is attained by monitoring the time dependence of observables like @xmath16 , @xmath64 and the potential energy @xmath65 .then we acquire data , running the system for an additional period of time at constant nve conditions ( micro - canonical ensemble ) .we calculate @xmath64 and @xmath16 and we consider the system to be in equilibrium only when the fluctuations of these quantities are less than @xmath66 of their average values . the acquisition time is chosen to be more than the time it takes for the system to equilibrate and is typically @xmath67 to @xmath68 .    the average simulation speed on boston university s sgi origin  2000 supercomputer was approximately @xmath69 per particle update .each of the state points we study requires between @xmath70 and @xmath71 hours on one processor , and thus over @xmath72 hours total computational time was utilized .in order to check that our results are not biased by problems like phase coexistence that can affect constant - volume simulations , we also perform constant - pressure simulations in the case of the smooth potential .constant - pressure simulations allow us to determine more accurately the locations of the freezing line and the density maximum .we use the feedback method proposed by broughton @xcite , where the dimensions of the box and the positions of the particles are rescaled to obtain the desired pressure @xmath64 .the amount of rescaling depends on the difference between the present pressure @xmath73 and the desired pressure @xmath64 .    using the broughton method and the berendsen method, we gradually drive the system to the desired @xmath64 and @xmath16 , while simulating under readjusting @xmath74 and @xmath75 conditions .we choose pressure and temperature tolerances @xmath76 and @xmath77 less than @xmath78 of the desired @xmath64 and @xmath16 .once @xmath73 and @xmath79 reach values within the range @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we stop thermalization and pressurization .if the system stays within these limits for an interval of time of the same order of time needed to reach the desired @xmath64 and @xmath16 , we conclude that the system has equilibrated , turn off the thermalization and pressurization , and start collecting data . during this collection period ,we monitor temperature and pressure to check that their average values coincide with the desired ones within an accuracy of @xmath78 . for our results ,the time @xmath82 needed to reach equilibrium is usually of the order of 500,000 steps @xmath41 , so @xmath83 in lennard - jones units .data are acquired over a period of @xmath84 .we test our code by simulating a lennard - jones system of @xmath85 disks and comparing the results with the previously - known phase diagram of a @xmath30 lennard - jones system .the temperature of density maximum ( @xmath86 ) line is the border of the region in the @xmath87 plane where the liquid expands upon cooling . fig .  [fig : isobars ] shows a set of different isobars for the smooth potential .the @xmath86 line corresponds to the set of maxima along those isobars .    in the case of constant - volume simulations, the @xmath86 line corresponds to the minima along constant - volume paths ( @xmath64 vs. @xmath16 graphs of fig .3 ) since for any thermodynamic quantity @xmath88 constant - volume paths @xmath89 by substituting @xmath90 we find @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the thermal expansion coefficient and @xmath93 is the isothermal compressibility .taking a derivative of eq .( [ eqsderivateives ] ) , using @xmath94 at the @xmath95 line , we find @xmath96    equations  ( [ eqminisoch ] ) and ( [ eqsecondderiv ] ) show that since @xmath97 is always positive and finite for systems in equilibrium not at a critical point , a minimum along the isochore is equivalent to a minimum along an isobar , which is the density maximum point @xmath86 .figure  [ fig : isochores ] shows the isochores for the smooth and the discrete potentials .    to confirm that we are investigating the liquid state part of the phase diagram, we introduce a criterion to distinguish the liquid state from a frozen state .we determine the freezing line as the location of points where isochores overlap . in this way we establish an approximate location for the freezing line . crossing this line from the liquid side ,we find a sharp decrease in @xmath98 coinciding with the appearance of slowly - decaying peaks in @xmath99 as a function of @xmath2 , which signals the build up of long - range correlations ( fig .[ fig : gidierre ] ) , which is a characteristic of 2d solids .we confirm the above criterion adopted to locate the freezing lines by using isobaric simulations for the smooth potential . indeed , they show a sharp change of density , in correspondence with the estimated freezing line at high pressures  ( fig .  [fig : rhojump ] , lower panel ) .the presence of a hysteresis loop  ( fig .[ fig : presloop ] ) suggests that the liquid - solid transition is first - order ; however , by lowering the pressure the loops become less and less pronounced and eventually disappear , leaving the possibility of an hexatic second - order transition @xcite .    for a few state points near the freezing line, we have checked our results by simulating @xmath52 particles in rectangular boxes with aspect ratio @xmath100 @xmath101 , with @xmath102 ) which accommodate triangular lattices perfectly .this eliminates any possible artificial hindrance in crystallization that may arise from the asymmetry imposed by the shape of the square box .    for water ,the locus of the @xmath86 line in the p - t phase diagram is of special interest to distinguish between different scenarios proposed to explain its anomalies @xcite . in fig .[ phdiag ] we see that the @xmath86 line changes from negative slope at high pressures to positive slope at low pressures .this change in slope is similar to what is observed in simulating model potentials of water like spc / e or st2 @xcite .these results suggest that the change in slope can be a general phenomenon stemming from the general core - softened form of the interaction in the simulation .figure  [ fig : rhojump ] ( upper panel ) shows the different phases of the system . in our simulationswe see that the @xmath86 line is located in the region of pressures where the freezing line is negatively sloped , as in water . a density anomaly and a negatively - sloped melting lineare often associated @xcite .this has proven to be the case for substances like water ( fig .[ waterdiff ] ) and tellurium @xcite and for computer models @xcite .this association is plausible since the isobaric thermal expansion coefficient @xmath103 is related to the cross fluctuations in volume and entropy as @xmath104    approaching a freezing line , we expect local density fluctuations to have structures similar to the neighboring solid as they are going to trigger the liquid - solid transition . on the other hand, the clausius - clapeyron relation for the slope of the freezing line @xmath105 implies that , if the freezing line is negatively sloped , the solid , which has a lower entropy than the liquid , will have a higher specific volume .therefore , if the fluctuations in the liquid are `` solid - like , '' @xmath103 [ eq .  ( [ crossalpha ] ) ] will turn out to be negative .    to distinguish different local structures in the liquid , we plot the radial distribution function @xmath99 for different pressures and temperatures ( fig .  [fig : gidierre ] ) . as expected , at low pressures cooling expels particles from the core , while increasing pressure at fixed temperature has the opposite effect .since our system is two - dimensional , we can use visual inspection to develop an intuitive picture of the possible local structures ( fig .[ fig : rhojump ] , upper panel ) . if the fluctuations in the liquid are `` solid - like , '' near the freezing line we expect to see local structures that resemble the structure of the nearby solid .we find that at low @xmath64 and @xmath16 , the system is frozen with a hexagonal structure ( fig .[ seelocalstruct ] , lower left panel ) . a `` snapshot '' of the system along the same isobaric line ( fig .[ seelocalstruct ] , lower right panel ) shows clearly that local patches with hexagonal order are present in the liquid phase near the freezing line .we will refer to this structure as the `` open structure . '' similarly , at high pressures the local patches in the liquid phase near the freezing line ( fig .[ seelocalstruct ] , upper right panel ) resemble the structure of the system when it is frozen at low @xmath16 and high @xmath64 ( fig .[ seelocalstruct ] , upper left panel ) .we will refer to this as the `` dense structure . '' for the open structures , each particle has six neighbors sitting in the deepest well , and the softened - core behaves as the effective core for the particles . the dense structure is the next energetically favorable local arrangement , with four neighbors in the external well and four in the softened core , for which the effective core is the hard core .we next study the diffusion anomaly , which is another surprising feature of water .while for most materials diffusivity decreases with pressure , liquid water has an opposite behavior in a large region of the phase diagram @xcite ( fig .[ waterdiff ] ) .the pressures where the system has a maximum diffusivity along isotherms define the line of the pressure of maximum diffusivity , @xmath106 .we observe that our core - softened potential reproduces this anomaly .we first measure the mean square displacement @xmath107 ^ 2\\\\rangle$ ] and then the diffusion coefficient using the relation @xmath108 we measure @xmath109 by averaging over the starting time @xmath110 in eq .( [ deinst ] ) .we find that there is a region of the phase diagram in which @xmath98 increases upon increasing @xmath64  ( fig  [ 2ddiffs ] ) .    in order to understand the diffusion anomaly we first note that , for normal liquids , @xmath98 decreases with @xmath64 because upon increasing @xmath64 the density increases and moleculesare more constrained . as a result the viscosity increases and hence @xmath98 decreases . in the case of waterthe anomaly can be related to the fact that increasing pressure ( and hence density ) breaks hydrogen bonds , which in turn increases the mobility of the molecules .we present a more general explanation which can equally apply to our radially symmetric core - softened interaction which does not possess any directional bonds similar to hydrogen bonds .the low energy inter - particle state at @xmath111 plays the role of non - directional bond .note that @xmath98 is proportional to the mean free path of particles , which increases with the free volume per particle @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the excluded volume per particle resulting from the effective hard core . at low temperatures ,@xmath114 for the dense structure is proportional to the area @xmath115 of the hard core , while for the open structure it is proportional to the area @xmath116 of the soft core . increasing @xmath64 decreases @xmath117 , which is the main effect in normal liquids .for the core - softened liquid , on the other hand , increasing @xmath64 can also decrease @xmath114 by transforming some of local open structures to dense structures . since both @xmath118 and @xmath119 decrease with @xmath64 and since @xmath120 , the effect of @xmath64 on @xmath98 depends on whether @xmath118 or @xmath119 dominates . the anomalous increase in @xmath98 along the isotherms nearthe freezing line is a sign of the dominance of the @xmath119 term .thus the anomaly in @xmath98 must disappear near a certain pressure above which the average distance between particles corresponds to the dense structure , and as a result the contribution of the open structure to @xmath114 is negligible .we verified this in our simulation by observing a correspondence between the disappearance of the diffusion anomaly and the disappearance of the peak in @xmath99 , corresponding to the open structure that is observed in real water .in order to investigate the anomaly in isothermal compressibility @xmath97 , we calculate @xmath97 at each state point using the data in fig .  3 .in the smooth potential case we verify these results using @xmath121 as an alternative method @xcite , where @xmath122 is the density of the system and @xmath123 is the structure function and is related to the pair correlation function via @xmath124 .we first calculate @xmath99 for each state point averaging over all thermalized configurations .we then perform numerical integration using eq .( [ sqg ] ) to find @xmath123 , and finally we extrapolate @xmath123 to @xmath125 and substitute in eq .( [ ktsq ] ) to find @xmath97 .we show an example of the graphs for @xmath99 and the resulting @xmath123 ( normalized by the extra factors in eq .[ ktsq ] ) in fig .[ fig : gr - and - sq ] .we fit the low @xmath126 tail of the curve to a line to find the limiting value in eq .( [ ktsq ] ) .we graph @xmath97 along isobars , as shown in fig .[ 2dktsmooth ] . for large @xmath16 ,the @xmath97 decreases upon increasing @xmath64 . for small @xmath16the behavior is the opposite and the compressibility anomaly occurs . as seen for all isobars shown in fig .[ 2dktsmooth ] ( except a low pressure one ) , @xmath97 increases by lowering @xmath16 .in water the @xmath86 line is negatively sloped for positive pressures . for several models that mimic water behavior, it is found that the @xmath86 line has a reentrant shape , changing slope at low or negative pressures @xcite . in our simulations, we find such a reentrant @xmath86 line ; the change of slope of the @xmath86 happens at positive pressures in the smooth version and at negative pressures in the discrete case ( fig .[ phdiag ] ) .moreover , we have graphed the location of the minimum @xmath97 point along each isobar ; the locus of these points is called the minimum compressibility line ( @xmath127 ) .sastry and coworkers @xcite , from basic thermodynamic arguments , show that : ( i ) the @xmath127 line intersects the @xmath86 line at its infinite slope point , and ( ii ) the compressibility must increase upon cooling in the region to the left of a negatively sloped @xmath86 line .our results are in agreement with both of these statements  ( fig .[ phdiag ] ) .theories relating @xmath98 to the entropy @xcite predict that the anomalous behavior @xmath128 is related to an anomaly in the entropy  @xmath129 . due to the maxwell relation @xmath130 , whenever there is a density anomaly , an entropy anomaly occurs , and the value of entropy along isotherms reaches a maximum at the @xmath131 line .    in fig .[ phdiag ] we also show the @xmath106 line where @xmath98 reaches its maximum with pressure . notice that , for the continuous potential , the maximum in @xmath98 shifts to higher @xmath64 with increasing @xmath16 .this trend is also observed in the @xmath132 model of water @xcite but is in contrast with the behavior of real water  ( fig .  [ waterdiff ] ) .we find that core - softened potentials reproduce the qualitative behavior of water in many respects ; in particular , the liquid phase of core - softened potentials can show both thermodynamic anomalies and dynamic anomalies .moreover , as in real water , the freezing line changes slope from a positive value at high pressures to a negative value at low pressures in the p - t phase diagram and more than one solid phase is present .the polymorphism of the solid phase and the anomalies in the liquid phase can be related to the possibility of different local structures due to the shape of the potential .the phase diagrams of the discrete and the smooth versions of the core softened potential are similar to that of real water , but the @xmath86 line is shifted into liquid phase and the @xmath133 line has a positive slope .however , only for the discrete potential we find a @xmath106 line with a negative slope .we thank d.  wolf , r.  speedy , f.  sciortino , m.  canpolat , f.  w.  starr , e.  la  nave , m.  meyer , a.  skibinsky and g.  stell for enlightening discussions , and nsf for support .waller , r. , trans .essayes of natural experiments [ original in italian by the secretary of the academie del cimento ] .facsimile of 1684 english translation ( johnson reprint corporation , new york , 1964 ) .f. x. prielmeier , e. w. lang , r. j. speedy , and h .- d .ldemann , phys .lett . * 59 * , 1128 ( 1987 ) ; ber . bunsenges .phys . chem . *92 * , 1111 ( 1988 ) ; l. haar , j. s. gallagher , g. s. kell , _ nbs / nrc steam tables .thermodynamic and transport properties and computer programs for vapor and liquid states of water in si units _ ( hemisphere publishing co. , washington dc , 1984 ) , pp .\""

       "\"collective excitations of superfluid helium confined in various porous media have been studied by neutron scattering since early 90 s , and by now a wealth of information about helium in aerogel , vycor and geltech has been collected @xcite-@xcite .aerogel is an open gel structure formed by silica strands ( sio@xmath0 ) .typical pore sizes range from few   to few hundred   , without any characteristic pore size .vycor is a porous glass , where pores form channels of about 70    diameter .geltech resembles aerogel , except that the nominal pore size is 25    @xcite .liquid @xmath1he is adsorbed in these matrices in the form of atomic layers , the first layer is expected to be solid ; on a more strongly binding substrate , such as graphite , one expects two solid layers .energies and lifetimes of phonon  roton excitations for confined @xmath1he are nearly equal to their bulk superfluid @xmath1he values @xcite , but differences appear at partial fillings .the appearance of ripplons is tied to the existence of a free liquid surface ; neutron scattering experiments show clearly their presence in adsorbed films @xcite with few layers of helium .an exclusive feature of adsorbed films is the appearance of `` layer modes '' .the existence of such excitations has been proposed in the seventies @xcite from theoretical calculations of the excitations of two  dimensional 4 and comparison with specific heat data .direct experimental evidence for the existence of collective excitations below the roton minimum has first been presented by lauter and collaborators @xcite , identification of these excitations with longitudinally polarized phonons that propagate in the liquid layer adjacent to the substrate has been provided by microscopic calculations of the excitations of films @xcite .    in an experimental situation , the topology gives rise to non  uniform filling of the pores .but from the theoretical point of view different materials are characterized solely by their substrate potentials , because as long as the wavelength of the excitation in concern is much shorter than any porosity length - scale , the topology of the confining matrix is immaterial .we therefore examine the energetics of the layer  roton as a function of the substrate  potential strength which determines , in turn , the areal density in the first liquid layer . for that purpose ,we have carried out a number of calculations of the structure of helium films as a function of potential strength . the microscopic theory behind these calculationsis described in ref .our model assumes the usual 3 - 9 potential @xmath2{1\\\\over z^9 } - { c_3\\\\over z^3}\\\\ , ; \\\\label{eq : usub}\\\\ ] ] we have varied the potential strength @xmath3 from 8  k to 50  k and the range @xmath4 from 1000  k  @xmath5 to 2500  k@xmath5 . in all cases , we have considered rather thick films of an areal density of 0.45  @xmath6 .[ fig : profiles ] shows density profiles for these potential strengths close to the substrate ; the density profiles are practically independent of the potential range @xmath4 .     of the substrate potential .the substrate is at @xmath7 ., scaledwidth=48.0% ]to introduce excitations to the system one applies a small , time dependent perturbation that momentarily drives the quantum liquid out of its ground state . generalizing the feynman cohen wave function @xcite , we write the excited state in the form @xmath8^{1/2}}\\\\,,\\\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the exact or an optimized variational ground state , and the excitation operator is @xmath10 the time dependent excitation functions @xmath11 are determined by an action principle @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the weak external potential driving the excitations .the truncation of the sequence of fluctuating correlations @xmath14 in eq .( [ eq : deltau ] ) defines the level of approximation in which we treat the excitations .one recovers the feynman theory of excitations @xcite for non  uniform systems @xcite by setting @xmath15 for @xmath16 .the two  body term @xmath17 describes the time  dependence of the short  ranged correlations .it is plausible that this term is relevant when the wavelength of an excitation becomes comparable to the interparticle distance .consequently , the excitation spectrum can be quite well understood @xcite by retaining only the time dependent one and two  body terms in the excitation operator ( [ eq : deltau ] ) .the simplest non  trivial implementation of the theory leads to a density  density response function of the form @xcite@xmath18          \\\\phi^{(t)}({\\\\bf r}')\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho({\\\\bf r}')}\\\\nonumber \\\\label{eq : cbfresponse}\\\\end{aligned}\\\\ ] ] where the @xmath19 are feynman excitation functions , and @xmath20\\\\delta_{st } + \\\\sigma_{st}(\\\\omega)\\\\right]^{-1 } \\\\label{eq : gdef}\\\\ ] ] the phonon propagator .the fluctuating pair correlations give rise to the dynamic self energy correction @xcite , @xmath21 here , the summation is over the feynman states @xmath22 ; they form a partly discrete , partly continuous set due to the inhomogeneity of the liquid . the expression for the three  phonon coupling amplitudes @xmath23 can be found in ref .  .this self energy renormalizes the feynman `` phonon '' energies @xmath24 , and adds a finite lifetime to states that can decay .the form of the self energy given in eq .( [ eq : selfen ] ) is the generalization of the correlated basis functions ( cbf )  @xcite theory to inhomogeneous systems . as a final refinement of the theory , we scale the feynman energies @xmath25 appearing in the energy denominator of the self energy given in eq .( [ eq : selfen ] ) such that the roton minimum of the spectrum used in the energy denominator of eq .( [ eq : selfen ] ) agrees roughly with the roton minimum predicted by the calculated @xmath26 .this is a computationally simple way of adding the self energy correction to the excitation energies in the denominator of eq .( [ eq : selfen ] ) .we shall use this approximation for the numerical parts of this paper .layer phonons are identified by a transition density that is localized in the first liquid layer of the system .they appear in the dynamic structure function @xmath27 as a peak below the roton minimum .a grayscale map of a typical dynamic structure function is shown in fig .[ fig : skwplot ] , we have for clarity chosen a momentum transfer parallel to the substrate ; neutron scattering at other angles would broaden the roton minima @xcite .the figure shows in fact one bulk and two layer  roton minima , but the higher one , which corresponds to an excitation propagating in the second liquid layer , has an energy too close to the bulk roton to be experimentally distinguishable .the transition densities corresponding to the three pronounced excitations at @xmath28@xmath29 are depicted in fig .[ fig : trans ] .clearly , the two `` layer  modes '' are actually located in the two first layers adjacent to the substrate whereas the `` bulk '' mode is spread throughout the system .however , the figure also shows that the notion that the wave propagates in the first or the second layer is also not quite accurate : the lowest mode also has some overlap with the second layer , but especially the second mode spreads over both layers .     for a 4 film for the potential strength @xmath30k . the two layer rotons , the bulk roton , and the ripplon are indicated by arrows.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    we have carried out two independent calculations of the two  dimensional roton excitation : first , we calculated the roton energy as a function of the density for a rigorously two dimensional liquid. we can assess the accuracy of our predictions with the shadow  wave  function calculation of @xmath27 of ref ., who obtained a roton energy of @xmath31k at the equilibrium density of @xmath32@xmath6 .second , we have calculated the dynamic structure function @xmath33 in the relevant momentum region for the above family of substrate potentials .the results are compiled in fig .[ fig : rotonenergy ] where we also collect several experimental values .    .also shown is the energy of a two  dimensional roton obtained with shadow wave functions @xcite at the density of 0.0421@xmath6 .the short  dashed horizontal lines show experimental values of the roton energy on aerogel @xcite ( 7.39 and 7.14  k ) , vycor@xcite ( 7.23 k ) , and geltech@xcite ( 6.71 k ) , their energies are marked on the right margin.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    although exactly the same method has been used for the computation of the purely two - dimensional system and for the films , the results are quite different .we have obtained for the film calculation an effective layer density by integrating the three - dimensional densities shown in fig .[ fig : profiles ] to the first minimum .this is evidently not very well defined for the weakly bound systems , but it is not legitimate either for the case of strong binding where the first layer is well defined .in fact , the integrated density for the strongest substrate is 0.08  @xmath6 , which is well beyond the solidification density of the purely two  dimensional system .evidently , the zero  point motion in @xmath34 direction can effectively suppress the phase transition .we make therefore three conclusions : ( i ) the position of the layer roton minimum is indeed a sensitive measure for the strength of the substrate potential , ( ii ) purely two  dimensional models are manifestly inadequate for their understanding , and , hence , ( iii ) purely two  dimensional models are also questionable for interpreting thermodynamic data of adsorbed films .with one exception @xcite , the bulk roton energy in porous media have been reported to be practically identical to that in the bulk liquid , ref . reports a slight increase of the roton energy in aerogel at partial filling .a roton energy above the one of the bulk liquid can be explained by assuming that the density of the helium liquid in the medium is below that of the bulk liquid .this can , in turn , be qualitatively explained by the cost in energy to form a surface .    to be quantitative ,we have performed calculations of the energetics and structure of 4 in a gap between attractive silica walls @xcite and obtained the energy of the bulk roton ( c.f .[ fig : skwplot ] ) as a function of filling . fig .[ fig:3d - roton ] shows , as a typical example , the roton energetics in in a gap of 25    width .the independent parameter is the areal density @xmath35 , the corresponding three dimensional density was obtained by averaging the density profile over the full volume .it is seen that the equilibrium density is well below the bulk value . in other words ,the roton energy in a confined liquid should correspond to the one of a liquid that would , without confinement , have a negative pressure .the energy increase of the roton minimum found in this model is about 0.5 k , which is consistent with the experiments of ref . .to verify this interpretation of the data , it would be very useful to have comparable measurements for porous media with a more uniform distribution of pore sizes .in particular , comparably small pores should allow to densities that are even below the bulk spinodal density @xcite , thus facilitating experiments on 4 in density areas that were up to now inaccessible .\""

    "2.3 Basics about the Semantic Web\n",
    "The Internet, or World Wide Web (WWW), as it is known today was founded in 1989 by Tim\n",
    "Berners-Lee as a project at the European Organization for Nuclear Research facility, also\n",
    "known as CERN. Berners-Lee’s goal was to create a “wide-area hypermedia information\n",
    "retrieval initiative aiming to give universal access to a large universe of documents.” (cf.\n",
    "2.3 Basics about the Semantic Web 5\n",
    "Frysyk, 1994). The basic WWW is about connecting documents that contain data in the\n",
    "form of text or pictures. But already in 2001 Tim Berners-Lee talked about the next big step,\n",
    "namely the “Semantic Web”, which is more about connecting the data itself than connecting\n",
    "documents. Due to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an organization founded by\n",
    "Tim Berners-Lee to create standardized web formats, the Semantic Web is about two things:\n",
    "(cf. W3C et al., 2013)\n",
    "1. Common formats for data integration and combination from diverse sources.\n",
    "2. Recording how data relates to real world objects.\n",
    "Metadata is the key in the mentioned idea of the Semantic Web. “Metadata is ’data about\n",
    "data’.” (Riley, 2017, p. 1). It provides more information about the actual data, allowing us\n",
    "to derive knowledge out of it. It is not only used to describe the appearance of the data, but\n",
    "also to describe and denote its meaning and relation to other data. For Example: A weather\n",
    "station stores data about temperature, air moisture and wind strength; but it stores not only\n",
    "the raw values, but also timestamps and coordinates. This is metadata and it can be found\n",
    "everywhere (Riley, 2017, p. 1). Using this additional metadata, the weather stations can\n",
    "create statistics for specific time periods or locations, which they can use to trace diverse\n",
    "weather developments. Other Systems, when they can rely on metadata, are able to understand words and phrases that are equivalent. (Davies et al., 2007, 3) A common example:\n",
    "When searching Google for „Jaguar“ in the context of motor industry, the Google Search\n",
    "Engine „knows“ the user is not searching for the animal because in this context the semantic\n",
    "relations to the animal are very poor (Davies et al., 2007, 3). There are different types of\n",
    "metadata that should give a good overview and understanding of what metadata really is and\n",
    "why it can be found basically everywhere (cf. Riley, 2017, 6):\n",
    "• Descriptive metadata: Understand what the data is about or what the data means.\n",
    "• Administrative metadata:\n",
    "– Technical metadata: How to decode the data or how data has to be processed.\n",
    "– Preservation metadata: How to store files for a longer time.\n",
    "– Metadata about rights: Additional information about the intellectual property\n",
    "rights.\n",
    "• Structural Metadata: Relationships between data.\n",
    "• Markup languages: Integration of metadata for additional structural or semantic features (e.g. XML).\n",
    "This already shows that metadata is the first step to ensure high quality data. It provides\n",

    "to facilitate the development of the Semantic Web and Semantic Web applications. In addition, those standardization simplifies the compatibility of different applications. The most\n",

    "graphs consist of nodes and directed edges between those nodes. Those edges connect several nodes with specific properties. Imagine a relational database in form of a table (cf.\n",

    "The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard model for data interchange in\n",

    "be visualized using directed graphs (cf. Figure 2.5) (cf. Blumauer and Nagy, 2020, p. 96ff.).\n",

    "3. blank nodes\n",
    "Figure 2.5: RDF triple consisting of a subject, a predicate and an object. (Created with\n",

    "URIs are “Unique Resource Identifiers” that are used to clearly identify a thing or object\n",
    "in the real world. A URI points to a namespace or vocabulary in which the subject, predicate\n",
    "or object of the data is unambiguously defined. For example the predicate “hasTitle”: Does\n",
    "it mean the title of a book or the jobtitle in a company?. Namespaces/Vocabularies were\n",
    "created to avoid those complications and to differ between words with multiple possible\n",
    "meanings. IRIs are basically URIs with a wider range of possible characters (e.g Chinese\n",
    "symbols) that can be used to address an ontology. This is what a typical URI looks like:\n",
    "\"http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\". Its structure is very similar to URLs used to address documents\n",

    "Gayo et al., 2018, Chapter 7.1: ’Common Features’ & Chapter 7.2: ’Syntactic Differences’),\n",
    "they differ in their foundation and their way of how they work. While SHACL works with\n",
    "constraints to validate RDF graphs by checking if the constraints are satisfied, ShEx can\n",
    "rather be understood as a grammatic schema, that describes a RDF graph. This means that\n",
    "the validation results of ShEx look different than SHACL’s results. It shows which nodes\n",
    "3.2 Astrea-Tool: Generation of Shapes 19\n",
    "and shapes were matched (in form of an annotaded graph), instead of clearly depicting which\n",

    "those variables. DQTPs can be used to compare the values of multiple properties. (cf.\n",
    "Listing A.13)\n",
    "• Test Pattern Bindings are valid instances of a DQTP. They are triples consisting of a\n",

    "• Data Quality Test Cases are formed when the mappings of the pattern binding are\n",

    "returns results. Results can be: Success (empty result), violation (results are returned)\n",
    "or a timeout (test is marked for further inspection). (cf. Listing A.14)\n",

    "than other test cases). Integrated in RDFUnit is a pattern library that enables reusing test\n",
    "cases when vocabularies/namespaces are detected that were already used before. The pattern\n",
    "library of RDFUnit contains 17 DQTPs that can be applied to the shapes that appear most\n",
    "often in SHACL or OWL. Table A.3 contains every pattern together with a description and\n",

    "The Inspection Report, created after RDFUnit is finished, provides information about\n",
    "the generated test cases: How many cases passed, how many cases failed or timed out and\n",
    "how many errors occurred in general. This inspection report clearly depicts the quality of\n",
    "the tested datasets. Less errors imply a better dataset. Or at least a dataset that fits the given\n",

    "our activities are truly solitary and scarce are the times when we are\n",
    "really alone. Thus the study of how we are able to interact with one\n",
    "another, and what happens when we do, would seem to be one of the\n",
    "most fundamental concerns of anyone interested in human life. Yet\n",
    "strangely enough, it was not until relatively recently – from about the\n",
    "beginning of the nineteenth century onwards – that a specialist interest in this intrinsically social aspect of human existence was treated\n",
    "with any seriousness. Before that time, and even since, other kinds\n",
    "of interests have dominated the analysis of human life. Two of the\n",
    "most resilient, non-social approaches to human behaviour have been\n",
    "‘naturalistic’ and ‘individualistic’ explanations.\n",
    "Rather than seeing social behaviour as the product of interaction,\n",
    "these theories have concentrated on the presumed qualities inherent\n",
    "in individuals. On the one hand, naturalistic explanations suppose\n",
    "that all human behaviour – social interaction included – is a product\n",
    "of the inherited dispositions we possess as animals. We are, like animals,\n",
    "biologically programmed by nature. On the other hand, individualistic\n",
    "explanations baulk at such grand generalizations about the inevitability of behaviour. From this point of view we are all ‘individual’ and\n",
    "‘different’. Explanations of human behaviour must therefore always\n",
    "rest ultimately on the particular and unique psychological qualities\n",
    "of individuals. Sociological theories are in direct contrast to these\n",
    "2 An Introduction to Sociological Theories\n",
    "‘non-social’ approaches. Looking a little closer at them, and discovering\n",
    "what is wrong or incomplete about them, makes it easier to understand\n",
    "why sociological theories exist.\n",
    "Naturalistic theories\n",
    "Naturalistic explanations of human activity are common enough. For\n",
    "example, in our society it is often argued that it is only natural for\n",
    "a man and a woman to fall in love, get married and have children.\n",
    "It is equally natural for this nuclear family to live as a unit on their\n",
    "own, with the husband going out to work to earn resources for his\n",
    "dependants, while his wife, at least for the early years of her children’s\n",
    "lives, devotes herself to looking after them – to being a mother. As\n",
    "they grow up and acquire more independence, it is still only ‘natural’\n",
    "for the children to live at home with their parents, who are responsible for them, at least until their late teens. By then it is only natural\n",
    "for them to want to ‘leave the nest’, to start to ‘make their own way in\n",
    "the world’ and, in particular, to look for marriage partners. Thus\n",
    "they, too, can start families of their own.\n",
    "The corollary of these ‘natural’ practices is that it is somehow unnatural not to want to get married, or to marry for reasons other than\n",
    "love. It is equally unnatural for a couple not to want to have children,\n",
    "or for wives not to want to be mothers, or for mothers not to want to\n",
    "devote the whole of their lives to child-rearing. Though it is not right\n",
    "or natural for children to leave home much younger than eighteen,\n",
    "it is certainly not natural for them not to want to leave home at all\n",
    "in order to start a family of their own. However, these ‘unnatural’\n",
    "desires and practices are common enough in our society. There are\n",
    "plenty of people who prefer to stay single, or ‘marry with an eye on\n",
    "the main chance’. There are plenty of women who do not like the idea\n",
    "of motherhood, and there is certainly any number of women who do\n",
    "not want to spend their lives solely being wives and mothers. There\n",
    "are plenty of children who want to leave home long before they are\n",
    "eighteen while there are many who are quite happy to stay as members of their parents’ households until long after that age.\n",
    "Why is this? If human behaviour is, in fact, the product of a disposition inherent in the nature of the human being then why are such\n",
    "deviations from what is ‘natural’ so common? We can hardly put\n",
    "down the widespread existence of such ‘unnatural’ patterns of behaviour to some kind of large-scale, faulty genetic programming.\n",
    "In any case, why are there so many variations from these notions\n",
    "of ‘normal’ family practices in other kinds of human societies? Both\n",
    "An Introduction to Sociological Theories 3\n",
    "history and anthropology provide us with stark contrasts in family life.\n",
    "In his book on family life in Medieval Europe, Centuries of Childhood\n",
    "(1973), Philippe Ariès paints a picture of marriage, the family and\n",
    "child-rearing which sharply contradicts our notions of normality. Families were not then, as they are for us today, private and isolated units,\n",
    "cut off socially, and physically separated from the world at large.\n",
    "Families were deeply embedded in the community, with people living\n",
    "essentially public, rather than private, lives. They lived in households\n",
    "whose composition was constantly shifting: relatives, friends, children,\n",
    "visitors, passers-by and animals all slept under the same roof. Marriage\n",
    "was primarily a means of forging alliances rather than simply the\n",
    "outcome of ‘love’, while women certainly did not look upon mothering\n",
    "as their sole destiny. Indeed, child-rearing was a far less demanding\n",
    "and onerous task than it is in our world. Children were not cosseted\n",
    "and coddled to anywhere near the extent we consider ‘right’. Many\n",
    "more people – both other relatives and the community at large – were\n",
    "involved in child-rearing, and childhood lasted a far shorter time than\n",
    "it does today. As Ariès (1973) puts it, ‘as soon as he had been weaned,\n",
    "or soon after, the child became the natural companion of the adult’.\n",
    "In contemporary non-industrial societies, too, there is a wide range\n",
    "of variations in family practices. Here again, marriage is essentially a\n",
    "means of establishing alliances between groups, rather than simply a\n",
    "relationship between individuals. Monogamy – one husband and one\n",
    "wife – is only one form of marriage. Polygyny, marriage between a\n",
    "husband and more than one wife, and polyandry, between a wife and\n",
    "more than one husband, are found in many societies. Domestic life is\n",
    "also far more public and communal than it is in industrial societies.\n",
    "Each family unit is just a part of a much wider, cooperating group\n",
    "of mainly blood relatives associated with a local territory, usually a\n",
    "village. As in Medieval Europe, therefore, child-rearing is not considered the principal responsibility of parents alone, but involves a far\n",
    "greater number of people, relatives and non-relatives.\n",
    "Clearly, then, to hope to explain human life simply by reference to\n",
    "natural impulses common to all is to ignore the one crucial fact that\n",
    "sociology directs attention to: human behaviour varies according to\n",
    "the social settings in which people find themselves.\n",
    "Individualistic theories\n",
    "What of individualistic explanations? How useful is the argument that\n",
    "behaviour is the product of the psychological make-up of individuals?\n",
    "The employment of this kind of theory is extremely common. For\n",
    "4 An Introduction to Sociological Theories\n",
    "example, success or failure in education is often assumed to be merely\n",
    "a reflection of intelligence: bright children succeed and dim children\n",
    "fail. Criminals are often taken to be people with certain kinds of\n",
    "personality: they are usually seen as morally deficient individuals, lacking any real sense of right or wrong. Unemployed people are equally\n",
    "often condemned as ‘work-shy’, ‘lazy’ or ‘scroungers’ – inadequates\n",
    "who would rather ‘get something for nothing’ than work for it. Suicide\n",
    "is seen as the act of an unstable person – an act undertaken when, as\n",
    "coroners put it, ‘the balance of the mind was disturbed’. This kind of\n",
    "explanation is attractive for many people and has proved particularly\n",
    "resilient to sociological critique. But a closer look shows it to be\n",
    "seriously flawed.\n",
    "If educational achievement is simply a reflection of intelligence then\n",
    "why do children from manual workers’ homes do so badly compared\n",
    "with children from middle-class homes? It is clearly nonsensical to\n",
    "suggest that doing one kind of job rather than another is likely to\n",
    "determine the intelligence of your child. Achievement in education\n",
    "must in some way be influenced by the characteristics of a child’s\n",
    "background.\n",
    "Equally, the fact that the majority of people convicted of a crime\n",
    "come from certain social categories must cast serious doubt on the\n",
    "‘deficient personality’ theory. The conviction rate is highest for young\n",
    "males, especially blacks, who come from manual, working-class\n",
    "or unemployed backgrounds. Can we seriously believe that criminal\n",
    "personalities are likely to be concentrated in such social categories?\n",
    "As in the case of educational achievement, it is clear that the conviction of criminals must somehow be influenced by social factors.\n",
    "Again, is it likely that the million or so people presently unemployed are typically uninterested in working when the vast majority\n",
    "of them have been forced out of their jobs, either by ‘downsizing’ or\n",
    "by the failure of the companies they worked for – as a result of social\n",
    "forces quite outside their control?\n",
    "Suicide would seem to have the strongest case for being explained\n",
    "as a purely psychological act. But if it is simply a question of\n",
    "‘an unsound mind’, then why does the rate of suicide vary between\n",
    "societies? Why does it vary between different groups within the same\n",
    "society? Also, why do the rates within groups and societies remain\n",
    "remarkably constant over time? As in other examples, social factors\n",
    "must be exerting some kind of influence; explanations at the level of\n",
    "the personality are clearly not enough.\n",
    "Variations such as these demonstrate the inadequacy of theories of\n",
    "human behaviour which exclusively emphasize innate natural drives,\n",
    "An Introduction to Sociological Theories 5\n",
    "or the unique psychological make-up of individuals. If nature is at the\n",
    "root of behaviour, why does it vary according to social settings? If we\n",
    "are all different individuals acting according to the dictates of unique\n",
    "psychological influences, why do different people in the same social\n",
    "circumstances behave similarly and in ways others can understand?\n",
    "Clearly there is a social dimension to human existence, which requires\n",
    "sociological theorizing to explain it.\n",
    "All sociological theories thus have in common an emphasis on the\n",
    "way human belief and action is the product of social influences. They\n",
    "differ as to what these influences are, and how they should be investigated and explained. This book is about these differences.\n",
    "We shall now examine three distinct kinds of theory – consensus,\n",
    "conflict and action theories – each of which highlights specific social\n",
    "sources of human behaviour. Though none of the sociologists whose\n",
    "work we will spend the rest of the book examining falls neatly into\n",
    "any one of these three categories of theory, discussing them now will\n",
    "produce two benefits:\n",
    "• it will serve as an accessible introduction to theoretical debates in\n",
    "sociology; and\n",
    "• it will act as useful reference points against which to judge and\n",
    "compare the work of the subject’s major theorists.\n",
    "Society as a structure of rules\n",
    "The influence of culture on behaviour\n",
    "Imagine you live in a big city. How many people do you know well?\n",
    "Twenty? Fifty? A hundred? Now consider how many other people\n",
    "you encounter each day, about whom you know nothing. For example, how many complete strangers do people living in London\n",
    "or Manchester or Birmingham come into contact with each day? On\n",
    "the street, in shops, on buses and trains, in cinemas or night clubs\n",
    "– everyday life in a big city is a constant encounter with complete\n",
    "strangers. Yet even if city dwellers bothered to reflect on this fact,\n",
    "they would not normally leave their homes quaking with dread about\n",
    "how all these hundreds of strangers would behave towards them.\n",
    "Indeed, they hardly, if ever, think about it. Why? Why do we take\n",
    "our ability to cope with strangers so much for granted? It is because\n",
    "nearly all the people we encounter in our everyday lives do behave in\n",
    "ways we expect. We expect bus passengers, shoppers, taxi-drivers,\n",
    "6 An Introduction to Sociological Theories\n",
    "passers-by, and so on, to behave in quite definite ways even though\n",
    "we know nothing about them personally. City dwellers in particular\n",
    "– though it is true of all of us to some extent – routinely enter settings\n",
    "where others are going about their business both expecting not to\n",
    "know them, and yet also expecting to know how they will behave.\n",
    "And, more than this, we are nearly always absolutely right in both\n",
    "respects. We are only surprised if we encounter someone who is not a\n",
    "stranger – ‘Fancy meeting you here! Isn’t it a small world!’ – or if one\n",
    "of these strangers actually does behave strangely – ‘Mummy, why is\n",
    "that man shouting and waving his arms about?’ Why is this? Why do\n",
    "others do what we expect of them? Why is disorder or the unexpected\n",
    "among strangers so rare?\n",
    "Structural-consensus theory\n",
    "One of the traditional ways in which sociologists explain the order\n",
    "and predictability of social life is by regarding human behaviour as\n",
    "learned behaviour. This approach is known – for reasons that will\n",
    "become apparent – as structural-consensus theory. The key process\n",
    "this theory emphasizes is called socialization. This term refers to the\n",
    "way in which human beings learn the kinds of behaviour expected\n",
    "of them in the social settings in which they find themselves. From\n",
    "this point of view, societies differ because the kinds of behaviour\n",
    "considered appropriate in them differ. People in other societies think\n",
    "and behave differently because they have learned different rules about\n",
    "how to behave and think. The same goes for different groups within\n",
    "the same society. The actions and ideas of one group differ from\n",
    "those of another because its members have been socialized into different rules.\n",
    "Consensus sociologists use the term culture to describe the rules\n",
    "that govern thought and behaviour in a society. Culture exists prior\n",
    "to the people who learn it. At birth, humans are confronted by a\n",
    "social world already in existence. Joining this world involves learning\n",
    "‘how things are done’ in it. Only by learning the cultural rules of a\n",
    "society can a human interact with other humans. Because they have\n",
    "been similarly socialized, different individuals will behave similarly.\n",
    "Consensus theory thus argues that a society’s cultural rules determine, or structure, the behaviour of its members, channelling their\n",
    "actions in certain ways rather than others. They do so in much the\n",
    "same way that the physical construction of a building structures the\n",
    "actions of the people inside it. Take the behaviour of students in a\n",
    "An Introduction to Sociological Theories 7\n",
    "school. Once inside the school they will display quite regular patterns\n",
    "of behaviour. They will all walk along corridors, up and down stairs,\n",
    "in and out of classrooms, through doors, and so on. They will, by and\n",
    "large, not attempt to dig through floors, smash through walls, or\n",
    "climb out of windows. Their physical movements are constrained by\n",
    "the school building. Since this affects all the students similarly, their\n",
    "behaviour inside the school will be similar – and will exhibit quite\n",
    "definite patterns. In consensus theory, the same is true of social life.\n",
    "Individuals will behave similarly in the same social settings because\n",
    "they are equally constrained by cultural rules. Though these social\n",
    "structures are not visible in the way physical structures are, those who\n",
    "are socialized into their rules find them comparably determining.\n",
    "The levels at which these cultural rules operate can vary. Some\n",
    "rules, like laws for instance, operate at the level of the whole society\n",
    "and structure the behaviour of everyone who lives in it. Others are\n",
    "much less general, structuring the behaviour of people in quite specific social settings. For example, children in a classroom are expected\n",
    "to behave in an orderly and attentive fashion. In the playground\n",
    "much more license is given them, while away from school their behaviour often bears little resemblance to that expected of them during\n",
    "school hours. Similarly, when police officers or nurses or members of\n",
    "the armed forces are ‘on duty’, certain cultural rules structure their\n",
    "behaviour very rigidly. Out of uniform and off duty these constraints\n",
    "do not apply, though other ones do instead – those governing their\n",
    "behaviour as fathers and mothers, or husbands and wives, for instance.\n",
    "This shows how the theory of a social structure of cultural rules\n",
    "operates. The rules apply not to the individuals themselves, but to the\n",
    "positions in the social structure they occupy. Shoppers, police officers,\n",
    "traffic wardens, schoolteachers or pupils are constrained by the cultural expectations attached to these positions, but only when they\n",
    "occupy them. In other circumstances, in other locations in the social\n",
    "structure – as fathers or mothers, squash players, football supporters,\n",
    "church members, and so on – other rules come into play.\n",
    "Sociologists call positions in a social structure roles. The rules that\n",
    "structure the behaviour of their occupants are called norms. There\n",
    "are some cultural rules that are not attached to any particular role\n",
    "or set of roles. Called values, these are in a sense summaries of approved ways of living, and act as a base from which particular norms\n",
    "spring. So, for example: ‘education should be the key to success’;\n",
    "‘family relationships should be the most important thing to protect’;\n",
    "‘self-help should be the means to individual fulfilment’. All these\n",
    "are values, and they provide general principles from which norms\n",
    "8 An Introduction to Sociological Theories\n",
    "directing behaviour in schools and colleges, in the home and at work\n",
    "are derived.\n",
    "According to this sociological theory, socialization into norms\n",
    "and values produces agreement, or consensus, between people about\n",
    "appropriate behaviour and beliefs without which no human society\n",
    "can survive. This is why it is called structural-consensus theory.\n",
    "Through socialization, cultural rules structure behaviour, guarantee a\n",
    "consensus about expected behaviour, and thereby ensure social order.\n",
    "Clearly, in a complex society there are sometimes going to be competing norms and values. For example, while some people think it is\n",
    "wrong for mothers to go out to work, many women see motherhood\n",
    "at best as a real imposition and at worst as an infringement of their\n",
    "liberty. Children often encourage each other to misbehave at school\n",
    "and disapprove of their peers who refuse to do so. Teachers usually\n",
    "see this very much the other way round! The Tory Party Conference\n",
    "is annually strident in its condemnation of any speaker who criticizes\n",
    "the police. Some young blacks would be equally furious with any\n",
    "of their number who had other than a strongly belligerent attitude\n",
    "towards them.\n",
    "Consensus theorists explain such differences in behaviour and\n",
    "attitude in terms of the existence of alternative cultural influences,\n",
    "characteristic of different social settings. A good example of this\n",
    "emphasis is their approach to educational inequality.\n",
    "Educational inequality: a consensus theory analysis\n",
    "Educational research demonstrates, in the most conclusive fashion,\n",
    "that achievement in education is strongly linked to class membership,\n",
    "gender and ethnic origin. There is overwhelming evidence, for example, that working-class children of similar intelligence to children\n",
    "from middle-class backgrounds achieve far less academically than their\n",
    "middle-class counterparts.\n",
    "To explain this, consensus theorists turn to stock concepts in their\n",
    "approach to social life – norms, values, socialization and culture. Starting from the basic assumption that behaviour and belief are caused by\n",
    "socialization into particular rules, their explanation of working-class\n",
    "underachievement in education seeks to identify:\n",
    "• the cultural influences which propel middle-class children to academic success\n",
    "• the cultural influences which drag working-class children down to\n",
    "mediocrity.\"\"\""
