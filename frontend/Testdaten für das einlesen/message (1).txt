quantum mechanics does not allow the joint measurement of non - commuting observables .the uncertainty principle , usually described as lower bound on the product of standard deviations of the outcome statistics does not really capture this complementary feature as it ( uncertainty principle ) is a statement about the quantum state of the system and does not relate to an actual situation involving apparatus which can attempt a joint measurement .as intuition suggests one has to allow for some degree of imprecision in order to make room for a notion of joint measurement of non - commuting observables . in quantum mechanics of a single systemobservables correspond to self - adjoint operators with the outcome statistics given by the born rule , i.e if @xmath0 is the projector onto the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath1 then in a measurement of the observable the probability of obtaining the ith outcome when the system is in state @xmath2 is @xmath3 .however this is not adequate .for example , suppose a system is allowed to interact with another system(ancilla ) for a while and then measurement is done on the combined system .to describe the probabilities of obtaining various outcomes for such a measurement for different states of the original system before the interaction one has to replace the projectors above by positive operators @xmath4 ( actiing on the states of the original sysytem ) with @xmath5 for normalisation .such measurements are called povm ( positive operator valued measures ) measurements .the most general measurements possible in quantum mechanics can be described through povms .it turns out that the idea of imprecise or unsharp measurements can be appropriately investigated if one considers instead of projective measurements , povms .the observables corresponding to projective measurements form a subclass of those described by povms and are called sharp .    the first model for approximate joint measurement of position and momentum was given by arthur and kelly in ( 1965 ) by generalising von neumann s model for measurement.(@xcite ) in the von neumann s model for measurement , the position observable of the object is measured by coupling it to the momentum @xmath6 of a probe system via the interaction evolution @xmath7 and using the position @xmath8 of the probe as the readout observable .the idea of arthur - kelly was to couple two such probe systems respectively to the position and momentum of the system and then perform measurement on the commuting meter observables of the probe to gain information about the position and momenta of the system .this is in fact an unsharp joint measurement and inspired the later development of the formalism .epr - bell argument for unsharp realities was given in @xcite ; the bounds on joint measurement of qubit observables were derived starting from the condition of operational locality in @xcite ; the formalism for qubit observables and relevant inequalities for the two observable case were developed in @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite .the connection of approximate joint measurement with bell inequalities were investigated in @xcite ; joint measurements by quantum cloning has been invesigated for example in @xcite and @xcite.it has also been used to estimate the expectation values of qubit observables in @xcite ; joint unsharp measurement of position and momentum was treated in @xcite and @xcite .    in this paperwe consider an arthur - kelly like model for approximate joint measurement separately , of two and three non - commuting qubit observables .the probe systems we employ are continuous as typically in experiments like stern - gerlach deviations in position or momenta of particles carrying spin are measured to obtain information about the system spin state .we consider characterisation of unsharpnesss or quality of approximation by two ways existing in literature .firstly by considering closeness of the marginal probability distribution of the probability distribution of joint measurement to that of the sharp observable being approximately measured .secondly by considering suitably defined closeness of the observables themselves with the meter observables in the heisenberg picture .we show that for a symmetric joint measurement where the two marginal probability distributions are equally close to the corresponding sharp probability distributions , the two measures of closeness are proportional .error - disturbance relationship does not seem to hold for the measure based on the heisenberg picture for our choice of the pointer observable .we also prove a lemma showing the connection between joint measurement , and the symmetries of the underlying hamiltonian of the measurement interaction together with that of the initial detector states .this is then used to perform approximate joint measurement in arbitrary directions . moving on to the case of three - observable joint unsharp measurement we prove a simple necessary condition that is sufficient for the case of three orthogonal observables .the case of three orthogonal observables also generalises the validity of the known necessary - sufficient condition for this case .this condition is derived from certain geometrical considerations based on the so called fermat - toricelli point .we show that it yields the known two - observable bounds in the limit that the measurement of one of the observables is pure guessing of the value of the observable .numerical analysis is performed for the two observable case to show the validity of measurement uncertainty relations , transition from povm to projection - valued measurement and also the effect of the joint measurement on the system .similar analysis is also performed for the three - observable case .the paper is organised as follows . in sectionii we introduce the joint unsharp spin measurement and the original arthur - kelly model given for the joint measurement of position and momentum .measures characterising the quality of approximations to the sharp observables being approximated are introduced in section iii .the corresponding measurement uncertainty relations are discussed . in sectioniv we introduce the arthur - kelly like model for qubits that we have considered and derive the final state of the sysytem and meters after the measurement interaction .approximate joint measurement of @xmath9 and @xmath10 is considered in section v. section vi deals with the effect of the initial detector states on the joint measurement and post - measurement state of the system . in section viiwe explore through a lemma the connection between the symmetries of the underlying hamiltonian of the measurement interaction and initial detector states on the joint measurement .this is used in section viii to do joint measurement of spin in arbitrary directions.the corresponding povm elements are also calculated and matched with the orthogonal case in section v. in section ix we compute the spin direction fidelities , which were introduced as a measure of quality of approximation in section iii , for the model considered .it is compared with another measure based on distance between outcome probabilities of sharp observables and their unsharp approximations .approximate joint measurement of three qubit observables is considered in section x. a necessary condition on the parameters of the marginal povm elements is derived by geometric considerations involving the fermat - toricelli point .the suffciency of the condition is explored and the restrictions placed by it investigated in the context of joint measurement through an extension of the model considered in section iv to three detectors .suppose we want to measure the spin of a spin-@xmath11 particle along a direction given by the unit vector @xmath12 .if the system is described by the density matrix @xmath2 , then probabilities for obtaining outcomes @xmath13 are given in the povm formalism , respectively by @xmath14 and @xmath15 .the povm elements @xmath16 and @xmath17 are called effects .one says that the observable a is charaterised by specification of the map @xmath18 where @xmath19 belongs to the set of outcomes with @xmath20(e.g here @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) . if @xmath23 i.e a projector into the up state of @xmath24 then the measurement is called a sharp measurement of @xmath24 and the observable characterised by @xmath25 a sharp observable .else the measurement and the corresponding observable is called unsharp .one way such a measurement can occur is the following .suppose some one wants to do a standard ( sharp)measurement of @xmath26 but because of some error in his setup there is a finite probabilty of registering the outcome - when the system is actually in the state @xmath27 and vice versa. this will be an unsharp measurement with the probabilities of error given by @xmath28 and @xmath29 .such a situation can arise if for example in a stern - gerlach setup , the beam passing through the inhomogeneous magnetic field is poorly collimated initially .@xcite .two observables are said to be jointly measurable if there is a measurement scheme that allows the determination of values of both the observables .this means that the povm describing the measurement scheme contains the povm elements of the two observables as marginals . in this way it is ensured that there is a joint probability distribution corresponding to the pairs of different values of the two observables for each state .two observables @xmath30 and @xmath31 are jointly measurable if there is an observable @xmath32 such that , @xmath33    with the povm elements @xmath34 satisfying , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .the outcomes @xmath37 of g can be taken to be the pairs @xmath38 .the map implies that the probability of registering outcome , say ( + , + ) is given by @xmath39 and so on .the extension to three observables is done in the obvious way .two observables @xmath30 and @xmath31 are said to commute if @xmath40 .the possibility of joint measurability is guaranteed by the following theorem which we state without proof.(@xcite )    * theorem 1 * : a pair of sharp observables is jointly measurable iff they commute .commutativity of unsharp observables is sufficient but not necessary for joint measurability .as mentioned earlier arthur and kelly gave a model for joint measurement of position and momentum.@xcite in this model a quantum object is coupled with two probe systems which are then individually measured to obtain information about objects position and momentum .the coupling to probes is based on von - neumann s model of measurement .they showed that this constitutes a simultaneous measurement of position and momentum in the sense that the output statistics reproduce the expectation values of the object s position and momentum .the position @xmath41 and momentum @xmath42 of the object are coupled with the position @xmath43 and the momentum @xmath44 of the two probe systems respectively which serve as the readout observables . neglecting the free evolutions of the three systems ( assuming that the measurement interaction dominates during the short time in which it acts ) the combined time evolutionis described by , @xmath45 the coupling constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 represent the interaction strength and can be absorbed into a rescaling of the pointer observables @xmath48 and @xmath49 . if @xmath50 is an arbitrary input state of the object and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are fixed initial state of the probes ( well - behaved and zero expectations for each of the probe s position and momentum ) , the probabilities for values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 to lie in intervals of length @xmath53 and @xmath54 are determined through a joint observable @xmath55 @xcite , analogous to the one defined in eqn .( [ eqjoint ] ) , through @xmath56 the marginals are given by @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 represent the set of all possible values respectively of @xmath48 and @xmath49.they play the same role as @xmath61 and @xmath62 in [ eqjoint ] , with for example the probability to obtain @xmath48 in an interval @xmath53 ( about @xmath63)after the approximate joint measurement given by @xmath64 with @xmath65   $ ] .the cost of the joint measurement is an increase in the variance of the marginals given by , @xmath66 where , @xmath67 .the notion of approximate joint measurement naturally demands a measure of proximity to the sharp observables being approximately measured .the restriction on the measures corresponding to non - commuting observables leads one to measurement uncertainty relations.in this paper we use two such approaches to characterise proximity .proximity between two observables can be characterised by the distance between the corresponding probability distributions for all states .thus distance between two observables @xmath68 and @xmath69 can be defined as @xmath70 - tr[tb_j]|\ ] ] where @xmath71 corresponds to the povm element(or effect ) of the observable a ( or b ) associated with the measurement outcome j. @xmath72 is the density matrix of the sysytem.@xcite    for two single - qubit observables @xmath73 , @xmath74 with , @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 . now for observables @xmath68 , @xmath69 with respective set of effects @xmath78 , @xmath79 we have @xmath80 - tr[tb_+]|= |tr[ta_- ] - tr[tb_-]|$ ] .taking t to be the @xmath81 state or @xmath82 state of @xmath83 according as @xmath84 or @xmath85 one has , @xmath86 this shows that the distance of a certain unsharp observable @xmath73 from any sharp observable @xmath87 is minimum when @xmath88 is along @xmath12 .observables of the form @xmath89 are called unbiased . as @xmath90 , therefore the probability of occurence of outcomes + ( or - ) for the initial state @xmath91 ( the maximally mixed state )is given by , @xmath92 = \frac{1}{2 }    \left ( \mbox{or   } tr [ \frac{i}{2}.\frac{1}{2}(i- \frac{\vec{a}.\vec{\sigma})}{|\vec{a}| } ) ] = \frac{1}{2 } \right )   $ ] .so these two probabilities are same .hence the name unbiased.    for such an observable , both the outcomes are equally likely for a maximally mixed state .also , the expectation value of the unsharp measurement when the system is in state t is given by @xmath93 .again as , @xmath94 , @xmath95 itself serves as a measure of proximity .we will often approximate sharp observables with unbiased unsharp ones .we will choose jointly measurable observable pairs @xmath96 to approximate the sharp pair @xmath97 .the necessary and sufficient conditions on @xmath98 so that the first pair is jointly measurable in the sense of [ eqjoint ] is formulated in @xcite,@xcite , @xcite . when the observables are unbiased the conditions simplify to , @xmath99 with , @xmath100 , @xmath101 being the angle between @xmath102 and @xmath103 .the conditions for attainment @xmath104 were also spelt out .the approximate observables should be unbiased , i.e @xmath105 in this later case .the other conditions imply that for optimality , @xmath88 and @xmath106 lie along @xmath12 and @xmath107 respectively , only when the latter are orthogonal @xcite .a completely different approach was taken in references @xcite and @xcite in the context of the original arthur - kelly model to give a formulation of the complementary nature of the approximate joint measurement process .if @xmath108 and @xmath109 denote the pointer observables used to measure the system position and momentum respectively , then the retrodictive error operators are defined as , @xmath110 the predictive error operators as , @xmath111 and the disturbance operators as , @xmath112 where operators @xmath113 , appearing on right stands for the final heisengberg picture operator @xmath114 after the measurement interaction u , i.e , @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the heisenberg picture operator at the moment the interaction starts .various errors were then defined by taking the square root of expectation of the square of the operators defined above and taking supremum over the system states .for example the maximal error of retrodiction was defined as , @xmath117 and similarly for @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122(see @xcite , @xcite for details ) .measurement uncertainty or error principle was shown to hold in the form of , @xmath123 and extensions of the above uncertainties in the obvious way .one of the important features of this approach is the difference between error of retrodiction and that of prediction .it was shown that these are not the same as long as there is a finite disturbance .      in a similar spirit for the case of approximate joint measurement of qubit observables through an arthur - kelly like process fidelities were defined in the heisenberg picture that would provide a notion of direction of spin @xcite of the system . as in the previous case distinctionwas made between errors of retrodiction and prediction . in this paperwe consider only the type 1 measurements considered by the author .we next consider the fidelities as defined by the authors .the retrodictive fidelity is defined as , @xmath124 where , @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the initial values of the heisenberg spin and pointer observables and @xmath127 and @xmath128 be the final heisenberg spin and pointer direction observables after the measurement interaction .the predictive fidelity is defined as , @xmath129    the measurement disturbance by , @xmath130 the intuition behind the above definitions is classical in the sense that it considers alignment of initial or final spin vector and initial or final pointer direction.but the above fidelities were used to define maximal rms error of retrodiction , @xmath131 maximal rms error of prediction , @xmath132 and maximal rms disturbance @xmath133 where the spin @xmath134 for our case and @xmath135 .the quantities @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 were expected to play the same role for these measurements as similar quantities defined for the original arthur - kelly model .the authors in ref.@xcite also showed that the retodictive and predictive fidelities reach their optimal values of @xmath139 when the krauss operators of the measurement povm have a spin - coherent form defined using spin coherent states . a physical model for such a measurement was given in @xcite .no measurement uncertainties were derived in @xcite and the question was left open for further investigation .we consider an instantaneous coupling interaction with the help of the hamiltonian of the form , @xmath140 ( in @xmath141=1 units ) possible coupling constants in the above equation like @xmath46 and @xmath47 in equation [ eqakinteraction ] have been absorbed by rescaling @xmath142 and @xmath143 . like the original arthur - kelly interaction ( [ eqakinteraction ] )the idea is to entangle the detectors with the system through @xmath144 and then perform a projective measurement of @xmath145 , @xmath146 to obtain the spin information .now , as a consequence of the ehrenfest theorem the average momentum change of a particle carrying spin that experiences the above interaction is given by @xmath147 and @xmath148 .thus , an ensemble of particles whose spin state is @xmath149 and which has a symmetric distribution of @xmath150 before the interaction will have a greater probability of having a positive @xmath150 after it.the signs in equation ( [ model ] ) have been chosen so that this is true for both x and y directions .the signs thus allow us to map the four quadrants of the momentum plane ( @xmath151 ) to the four outcomes of joint measurement and take the signs of the momenta to correspond to the outcomes ( + , + ) , ( + , -),(-,+ ) , ( -,- ) of the joint measurement .note that for a stern - gerlach situation the two terms in eqn .( [ model ] ) should have opposite signs to satisfy divergenceless of magnetic field .models similar to above have been considered before for example in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . as shown in @xcitethis model naturally arises in the context of a stern - gerlach experiment with a linear magnetic field .we further assume that the measurement interaction ( [ model ] ) is strong enough to dominate the other parts of the hamiltonian during its presence ( e.g , the kinetic energy part ) . in the stern - gerlach contextthis would mean to assume the atoms carrying spin to be sufficiently massive .the unitary evolution corresponding to the hamiltonian of equation ( [ model ] ) is given by ,    @xmath152    on direct expansion , u turns out to have the simple form , @xmath153    thus , the final state of the system is given by @xmath154 .let , @xmath155 .in this section we consider the joint measurement of @xmath9 and @xmath10.we choose the observables @xmath156 and @xmath146 to serve as meters .as mentioned before , @xmath157 is taken to correspond to the outcome @xmath158 of joint measurement , @xmath159 to ( + , - ) , @xmath160 to ( -,+ ) and @xmath161 to ( -,- ) .after the interaction u between the system and meters , projective measurement is performed separately on the meters @xmath145 and @xmath146 .the probability of obtaining outcome @xmath162 is given by ,    @xmath163    with @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 representing respectively the fourier transforms of @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 .the initial states are taken to be gaussian , @xmath170    we have chosen the initial states to be even in @xmath142 , @xmath143 . now as fourier transform of a purely real even function is a purely real even function and that of a purely imaginary odd function is a purely real odd function we have @xmath165 odd in @xmath150 and even in @xmath171 , @xmath172the other way around and @xmath164 even in both.also , each of them is real .thus , the @xmath173 term in ( [ probability ] ) vanishes .henceforth in this paper we refer to these properties of @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 as `` parity properties '' .we have for the probability of outcome ( + , + ) from equation ( [ probability ] ) , @xmath174    one also of course has to satisfy , @xmath175 which yields due to the `` parity properties '' , @xmath176    from equation ( [ probnorm ] ) and `` parity properties '' we have , @xmath177 with , @xmath178 and @xmath179 for the other outcomes , we have from consideration of the corresponding momentum probabilities , @xmath180    from equations ( [ jm - povm1 ] ) and ( [ jm - povm2 ] ) we get the marginal unsharp observables as , ( see eqn .( [ eqjoint ] ) ) @xmath181 thus , we see that the approximate observables @xmath182 , @xmath183 are unbiased and @xmath184 and @xmath185 themselves serve as measures of proximity to the sharp observables @xmath186 and @xmath187 , respectively .in section [ section - povmsym ] we will see how the approximate joint measurement , characterised by the marginals in eqn .( [ povm - marginal ] ) arise as a consequence of symmetries of the hamiltonian in eqn,([model ] ) and that of the initial detector states @xmath188 and @xmath189 ( given in eqns .( [ inistate1 ] ) and ( [ inistate2 ] ) ) .      in this sectionwe consider the effect of approximate joint measurement of @xmath9 and @xmath10 on the state of the system .we consider the case when the result of the measurement on the meters turns out to be : @xmath190 $ ] , i.e the outcome ( + , + ) of the joint measurement has clicked .the reduced unnormalised state of the entire system plus the two apparatuses when we concentrate on the pointer values @xmath190 $ ] , is given by , @xmath191    suppose the initial system state is @xmath192 . to obtain the post - measurement statistics for the systemthe detector parts are traced out and we have , after normalisation , the following density matrix of the system : @xmath193 with , @xmath194the form of the povm elements in eqns.([jm - povm1 ] ) , ( [ jm - povm2 ] ) only depends on the  parity properties  and not on the gaussian form of the initial detector states given by eqns .( [ inistate1 ] ) , ( [ inistate2 ] ) . for computing the post measurement statistics ,the bloch vector of the initial state @xmath195 of the system is chosen to be @xmath196 ( so that the state uncertainty product @xmath197 is minimum ) .the integrals for computing the coefficients @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 have been done using the monte carlo integrator included in gnu scientific library .the miser algorithm has been used which uses stratified random sampling for doing importance sampling @xcite.the parseval s theorem can be used to convert the integrals in @xmath201 , @xmath202 to configuration space , e.g , @xmath203      as we are considering unbiased approximate joint measurement in orthogonal directions , eqn .( [ eqajmuncer ] ) applied on the parameters @xmath184 and @xmath185 of the marginals in eqn .( [ povm - marginal ] ) yield , @xmath204      in this case the standard deviations @xmath205 and @xmath206 of the initial momentum wavefunctions in eqns .( [ inistate1 ] ) and ( [ inistate2 ] ) are taken to be equal . as there is nothing else that differentiates between the detectors one has @xmath207 .this is reflected in eqn .( [ povm - constants ] ) .both the observables @xmath9 and @xmath10 are approximated equally well . from eqn .( [ ajm - ortho ] ) we have , @xmath208 .    [[ quality ] ] quality : + + + + + + + +    in figure [ figsym ] we see that when @xmath205 and @xmath206 are close to zero , which corresponds to the fact that the initial momenta @xmath150 , @xmath209 have large spread we have almost no information about the spin state by looking at the momentum.in this case @xmath184 and @xmath185 are both close to zero and we have trivial marginal effects ( @xmath210 ) which represent guessing the value of the observable with equal probability for + and - . with increase in @xmath205 , @xmath184 increases and touches .628 at @xmath211.(see figure [ fig - a ] ) .the graph of @xmath184 vrs .@xmath205 is identical to the one obtained in @xcite for the same case .[ [ noise ] ] noise : + + + + + +    as mentioned earlier , the initial system state is chosen so that @xmath212 . in the post measurement state this product almost reaches 1 , showing that there is considerable increase in noise in the system(see fig .[ fig - uncersym ] ) .the state also becomes mixed with the bloch vector magnitude around 0.5 ( see fig .[ fig - magsym ] ) .\a ) let us choose @xmath214 .the lhs of eqn .( [ ajm - ortho ] ) starts off at a low value for @xmath215 and gradually increases and closes on the bound ( 1.0 ) as @xmath206 becomes much greater than @xmath205.(see figure [ fig - aprbprap1 ] ) @xmath216 much greater than @xmath205 reflects the situation where the initial momentum wavefunction of apparatus 2 is much sharper than that of appararus 1 .as shown clearly by figure [ fig - aprbprap1 ] this marks a transition from a povm measurement to a projection - valued measurement(pvm ) in the sense that the unsharp measurement of @xmath10 becomes almost sharp .the requirement of complementarity is satisfied by the fact that the unsharp @xmath9 measurement becomes almost trivial .the fact that @xmath184 and @xmath185 depend both on a and b is a reflection of the entanglement between @xmath150 and @xmath209 brought about by eqn .( [ unitary ] ) .the povm to pvm transition does not have much effect that differ from fig .[ figsym ] on the state uncertainty product and bloch vector magnitude .however because in order to examine the post - measurement statistics the ( + , + ) outcome was considered , the bloch vector points almost along y direction ( see fig .[ blochdirfig ] ) .this has been seen to hold independant of the choice of the initial state of the system .\b ) next we choose @xmath217. the conclusions are almost similar with the exception that the joint measurement uncertainty ( i.e the l.h.s of eqn .( [ eqajmuncer ] ) starts off at a much higher value ( see fig .3 ) .    [ fig - aprbpra1 ]     and @xmath185 vrs .b , a=1.0 .bottom curve shows @xmath184 and top curve shows @xmath185,height=188 ]it was shown in @xcite in the context of a stern - gerlach type hamiltonian how the symmetries of the underlying hamiltonian like the one given in eqn .( [ model ] ) can be used to do some particular unsharp measurement .the various cases considered there can be seen to follow from the following lemma .consider an arthur -

ajmortho ] yields the momentum values @xmath150 , @xmath209 ( which can also be considered as components of @xmath314 ) .alternatively , in polar coordinates we can look at the magnitude of the momentum @xmath314 and its angle @xmath315 with the x - axis in the momentum plane .this angle uniquely fixes the direction of normalised momentum meter @xmath316 , and this is what we take for @xmath12 in this section .    the joint unsharp measurement on the system through measurement on the commuting meter observables after the meters have interacted with the system , yields the povm described by eqns .( [ jm - povm1 ] ) and ( [ jm - povm2 ] ) .the effect of the measurement on the system ( a completely - positive map acting on the system density matrix ) can be described by krauss operators for the measurement @xmath317 .they are defined as follows by considering the average density matrix of the system @xmath318 after the measurement on the meters , considering all possible outcomes :    @xmath319    the probability of registering the outcome at an angle @xmath101 in the @xmath150 , @xmath209 plane is given by @xmath320 , with the angle povm @xmath321    the fidelities were verified to be expressable in terms of e and t as , ( see @xcite ) @xmath322 | \chi \rangle \\ \eta_f & = & { inf}_{|\chi \rangle \in h_{sys } } \langle \chi |\left [ \int t^{\dagger } \hat{n } \cdot \vec{s } t p dp d\theta \right ] | \chi \rangle \\ \eta_d & = & { inf}_{|\chi \rangle \in h_{sys } } \langle \chi |\left [ \int \sum_{i=1}^3   \langle \chi \frac{1}{2}(t^{\dagger } s_i t s_i + s_it^{\dagger } s_i t ) p dp d\theta \right]| \chi \rangle   \end{aligned}\ ] ]    with t in our case given by , @xmath323    from ( [ etheta ] ) we have , @xmath324 hence , @xmath325.\ ] ]    so from eqn .( [ etaidef ] ) , @xmath326 \nonumber\\   = & \int_0^{\infty}\int_0^{2\pi}e^0{f^0}^*cos(\theta)+e^0{g^0}^*sin(\theta)pdpd\theta + \int_0^{\infty}\int_0^{2\pi } ( |e^0|^2 + |f^0|^2 +   |g^0|^2)cos(\theta)pdpd\theta \langle \chi|\sigma_x|\chi \rangle \nonumber\\      & + \int_0^{\infty}\int_0^{2\pi}(|e^0|^2 + |f^0|^2 +   |g^0|^2)sin(\theta)pdpd\theta   \langle\chi|\sigma_y|\chi \rangle \end{aligned}\ ] ] changing back to cartesian coordinates we have , @xmath327 the last two terms on the rhs of eqn .( [ etaical ] ) vanish because the 3rd term is is odd in @xmath150 and the 4th one is odd in @xmath209 .    now using ( [ e1f1 ] ) we have , @xmath328 thus , @xmath329    [ [ bound -

ortho ] ) allows @xmath184 to go till .707 .this is because eqn .( [ ajm - ortho ] ) refers to the most general approximate joint measurement in orthogonal directions without reference to any arthur - kelly kind of an implementation .( [ etai - a ] ) shows that the error of retrodiction ( given in eqn .( [ retroerror ] ) ) falls as the measurement becomes sharp .a similar calculation shows that , @xmath331\sigma_x + [ sin(\theta ) ( |e^0|^2 - |f^0|^2 \nonumber\\    & + |g^0|^2 ) + 2re(f^0{g^0}^*)cos(\theta)]\sigma_y + [ e^0f^0cos(\theta ) + e^0g^0sin(\theta)]1_s ] |\chi \rangle\end{aligned}\ ] ] and , @xmath332| \chi\rangle .\ ] ]    thus , as in the case of original arthur - kelly model , the fidelities are independant of the initial sysytem state@xcite .again , because of the parity of various terms present there @xmath333 turns out to be the same as @xmath330 .    from the probability normalisation condition given in eqn .( [ probnorm ] ) we have @xmath334 , _ independant of initial apparatus state and @xmath330 , @xmath333 . _    this shows that any error - disturbance relationship between error of retrodiction/ prediction and error of disturbance does not hold for all choices of the direction pointer observable .an approximate joint measurement observable for three unsharp qubit observables is defined by extending conditions given in ( [ jointpovm ] ) in the obvious way . unlike the two observable case no necessary as well as sufficient condition for the approximate joint measurement on the marginal effect parameters in @xmath335 ( like the ones derived for example in @xcite ) is known .no measurement uncertainty relation like equation ( [ mur ] ) , but which is stronger than the relations applied pairwise is known . here, we derive a necessary condition on the approximate joint measurement of three qubit observables which yields the familiar necessary - suffficient condition known in literature for the case of mutually orthogonal unbiased observables ( to be discussed below ) .we show that it holds even when the observables are unbiased . also when one of the measurements is trivial i.e the corresponding marginal effect is @xmath91 representing equiprobable guesses of the values of the observable , our condition reproduces equation ( [ eqajmuncer ] ) .the eight joint effects @xmath336 , @xmath337, .......... ,@xmath338 have to satisfy six marginality conditions like @xmath339 a joint measurement of three observables gives rise to three two - observable joint measurements .let @xmath340 denote the joint measurement marginal effect corresponding to the outcome ( + + ) in directions 1 and 2 . then seven of the the effects ( @xmath336,@xmath337 , etc . )can be written in terms of the three single - observable marginal effects , three pairwise joint measurement marginal effects and @xmath336 , as follows : @xmath341 it was shown in @xcite that any set of effects for joint measurement of two observables ( defined in eqn.([jointpovm ] ) ) can be written in the form    @xmath342    with @xmath343 and the two single - qubit marginal effects given by , @xmath344 and @xmath345 with positivity constraint being @xmath346 and @xmath347 .condition [ gfortwo ] is true because for the two observable case all the effects can be expressed in terms of one effect ( say @xmath348 ) and the marginals ( @xcite ) .the freedom in @xmath349 suffices to specify an arbitrary @xmath348 .it then follows from equation [ gfortwo ] that the set of joint effects for the three observable case is of the form , @xmath350 , [ \vec{z } ] ) = & ( 1+ax+by+cz+abz_1 + bcz_2 + caz_3 + abcz_4 + ( ab\vec{z_1 } + bc\vec{z_2 } + ca\vec{z_3 }   \nonumber \\ & + abc\vec{z_4}+a\vec{l } + b\vec{m}+ c\vec{n}))/8\end{aligned}\ ] ] with , @xmath351 , the two - marginals @xmath352 , @xmath353 , @xmath354 given by eqn .[gfortwo ] and the one marginals being @xmath355 , @xmath356 , @xmath357 .given the positivity of the one marginals , the positivity of the eight joint effects places restrictions on the marginal effect parameters which are interpreted as measurement uncertainty relatons in contrast to the usual state uncertainty relations .[ fig : cuboid ]    ) - ( [ inequality4 ] ) .solid spheres about the centres a ( with @xmath371 ) , b ( with @xmath372 ) , c ( with @xmath373 ) and d ( with @xmath374 ) and radii @xmath375 , @xmath376 , @xmath377 , @xmath378 respectively have to intersect so that the sum of their radii is 4.,height=264 ]    the above inequalities ( [ eqiii ] ) - ( [ inequality4 ] ) imply that we have a cuboid with edges @xmath379 , @xmath380 and @xmath381 with origin at the centre of this cuboid and solid spheres about points a ( @xmath382 ) , b(@xmath383 ) , c ( @xmath384 ) and d ( @xmath385)have to intersect so that the sum of the radii of the spheres is 4 ( see fig . 5 ) .that is we necessarily have :    @xmath386 , the fermat - toricelli ( ft ) point of the set is defined to be the point which minimises the sum of distances from that point in @xmath387 to the points of the set .the f - t point has been studied for quite long and its properties for any set of four non - coplanar points are well known .( @xcite ) .for example , it is known that the f - t point either belongs to the set itself or else it is the point at which the gradient of the sum of distances vanish .thus choosing @xmath388 to be the f - t point of the set of points a , b , c , d one necesarily has ( according to the definition of the f - t point ) , @xmath389 denotes the f - t point .      in order to evaluate the f - t point for a particular set of points a ,b , c , d , defined above we will use the following theorem from ref .@xcite ( theorem 2.1 ) , due to lorentz lindelf and sturm .* theorem 2 : * suppose @xmath388 is the f - t point for a set of points @xmath390 then either @xmath388 belongs to the set @xmath391 or @xmath392 .\i ) if @xmath393 then for @xmath394 , for some @xmath395 with @xmath396    \ii ) if @xmath392 then @xmath388 is the point at which @xmath397    thus , for the first case the resultant of unit vectors to the ft point from other points of the set has magnitude less than 1 . in the second case the unit vectors from the f - t point to the points of the set add up to the null vector .the condition for the second case is also the condition for the gradient of the function representing the sum of distances from @xmath388 to @xmath398 , for @xmath399 , to vanish at @xmath388 .suppose we are considering the case of approximate joint measurement in three orthogonal directions @xmath400 , @xmath401 and @xmath402 . in this casewe have , @xmath403 . hence , at the origin(@xmath404 ) of the cuboid ( see fig .5 ) we have , @xmath405 hence equation ( [ fermat - condition ] ) gives , @xmath406 this condition was shown to be suffficient in @xcite .the necessity of this condition was shown in @xcite assuming unbiasedness of the marginals ( i.e @xmath407 in eqn .( [ gforthree ] ) ) by considering measurements by two parties on a singlet state .we have shown above that this is true for biased cases as well .sufficiency of the above condition ( [ nec - suff ] ) shows that condition ( [ fermat - condition ] ) is sufficient for the case of approxiamte joint measurement in three orthogonal directions .also note that condition ( [ nec - suff ] ) is stronger than pairwise conditions for two - observable joint measurement in orthogonal directions like ( [ ajm - ortho ] ) which when added produces the bound of 1.5 on the lhs of equation ( [ nec - suff ] ) .suppose our joint measurement scheme is such that some approximate joint measurement on two observables is performed while the value of the third observable is guessed with probabilty of + being @xmath408 and that of - being @xmath409 .this will correspond to @xmath410 i.e the corresponding marginal @xmath411 . in this casethe points a(@xmath412 ) , b(@xmath413 ) , c(@xmath414 ) and d ( @xmath415 ) form a parallalogram of lenth @xmath416 and @xmath417 about the origin o .oa and ob lie opposite to each other and so does oc and od .thus , condition ( ii ) of the theorem 2 is satisfied and the origin is the f - t point .hence , condition ( [ fermat - condition ] ) reproduces equation ( [ eqajmuncer ] ) which shows that the bounds on the unsharpnesses is not more stringent than the two -observable case , as is to be expected .      the case for three qubits proceedsexactly as that of two qubits with the hamiltonian of the measurement interaction of the form , @xmath418 .the nature of the interaction is impulsive as in eqn .( [ model ] ) and the corresponding unitary evolution is given by , @xmath419 with , @xmath420 the intial joint state of the three detectors and system is @xmath421 .as before , the initial detector states are gaussians : @xmath422 , @xmath423 and @xmath424 .the detector outcome ( @xmath425 ) is taken here to correspond to the outcome ( + , + , + ) for the joint unsharp measurement of the system observables @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath173 ; ( @xmath426 ) to ( + , + , - ) and so on .the povm elemnts corresponding to the outcomes ( + + + ) , ( + + - ) , etc . of the joint unsharp measurement of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath173 have a similar structure to that for the case of two observables : @xmath427 , @xmath428 , ...... @xmath429 with , @xmath430      with the initial joint pointer state a symmetric gaussian , as in the two observable case , we have for the unsharp measurement along any three directions @xmath431 , the marginal effects@xmath432 , @xmath433 and @xmath434 . thus from eqn .( [ nec - suff ] ) we have @xmath184 to be bounded by @xmath435 . numerically , for our scheme , @xmath184 is seen to be able to reach upto about 0.49 .it can not reach the bound 0.577,as for two - observable joint measurement.(see fig .6 ) .    for approximate joint measurement in the directions @xmath436 , @xmath437 , @xmath438 with @xmath439 , @xmath440 and @xmath441 , the fermat- toricelli point of the set of points a , b , c , d , as defined before , is seen to be at @xmath383 .this yields , from inequality ( [ fermat - condition ] ) , @xmath442 .thus , as for the two observable case , more freedom is available for unbiased measurement in non - orthogonal directions .[ aprimesym ]non - commuting observables can not be measured joinly .however it is possible in the povm formalism to do joint measurements of ( generally non - commuting ) observables which are approximations of the actual non - commuting observables and called unsharp observables .we have considered in this paper approximate joint measurement of two and three qubit observables separtely , through an arthur - kelly like model for qubit observables.this model comes naturally when one considers a stern - gerlach setup with a linear magnetic field . in stern - gerlach setupthe momenta of the atoms acts as pointer observables for their spin degrees of freedom . considering approximate joint measurement of @xmath9 and @xmath10 through this model ,we have shown here numerically that measurement uncertainty relations derived elsewhere(see ref.@xcite ) hold .it has also been shown how increasing the relative sharpness of the initial momentum wavefunctions of the detectors leads measurement of one observable to become almost sharp while that of the other to become almost trivial .effect of initial detector states on the post - measurement state of the sysytem has also been considerd .we have considered two different characterisations of unsharpness .firstly , by comparing the probability distribution of the observable to be approximately measured with that of the approximate observable . secondly , by considering the alignment of the momemtum direction with the spin observable in the heisenberg picture . we have shown that for the case in which both the observables are approximated equally well , the corresponding measures of unsharpness are proportional . for our choice of pointerobservable the measures checking the alignment and disturbance due to measurement do not seem to satisfy an error - disturbance relationship .we have expounded the connecion between the symmetries of the underlying hamiltonian for measurement interaction and initial detector states with the joint measurement in a lemma.this was first stated by martens et al.(@xcite ) .it has then been used to perform approximate joint measurement in arbitrary directions .the povm elements calculated for the same match with that which were found earlier in the orthogonal case .they also turn expectedly to that of a single unsharp measurement when the directions are taken to be almost same .    for the case of joint unsharp measurement of three qubit observableswe have given a necessary condition to be satisfied by the parameters of the marginal povm elements .this condition has been derived from certain geometric considerations involving the so called fermat - toricelli point .the condition is sufficient for the case of three orthogonal observables and identical to the only necessary - sufficient condition known for three -observable joint measurements .our proof shows that this also holds for biased unsharp measurements , namely those in which the probabilty of obtaining up or down is different for a maximally mixed state .    the measurement scheme employed by us for joint measurement in non - orthogonal directions can not take advantage of the greater freedom available for better approximation compared to the orthogonal case .it will be interesting to see such a scheme in the arthur - kelly setup that is able to get close to the bound set by ( eqn.[eqajmuncer ] ) for arbitrary directions .we have shown that the retrodictive fidelity @xmath330 and the unsharpness @xmath184 are proportional for the symmetric joint unsharp measurement case that we have considered .it may be possible to connect the two pictures in a more general settig starting with certain symmetries of the hamiltonian and initial detector states .the problem of determining necessary - sufficient conditions for the most general joint measurement of three observables by extension of our approach or otherwise is also left open .the authors would like to thank syed raghib hasaan and rajeev singh for useful discussions .99 d. m. appleby , _ int .phys . _ * 37 * , 1491 ( 1998 ) .e. arthurs and j. r. kelly , _ bell . syst . tech .j. _ , * 44 * , 725 ( 1965 ) .h. martens and w. m de muync , _ j. phys . a : math .* 26 * , 2001 ( 1993 ) .p. busch , t. heinonen and p. lahti , _ phys .rep . _ * 452 * , 155 ( 2007 ) .r. f. werner , _ q. inf .comp . _ * 4 * , 546 ( 2004 ) .e. andersson , s. m. barnett and a. aspect , _ phys .a _ * 72 * , 042104 ( 2005 ) .p. busch and t. heinosaari , _comp . _ * 8 * , 0797 ( 2008 ) .p. stano , d. reitzner and t. heinosaari , _ phys .a _ * 78 * , 012315 ( 2008 ) .p. busch and h. j. schmidt , _ q. inf . process ._ * 9 * , 143 ( 2010 ) .s. yu , n. liu , l. li and c. h. oh , `` joint measurement of two unsharp observables of a qubit '' , _ e  print arxiv_:0805.1538v1 .d. m. appleby , _ int .. phys _ * 37 * , 2557 ( 1998 ) .d. m. appleby , _ int .phys _ * 39 * , 2231 ( 2000 ) .g. m. dariano , p. lo presti and m. f. sacchi , _ phys .a _ * 292 * , 233 ( 2002 ) .p. kienzler , _ int .. phys _ * 37 * , 1 ( 1998 ) .p. busch and f. e. schroek ( jr . ) , _ found .* 19 * , 7 ( 1989 ) .t. brougham and e. andersson , _ phys .a _ * 76 * , 052313 ( 2007 ) .p. busch , _ phys .d _ * 33 * , 8 ( 1986 ) .y. s. kupitz and h. martini , _ j. of geometry _* 49 * , 150 ( 1994 ) .w. son , e. andersson , s. m. barnett and m. s. kim , _ phys . rev . a _ * 72 * , 052116 ( 2005 ) . t. brougham , e. andersson and s. m. barnett _ phys. rev . a _ * 73 * , 062319 ( 2006 ) . g. m. dariano , c. macchiavello and m. f. sacchi ,_ j. optics b _ * 3 * , 44 ( 2001 ) .p. j. lahti , _ int .. phys _ * 42 * , 5 ( 2003 ) . w. h. press and g.r .farrar , _ computers in phys ._ , * 4 * , 190 ( 1990 ) .
