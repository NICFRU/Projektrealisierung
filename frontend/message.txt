a standing sound wave in a tube with an open end has an antinode bit outside the end point .such a small distance is called the open end correction ( hereafter abbreviated as oec ) .the end correction @xmath0 was calculated for an infinite flanged circular tube by rayleigh @xcite , and after that , h. levine and j. schwinger calculated the unflanged end correction as a function of wavelength @xcite .oec for an infinite flanged circular tube as a function of wavelength was determined by y. nomura et al . by the radiation impedance method @xcite .the recent application of oec was given by m. s. howe @xcite ( and related references therein ) .the idea of obtaining oec as discussed by rayleigh comes from the fluid mechanical consideration @xcite , @xcite .let us suppose a half infinite space with a connected circular tube filled with nonrotational and noncompressive fluid , and assume a piston moving at a speed of @xmath1 in the tube as seen in fig .then , the total kinetic energy of the fluid is given by the definition of oec .@xmath2    where @xmath3 is the fluid mass density , @xmath4 is the velocity potential , @xmath5 is the cross - sectional area of the tube , and @xmath0 is the oec . the integration region is taken toward the piston inner circular tube and half infinite 3d space .the region with a nonzero velocity is not only in the tube but is also spread around a branching bay with a speed lower than @xmath1 .such a region contributes to oec .    in this study, we calculate oec quite differently . as shown in fig .2 , we place a circular well at @xmath6 with a radius @xmath7 and a depth @xmath8 , and consider the particle diffusion of density @xmath9 .we put a particle bath with a density @xmath10 at the bottom of the well ; we thus have @xmath11 at infinity . by using the above boundary conditions, we approximately solve the static diffusion equation under the condition that one - dimensional diffusion is occurring in the well . by using a solution for a diffusion field , we define oec and show that its value is @xmath12 , consistent with that given by rayleigh and nomura et al ., when the tube radius is small enough compared with the wavelength @xmath13 @xcite .in the well , we approximate the diffusion process by using a one - dimensional diffusion equation ( see fig .this is very simple , but is essential for our further discussion . at the top of the well , the space is widely opening and it is therefore possible to suppose that @xmath14. then , the constant diffusion flow comes up from the bottom . @xmath15our purpose is to correct this flow formula .+ we take @xmath16 and then obtain the diffusion field and constant diffusion flow .@xmath17 @xmath18 is the number of particles supplied per unit time from the well to the open region while leaving @xmath19 undetermined .then , we solve the diffusion equation in open space with the boundary conditions    @xmath20    @xmath21    the additional condition @xmath22 is given below using the solution of the diffusion equation in an open region .then , two diffusion fields in the inner and outer wells are connected , and the diffusion equation is completely solved .we consider the diffusion equation @xmath23 in the open region @xmath24 .the boundary conditions are ( [ eq : bc1 ] ) and ( [ eq : bc2 ] ) .    .the particle server is at the bottom .particles diffuse from the bottom of the well into the outer region.,width=226 ]    by supposing an axial symmetry , we obtain the following static diffusion equation for the diffusion field @xmath25 :    @xmath26    then , we have a solution in the form    @xmath27    on the plane @xmath28 , the diffusion flow in the @xmath29 direction is given by    @xmath30    @xmath31 should be selected to obtain the boundary condition ( [ eq : bc2 ] ) .the following formula solves the problem .@xmath32    from ( [ eq : bc2 ] ) , ( [ eq : flow ] ) , and ( [ eq : formula ] ) , we determine the function @xmath31 given as @xmath33    then , we obtain the following solution for @xmath25 :    @xmath34    next , we must determine @xmath35 . from ( [ eq : density ] ) ,we obtain @xmath36    . at @xmath37, we have a nonzero density .this shows that particles diffused from the well and distributed around it .the square line shows the mean @xmath38.,width=264 ]    the function @xmath39 is expressed by the following hypergeometric function : @xmath40 the form of this function is given in fig .the smoothed curve is the function @xmath39 . to obtain a consistent solution with a diffusion field in the well , the matching condition ( [ eq : bc4 ] )is required at @xmath41 . however , as shown in figure 3 , the distribution at @xmath42 is not constant .this shows that our solution ( [ eq : density ] ) is not consistent with the inner - well solution , since our approximated solution ( [ eq : innerwell ] ) counts the diffusion out in the @xmath43-direction . to further achieve what in this approximation, we approximate the form of @xmath39 by its mean in the region @xmath42 .@xmath44    this mean is shown by a solid square line in fig .3 . then , an additional boundary condition ( [ eq : bc4 ] ) leads to @xmath45    from ( [ eq : innerwell ] ) and ( [ eq : boundary1 ] ) , we obtain    @xmath46    this result should be compared with the second equation of ( [ eq : innerwell_1 ] ) ; it shows that the effective depth of the well is slightly larger than @xmath8 and that oec is defined by    @xmath47    this is the same oec for sound in a long - wavelength limit @xcite .the point @xmath48 upwards of the well is the place where the density @xmath25 vanishes effectively .note that , from eq .( [ eq : boundary1 ] ) oec is defined by @xmath49 where @xmath50why do we have oec for sound in a long - wavelength limit by our method ?we discuss this point and show that the definition of oec by the radiation impedance method is quite similar to that given in this paper .first we review the radiation impedance method of obtaining oec .let us put a disk as a sound source oscillating in the @xmath51 direction and having a radius @xmath7 on the surface @xmath28 .the sound emitted from the source satisfies the wave equation ,    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the pressure field and @xmath54 is the speed of sound .the linearized euler equation is necessary to consider the speed of sound source : @xmath55 where @xmath3 is the mass density .    from the solution of eq .( [ eq : wave ] ) and ( [ eq : euler ] ) , we obtain the fluid velocity @xmath56 .the boundary conditions for @xmath53 at the surface @xmath28 are as follows :    @xmath57    where the time dependence is supposed to be @xmath58 .    from the emitted sound @xmath59, we obtain the force of reaction @xmath60 to the sound source as    @xmath61    then , the radiation impedance is defined by @xmath62 from the parallelism to the mechanical impedance , the additional inertial mass due to the radiation is defined using the maginary part of radiation impedance .@xmath63    this additional mass is supplied by oec as    @xmath64    so , we obtain oec by using the formula    @xmath65    where @xmath66    now , let us check the similarity of this oec in a diffusion process. the long - wavelength limit is given as    @xmath67    then eq . ( [ eq : wave ] ) leads to the laplace equation . the linearized euler equation ( [ eq : euler ] )should be compared with the equation of a diffusion flow .@xmath68    therefore , we have the correspondences ; @xmath69 and @xmath70 .the boundary condition ( [ eq : bc5 ] ) corresponds to @xmath71 which is the same as ( [ eq : bc2 ] ) .    the definition of oec as eq .( [ eq : oec4 ] ) corresponds to @xmath72 this is the same as the definition of oec for the diffusion equation ( [ eq : oec3 ] ) .therefore , the equations , boundary conditions , and definitions of oec are the same in the long - wavelength limit of these two methods .this is the reason why we can calculate oec of sound waves simply using a diffusion equation .the difficulty in obtaining oec is quite simplified in the long - wavelength limit by considering the diffusion equation .the authors would like to thanks prof.yokoyama in gakushuin university for the helpful suggestion .99        r. h. m. bosanquet , phil . mag . * 4 * , 216 ( 1877 ) ; d. j. blaikley , phil . mag . * 7 * , 339 ( 1879 ) ; w. m. boehm , phys . rev . *31 * , 341 ( 1910 ) ; a. e. bate , phil . mag . * 10 * , 617 ( 1930 ) ; * 24 * , 453 ( 1937 ) ; s. h. anderson and f. c. ostensen , phys31 * , 267 ( 1928 )
