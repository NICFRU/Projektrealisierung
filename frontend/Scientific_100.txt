the past few years witnessed a growing interest among particle physicists and cosmologists toward models with extra space - like dimensions .this interest was initiated by string theorists @xcite , who exploited a moderately large size of an external 11th dimension in order to reconcile the planck and string / gut scales .taking this idea further , it was shown that large extra dimensions allow for a reduction of the fundamental higher - dimensional gravitational scale down to the tev - scale @xcite .an essential ingredient of such a scenario is the confinement of the standard model fields on field theoretical defects , so that only gravity can access the large extra dimensions .these models are argued to make contact with an intricate phenomenology , with a variety of consequences for collider searches , low - energy precision measurements , rare decays and astroparticle physics and cosmology .however , the mechanisms , responsible for the stabilization of extra dimensions , remain unknown .the fact that the size of extra dimensions is large as compared to the fundamental scale also remains unexplained .an alternative solution to the hierarchy problem was proposed in ref .this higher dimensional scenario is based on a non - factorizable geometry which accounts for the ratio between the planck scale and weak scales without the need to introduce a large hierarchy between fundamental planck scale and the compactification scale .the model consists of a spacetime with a single @xmath0 orbifold extra dimension .three - branes with opposite tension reside at the orbifold fixed points , and together with a finely tuned negative bulk cosmological constant serve as sources for five - dimensional gravity .the resulting spacetime metric contains a redshift factor which depends exponentially on the radius of the compactified dimension . in the scenario presented in @xcite the distance between the branesis associated with the vacuum expectation value of a massless four dimensional scalar field .this modulus field has zero potential and consequently the distance is not determined by the dynamics of the model .for this scenario to be relevant , it is necessary to find a mechanism for generating a potential to stabilize the distance between the branes .classical stabilization forces due to the non - trivial background configurations of a scalar field along an extra dimension were first discussed by gell - mann and zwiebach @xcite . with the revived interest in extra dimensions and brane worlds , as modified version of this mechanism , which exploits a classical force due to a bulk scalar field with different interactions with the branes , received significant attention @xcite ( and references therein ) . however , as it was shown in refs .@xcite , a classical scalar interaction is not useful for the stabilization of two positive tension branes .another stabilization mechanism arises due to the casimir force generated by the quantum fluctuations about a constant background of a massless scalar field . for a conformally coupled scalar this effectwas initially studied in ref .@xcite in the context of m - theory , and subsequently in refs .@xcite for a background randall  sundrum geometry ( see also @xcite for the case of the de sitter bulk ) .recently a variant of the brane - world model with a compact hyperbolic manifold as a topologically non - trivial internal space is proposed @xcite . as it has been shown in refs .@xcite cosmology in such spaces has interesting consequences for the evolution of the early universe .the problem of radion stabilization in hyperbolic brane - world scenarios is considered in @xcite .    in the present paperwe will investigate the vacuum expectation values of the energy momentum tensor of the conformally coupled scalar field on background of the conformally flat brane - world geometries .we will consider the general plane symmetric solutions of the gravitational field equations and boundary conditions of the robin type on the branes .the latter includes the dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions as special cases .the casimir energy - momentum tensor for these geometries can be generated from the corresponding flat spacetime results by using the standard transformation formula .previously this method has been used in @xcite to derive the vacuum characteristics of the casimir configuration on background of the static domain wall geometry for a scalar field with dirichlet boundary condition on plates . for neumann or more general mixed boundary conditions we need to have the casimir energy - momentum tensor for the flat spacetime counterpart in the case of the robin boundary conditions with coefficients related to the metric components of the brane - world geometry and the boundary mass terms . the casimir effect for the general robin boundary conditions on background of the minkowski spacetimewas investigated in ref .@xcite for flat boundaries , and in @xcite for spherically and cylindrically symmetric boundaries in the case of a general conformal coupling .here we use the results of ref .@xcite to generate vacuum energy momentum tensor for the plane symmetric conformally flat backgrounds .the paper is organized as follows . in the next section the vacuum expectation values of the energy momentum tensor and vacuum forces acting on branes are evaluated for a general case of a conformally - flat plane symmetric background . in section [ sec : ads ] the important special case of the ads background is considered and the possibility for the stabilization of the distance ( radion field ) between the branes is discussed . finally , the results are re - mentioned and discussed in section [ sec : conclusion ] .in this paper we will consider a conformally coupled massless scalar field @xmath1 satisfying the equation @xmath2 on background of a @xmath3dimensional conformally flat plane  symmetric spacetime with the metric @xmath4 in eq .( [ fieldeq ] ) @xmath5 is the operator of the covariant derivative , and @xmath6 is the ricci scalar for the metric @xmath7 . note that for the metric tensor from eq .( [ metric ] ) one has @xmath8 ,   \label{riccisc}\ ] ] where the prime corresponds to the differentiation with respect to @xmath9 .we will assume that the field satisfies the mixed boundary condition @xmath10 on the hypersurfaces @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the normal to these surfaces , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 are constants .the results in the following will depend on the ratio of these coefficients only .however , to keep the transition to the dirichlet and neumann cases transparent we will use the form ( [ boundcond ] ) . for the case of plane boundaries under consideration introducing a new coordinate @xmath18 in accordance with @xmath19 conditions ( [ boundcond ] )take the form @xmath20 note that the dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions are obtained from eq .( [ boundcond ] ) as special cases corresponding to @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .our main interest in the present paper is to investigate the vacuum expectation values ( vev s ) of the energy momentum tensor for the field @xmath1 in the region @xmath23 .the presence of boundaries modifies the spectrum of the zero  point fluctuations compared to the case without boundaries .this results in the shift in the vev s of the physical quantities , such as vacuum energy density and stresses .this is the well known casimir effect .it can be shown that for a conformally coupled scalar by using field equation ( [ fieldeq ] ) the expression for the energy momentum tensor can be presented in the form@xmath24 \varphi ^{2 } ,   \label{emt1}\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the ricci tensor .the quantization of a scalar filed on background of metric ( 2 ) is standard .let @xmath26 be a complete set of orthonormalized positive and negative frequency solutions to the field equation ( [ fieldeq ] ) , obying boundary condition ( [ boundcond ] ) .by expanding the field operator over these eigenfunctions , using the standard commutation rules and the definition of the vacuum state for the vacuum expectation values of the energy - momentum tensor one obtains @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the amplitude for the corresponding vacuum state , and the bilinear form @xmath29 on the right is determined by the classical energy - momentum tensor ( [ emt1 ] ) . in the problem under considerationwe have a conformally trivial situation : conformally invariant field on background of the conformally flat spacetime . instead of evaluating eq .( [ emtvev1 ] ) directly on background of the curved metric , the vacuum expectation values can be obtained from the corresponding flat spacetime results for a scalar field @xmath30 by using the conformal properties of the problem under consideration . under the conformal transformation@xmath31 the @xmath30 field will change by the rule @xmath32 where for metric ( [ metric ] ) the conformal factor is given by @xmath33 .the boundary conditions for the field @xmath34 we will write in form similar to eq .( [ boundcond1 ] ) @xmath35 with constant robin coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath37 . comparing to the boundary conditions ( [ boundcond ] ) and taking into account transformation rule ( [ phicontr ] ) we obtain the following relations between the corresponding robin coefficients @xmath38 note that as dirichlet boundary conditions are conformally invariant the dirichlet scalar in the curved bulk corresponds to the dirichlet scalar in a flat spacetime . however , for the case of neumann scalar the flat spacetime counterpart is a robin scalar with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .the casimir effect with boundary conditions ( [ bounconflat ] ) on two parallel plates on background of the minkowski spacetime is investigated in ref .@xcite for a scalar field with a general conformal coupling parameter . in the case of a conformally coupled scalarthe corresponding regularized vev s for the energy - momentum tensor are uniform in the region between the plates and have the form @xmath41 \rangle _ { { \rm ren}}=-\frac{j_d(b_1,b_2)}{2^{d}\pi ^{d/2}a^{d+1}\gamma ( d/2 + 1)}{\rm diag}(1,1,\ldots , 1,-d ) , \quad z_{1 } < z < z_{2 } , \label{emtvevflat}\ ] ] where @xmath42 and we use the notations @xmath43 for the dirichlet and neumann scalars @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively , and one has @xmath46 with the riemann zeta function @xmath47 .note that in the regions @xmath48 and @xmath49 the casimir densities vanish @xcite : @xmath41 \rangle _ { { \rm ren}}=0,\quad z < z_{1},z > z_{2}.   \label{emtvevflat2}\ ] ] this can be also obtained directly from eq .( [ emtvevflat ] ) taking the limits @xmath50 or @xmath51 .the values of the coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath53 for which the denominator in the subintegrand of eq .( [ emtvevflat ] ) has zeros are specified in @xcite .in particular , this denominator has no zeros for @xmath54 . in fig .[ fig1id ] the function @xmath55 is plotted versus @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 .the vacuum energy -

[ cols=""^,^,^ "" , ]     now we turn to the brane  world model introduced by randall and sundrum @xcite and based on the ads geometry with one extra dimension . the fifth dimension @xmath18 is compactified on an orbifold , @xmath0 of length @xmath87 , with @xmath100 .the orbifold fixed points at @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the locations of two 3-branes . for the conformal factor in this model one has @xmath103 .the boundary conditions for the corresponding conformally coupled bulk scalars have the form ( [ boundcond1 ] ) with robin coefficients @xmath104 , where the constants @xmath105 are the coefficients in the boundary mass term @xcite : @xmath106 .\ ] ] note that here we consider the general case when the boundary masses are different for different branes .supersymmetry requires @xmath107 .the boundary induced part of the vev s for the energy - momentum tensor on the randall - sundrum brane - world background are obtained from eq .( [ bpartemtads ] ) with additional factor 1/2 .this factor is related to the fact that now in the normalization condition for the eigenfunctions the integration goes over the region @xmath108 , instead of @xmath109 .the expressions for the total energy and vacuum forces remain the same .the coefficients @xmath83 in the expression for @xmath55 are given by the formula ( below we will keep @xmath110 general ) @xmath111 in the randall - sundrum model , the hierarchy problem is solved if @xmath112 . for these values of distances between the branesone has @xmath113 under the assumption @xmath114 .expression ( [ totenrs ] ) takes into account the casimir energy of the bulk . in general , the total vacuum energy receives additional contribution coming from the vacuum energy located on branes . in the case of general mixed boundary conditions the decomposition of the vacuum energy into surface and volume parts is presented in ref .@xcite for the minkowski background .the corresponding results for a conformally coupled scalar on the ads bulk is obtained by a way similar to that described above . for the total vacuum energy per unithypersurface on the brane @xmath65 this yields @xmath115 .\ ] ] in addition , the vacuum energy per unit hypersurface on the brane @xmath65 can contain terms in the form @xmath116 with constants @xmath117 and @xmath118 and corresponding to the single brane contributions when the second brane is absent .adding these terms to the vacuum energy corresponds to finite renormalization of the tension on both branes ( see @xcite for more detailed discussion ) .in the present paper we have investigated the casimir effect for a conformally coupled scalar field confined in the region between two parallel branes on background of the conformally - flat plane symmetric spacetimes .the general case of the mixed boundary conditions is considered .the vacuum expectation values of the energy - momentum tensor are derived from the corresponding flat spacetime results by using the conformal properties of the problem .the purely gravitational part arises due to the trace anomaly and is zero for odd spacetime dimensions . in the region between the branesthe boundary induced part for the vacuum energy - momentum tensor is given by formula ( [ bpartemt ] ) , and the corresponding vacuum forces acting per unit surface of the brane have the form eq .( [ vacforce ] ) .these forces vanish at the zeros of the function @xmath55 . in the case@xmath119 the subintegrand in eq .( [ vacforce ] ) has no real poles and the location of these zeros for @xmath58 is plotted in fig .[ fig2zer ] .further we consider a special case of the ads bulk with the brane induced vacuum energy - momentum tensor given by eq .( [ bpartemt ] ) . on a specific examplewe demonstrate that there are stable equilibrium points , where the vacuum forces vanish and the radion field is stabilized .an application to the randall - sundrum brane - world model is discussed . in this modelthe coefficients in the robin boundary conditions on branes are related to the boundary mass terms for the scalar field under consideration . in the present paperwe have considered the geometry of flat branes .the corresponding results for spherical branes can be obtained by applying the same method of conformal transformation to the corresponding flat spacetime vacuum energy - momentum tensor given in @xcite ( for the total casimir energy in the cases of spherical one and two brane configurations see refs .we acknowledge support from the research project of the kurdistan university . the work of aas was supported in part by the armenian ministry of education and science ( grant no .0887 ) .n. arkani - hamed , s. dimopoulos , and g. dvali , phys . lett . *b429 * , 263 ( 1998 ) ;
