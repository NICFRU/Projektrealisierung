0.66,0.76,50.43478260869565,"King Louis The Eleventh was a merry fellow, loving a good joke. He lived jovially, giving chase to soiled doves as often as to hares. He did not go in for waste and extravagance, always put his hand upon the solid. Certain devourers of the people found no crumbs at his table, they have all maligned him. It was he who said when he was in a merry mood, that four things are excellent and opportune in life--to keep warm, to drink cool, to stand up hard, and to swallow soft.. Louis XI. had given the Abbey of Turpenay (mentioned in 'Imperia') to a gentleman who, enjoying the revenue, had called himself Monsieur deTurpenay. This is the circumstance related by the said Verville, and I suspect he was cracking a joke. I reproduce it because certain people are not familiar with the exquisite work of my perfect compatriot. I abridge it and only give the substance, the details being more ample, of which facts the savans are not ignorant. I have only seen in our friend Verville that this worthy sovereign ever made a mistake; but one does not make. The real abbot, who was a monk, came and presented himself before the king, and presented also a petition. Tristan, taking a frock for a monks, accosted him and led him to one side, and taking him by the button-hole gave him to understand that the king desired he should die. The king was at Plessis-les-Tours, and the king promised to render him contented. This monk, importunate as are all hooded animals, came often at the end of the king's meals, who, bored with the holy water of the convent, called friend Tristan and said. The king strangled Turpenay between the head and shoulders, so that he expired. Tristan was present: the king called him, and whispered into his ear--""You have not done that which I told you to"" The monk approached. The king said to him, ""Kneel down!"" The poor monk began to shiver in his shoes. The monk said to the king, ""Saving your Grace I have done it. Turpeny is dead."". The king said to him, ""Thank God that he has not willed that you should be killed as I had ordered. God has done you justice. Go and pray God for me, and don't stir out of your convent."" The monk might very well have hanged the monk, the cause of the error. As for the said gentleman, he died in the king's service. He was the husband of Nicole Beaupertuys, wife of a citizen of the town. The husband he sent into Ponent, and put the said Nicole in a house near Chardonneret, in that part which is the Rue Quincangrog. Nicole had a tongue as sharp as a popinjay's, was of stately proportions, furnished with large beautiful cushions of nature, firm to the touch, white as the wings of an angel. She was as gay as a lark, always laughing and singing, and never made anyone miserable. The king often went with the hail-fellows his friends to the lady's house, and in order not to be seen always went at night-time, and without his suite. The husband and the wife were thus both in his service, and he had by La Beaupertuys a daughter, who died a nun.. The king gave to Nicole all the most savage dogs he had in his kennels, beggars that would eat a man without saying ""By your leave"" When the Sire came Nicole let them loose in the garden, and the door of the house being sufficiently barred and closely shut, the king put the keys in his pocket. In perfect security gave himself up, with his satellites, to every kind of pleasure, fearing no betrayal, jumping about at will, playing tricks, and getting up good games. People of Tours were there for these little amusements, to whom he gently recommended silence, so that no one knew of these pastimes until after his death. The king's pass would have been easy to give the passers-by a benediction with his. The farce of ""Baisez mon cul"" was, it is said, invented by the said Sire. I will relate it, although it is not the subject of this tale, because it shows the natural comicality and humour of this merry monarch. They were at Tours three well known misers: the first was Master Cornelius, who is sufficiently well known; the second was called Peccard, and sold the gilt-work, coloured papers, and jewels used in churches. The third was hight Marchandeau, and was a very wealthy vine-grower.. ""Go,"" said he, ""seek my treasurer, and let him bring hither six thousand gold crowns--and at once! And you will go and seize the bodies of my friend Cornelius, of the jeweller of the Rue de Cygnes, and of old Marchandeau, and bring them here, by order of the king"" ""Then he began to drink again, and to judiciously wrangle as to which was the better, a woman with a gamy odour or a. The cardinal asked which was the most precious thing to a lady; the first or the last kiss? To which La Beaupertuys replied: ""that it was the last, seeing that she knew then what she was losing, while at the first she did not know what she would gain."" During these sayings, and others which have most unfortunately been lost, came the six thousand gold crowns, which were worth all three hundred thousand francs of to-day. So much do we go on decreasing in value every day. The king ordered the crowns to be arranged upon a table, and well lighted up, so that they shone. The king gave Cornelius the chance to say 'Baisez mon cul' three times. Cornelius said he would pay ten crowns to Madame if he repeated the jest three times, and Cornelius did so. The king said Cornelius would soon be earned for his jest. The crowns were given to the king and his two guests, who looked at each other and smiled. The diamond of La Beaupertuys sparkled less than their little minnow eyes, said the king.. Cornelius' wife was determined to revenge herself upon Louis. She at least determined to pay out the said lords, to make fools of them, and amuse the king with the tricks she would play upon them. One evening that they had come to supper, she had a lady of the city with her, who wished to speak with the king. The two misers, distrustful of his Dutch gravity, replied, ""Certainly, sir,"" as if he had sneezed. The which caused all the company to laugh, and even Cornelius himself. When the vine-grower went to take the crowns he felt such a commotion in his cheeks that he could say nothing.. Nicole Beaupertuys led the king aside for a moment into an antechamber. She told him to make their guests drink hard and eat to repletion. But when the cloth was removed, he was to pick quarrels with them about trifles, dispute their words, and be sharp with them. She would then divert him by turning them inside out before him. But above all things, he had to be friendly to the said lady, and it was to appear as genuine, as if she enjoyed the perfume of his favour, because she had gallantly lent herself to this good joke. ""Well, gentlemen,"" said the king, re-entering the room, ""let us fall to. The king did not fail to distill into his guests this splendid and first-class supper. He stuffed them with green peas, returning to the hotch-potch, praising the plums, commending the fish, saying to one, ""Why do you not eat?"" to another, ""Drink to Madame"" ""How many words does it require to burst open the lid of your understanding?"" he asked. ""Do you understand? How many words do it require?"" he replied. ""I am not a man of words,"" he said. ""But I am a man who understands."". ""Drink, the king's eyes are the other way. Just give your opinion of these preserves, they are Madame's own. Have some of these grapes, they're my own growing"" ""This game is my own hunting; he who takes it not offends me."" ""Drink"" ""Have some medlars"" ""Drank"" ""drink"" 'drink' ""drank"" 'Drink' 'drank' 'Drank' ""Drunk"" 'dropped' 'drooped' 'dipped' 'spilled' 'dispensed' ' drained' and 'disposed' of food.. The king was the first to give vent to a loud sounding belch. The other guests determined to get rid of the vapours which were dodging about in their pancreatic retorts. Some of them puffed and swelled like tax-gatherers. The king heard this gastric language and asked himself, ""What does this mean?"" He then asked, ""Am I a simple clerk?"" and began to belch again. The rest of the guests were able to get the vapour out of their bodies. The story was told by the king's son-in-law, who later became a cardinal.. Beaupertuys took the good king aside and said to him -- ""Know now that I have had made by the Church jeweller Peccard, two large dolls, exactly resembling this lady and myself"" The king, singling out the cardinal, made him get up, and talked with him seriously of his affairs, holding him by the tassel of his amice. And after an honest lapse of water, BeaupertUys came back alone, leaving it to be believed that she had left the lady at the little laboratory of natural alchemy.. The king asked La Balue if he would slip out of the room, since the water was in his cellars, and he was about to lose the key of his back-door. To all that the king said, La Balues replied, ""Yes, sir,"" to be delivered from this favour. Nothing is so ignorant, so insolent as those cursed objects, and they are importunate like all things detained to whom one owes liberty. So they slipped at every turn like eels out of a net, and each one had need of great efforts and science not to disgrace himself before the king.. The cardinal believing that the lady had obtained her receipt from the bank of deposit, left the tassels of his girdle in the king's hand. The counsellor of justice said to Oliver, ""I would give my office to be behind a hedge for half a dozen seconds"" ""Oh, there is no enjoyment to equal a good stool,"" replied the surgeon. ""Now I am no longer astonished at sempiternal droppings of a fly,"" replied Oliver. ""What is the matter with you, Monsieur le Cardinal?"" said the king. ""It appears that all your affairs are very extensive, sire!"". The cardinal returned to the room shivering. The others imagined that he had emptied his natural reservoirs, unburdened his ecclesiastical bowels, and believed him happy. However, on the last steps the barking of the dogs put him in great fear of being bitten in one of his precious hemispheres. He came back burdened with an accumulation which seriously impeded his private channels. He was compelled, like La Balue, to murmur words of excuse to this student of perpetual motion, shutting the door with as promptitude as he opened it.. Louis the Eleventh was in a state of distress when his wife was taken ill. The courtiers were unable to unburden themselves of their sauces. Louis was so distressed that he asked the surgeon to give his wife more time. The surgeon said that the lady would not be able to go on until the next day. Louis said that his wife had been working for an hour at a time to cure her of her colic. The doctor said that he could not do more than one more hour of work on the woman. Louis then asked the doctor to give the woman more time to recover.. The king laughed to himself with Nicole, who aided him to stop the respiration of these loose-bowelled gentlemen. You can believe they found her beautiful and graceful, and would willingly have kissed her. The good Scotch captain, who more than all the others had eaten of a dish in which the cook had put an aperient powder, became the victim of misplaced confidence. He went ashamed into a corner, hoping that before the king, his mishap might escape detection. At this moment the cardinal returned horribly upset, because he had found La Beaupertu. ""Sire,"" said La Balue, insolently, ""the affairs of purgatory are in my ministry, and I am bound to inform you that there is sorcery going on in this house"" ""Ah! little priest, you wish to make game of me!"" said the king. ""Ho, there! Tristan, my friend!"" cried Louis XI. ""Oh!"" on beholding her near his master.. ""Conduct these gentleman to the Pretorium, on the Mall, my friend, they have disgraced themselves through over-eating,"" said the king. ""The farce is good, but it is fetid,"" replied he, laughing. ""Am I not good at jokes?"" said Nicole to him. ""Come up here!"" said the monarch. from the window, which he threw up suddenly, ""come up there!"" ""The king was partial to these dirty tricks,"" said Tristan. ""He was not at all a bad fellow, as the guests remarked while relieving themselves,"" said Nicole.. The king played a good joke on La Godegrand, an old maid. The citizens of Tours had never failed to defile the Mall of Chardonneret, because the gentlemen of the court had been there. The king had caused to be hanged a young citizen of Tours, who had violated a noble lady of a certain age, believing that she was a young maiden. He was amused by the antics of the old girl, who did not know she was so much within the range of his majesty's culverin. He had also killed a young man who had defiled a noble woman, and had hanged him. He also killed another man who defiled another noble lady, and killed him.. A young man had long hair, and was so handsome that the whole town wished to see him hanged, both from regret and out of curiosity. He had taken it into his head to rob her of a splendid silver goblet, in payment of the present he had just made her. The said young man swung very well; and after the fashion and custom of persons hanged, he died gallantly with his lance couched. Many ladies said on this subject that it was a murder not to have preserved so fine a fellow from the scaffold. ""Suppose we were to put this handsome corpse in the bed of La Godegrand,"" said La Beaupertuys to the king. ""We. The king sent to have the young townsman, who had just finished the last scene of his tragic farce, taken down. Two officers got over the walls of La Godegrand's garden, and put the corpse into her bed, on the side nearest the street. Be sure that she will welcome even a dead man, so madly does she long for a living one. Yesterday I saw her making love to a young man's cap placed on the top of a chair, and you would have laughed heartily at her words and gestures."" The king remained in the room with the balcony to it, playing with Beaupertuys.. ""Ah!"" the corpse said to her, 'God bless you!'"" At this joke of luck of La Beaupertuys, both laughed heartily in their sleeves. And with great attention this very Christian king watched the undressing of the old maid, who admired herself while removing her things. ""Without these little faults of nature, they would be too proud, and one would not be able to enjoy their society,"" said the king. ""Ah!"" said the corpse. ""God blessYou!"" said La Beauertuys. ""And with great. attention thisvery Christian king watching the undressed of the. old maid,"" said King Louis.. The story of a woman who tried to reanimate a hanged man. The story is told in the play The Hanged Man by the French playwright Jean-Michel Basquiat. La Beaupertuys, the king of France, heard the story and asked his son what was going on. The king's son replied that the woman had been trying to revive the man. She had been attempting to perform scientific experiments in the interests of hanged persons. The play is said to have been written by the playwright's son, Jean-Baptiste.. ""It is a work of Christian humanity."" ""The old girl rubbed and warmed this fine young man"" ""She put her hand upon the man's heart, and felt it beat feebly"" ""It is the work of a Christian humanity. It is the will. ""See how my executioners serve me!"" said Louis, laughing. ""Ah!"" said La Beaupertuys, ""you will not have him hanged again? he is too handsome"" ""The decree does not say that he shall be hanged twice, but he shall marry the old woman."" ""I will marry you, my lord!"" said the old lady, ""and you will marry me!"" ""Yes, my good lady,"" said the young man, ""I'll marry you."" ""Yes,"" said his mother, ""but only if you marry me."" ""No, my dear, not if I marry you!"" said his father.. The young man moved and came more to life; then he fell, from natural causes, into a state of great weakness and profound sadness, prostration of flesh and general flabbiness. Now the old maid, who was all eyes, and followed the great and notable changes which were taking place in the person of this badly hanged man, pulled the surgeon by the sleeve, and pointed out to him, by a curious glance of the eye, the piteous cause. The king kept his word, and married them. As La Godegrand had a very big basket of crowns, they founded a good family in Touraine."

The said abbey by this means became fertile in proverbs, which none of the clever folks of our day understand. To return to these good recluses, it was said--by way of a joke, of course--that they preferred finding a harlot in their. The key of the Abbey of Poissy was the gate of the said abbey. This gate, door, wicket, opening, or road was always half open. It was easier to open than to shut, and cost much in repairs. The nuns of the. said Poissy were good young ladies, who now this way, now that, cheated God to the profit of the devil.. The Hours of Poissy was put together by a merry abbot of Turpenay for the diversion of his neighbours of Usee, Azay, Mongaugar, Sacchez, and other places of this province. The fantastic amours and the wild conduct of this woman, who was of royal blood, caused the convent of Poissie to become fashionable.. Mademoiselle, the king's daughter, their abbess, first called it faire la petite oie, to stick to the preliminaries of love. She gathered together in a body all those extra-judicial little pleasures of that sweet language, which come indeed from the lips, yet make. The court ladies of the court took lovers for la petite oie, others for honour, and at times also certain ones who had over them. When this virtuous princess was naked and shameless between the sheets, the said girls would steal noiselessly out of their cells, and hide. Among these figures sanctified to God there were fine ones, stout ones, lank ones, thin ones, plump ones, supple ones, shrunken ones, and figures of all kinds. At times they would measure their feet, to see whose were the smallest, compare the white plumpness of their arms, see whose nose had the infirmity of blushing after supper, count. ""They would swear eternal friendship, quarrel, sulk, dispute and make it up again"" ""Ah! you have lied to our mother; your nails are marked with white,"" said one to her neighbour. ""You must have a good many little sins to confess,"" said another. ""Suppose a gendarme came here one rainy day. ""Oh no!"" said she, ""I have been bitten by fleas."" ""Ha! you have fleas in your cell?"" ""Yes"" ""Do you know how the rules of our order enjoin them to be driven out. ""I can't find any,"" said the little novice, who was Mademoiselle de Fiennes. ""I smell no odour other than our own."" ""Yes,"" cried she. ""Yes, little one?"" ""Yes."". ""How did you see it?"" asked Sister Perpetue. ""I have two dark freckles, one on my shoulder and one onMy back, rather low down, but it is hidden in a fold of the flesh"". ""The flea?"" asked the novice. ""Certainly the flea,"" replied Sister Ovide. ""But in order to avoid the dangers of this chase, you must be careful in whatever spot you put your finger on the beast, to touch nothing else"" ""Ordinarily at the third ave the beast is taken,"" said the nun. ""You must take into consideration that it is one of God's creatures, and. ""If the flea be a male, if it be female, or if it is a virgin, verify three serious things"" ""These beasts have no morals, are all wild. ""How can one tell that a flea is a virgin? asked the curious novice. ""First of all,"" replied Sister Ovide, ""she is sad and melancholy, does not laugh like the others"" ""In that case,"" replied the novice, ""I have been bitten by a male"". The flea is a perverted creature. Expect to hear him howl, cough, spit, beg your pardon; to see him twist about, sweat, make sheep's eyes, and anything that may come into his head to put off this operation. But be not astonished; pluck up your courage. Then you will dextrously take the reins, the liver, the heart, the gizzard, and. "" fleas are often encountered who die from pleasure at being thus converted to our holy religion"" ""Ah! how lucky I am to have had nothing of that sort"" ""The Pope has at last been compelled to excommunicate this kind of love"" ""There are poor women who have scabs come upon their noses"". Sister Petronille only went twice a year to the bank of deposit. Sister Ovide had to remain enthroned until matins, saying, 'I am here by the will of God' Sister Ursula had to deliver the first verse, in order that she should not miss the office.. The late abbess would not allow that this was an especial favour, granted from on high, and said that God did not look so low. She lived in prayer alone, would remain in ecstasy before the altar of the virgin, and pretend so distinctly to hear the angels flying in Paradise, that she was able to hum the tunes they were singing.. Sister Petronille was so thin and dry that anyone knocking up against her would have drawn fire as from a flint. She had made a vow never to taste meat, either cooked or raw, and ate only a crust of bread a day. On great feast days she would add a morsel of salt fish, without any sauce, to her diet.. Sister Petronille's nature was so burning, that when water touched her, she went frist! like a hot coal. There are sisters who have accused her of secretly cooking eggs, in the night, between her toes, in order to support her austerities. But these were scandals, invented to tarnish this great sanctity of which all the other nunneries were jealous.. After Lent, and the fasts of the great jubilee, for the first time for eight months she had need to go to the little room, and to it she went. There, bravely lifting her dress, she put herself into a position to do that which we poor sinners do rather oftener. But. Ursula of Alexandria was a Catholic saint. She was known for her love of the poor. She died in 16th century. Her story is told in a book called ""The Last Supper"" by Ursula of Orleans. The book is about the last days of Ursula.. ""I cannot leave them without relating an adventure which took place in their house, when Reform was passing a sponge over it, and making them all saints"" ""The good man went about careless of the state of his cassocks, mantles, and breeches, so that the naked members of the church were covered. He was so charitable that he would have pawned himself to save an inf. The late Sieur de Poissy had left a daughter, without a sou or a rag, after having eaten, drunk, and gambled away her inheritance. This poor young lady lived in a hovel, without fire in winter or cherries in spring; and did needlework, not wishing either. The archbishop gave to one of his servants, the oldest of his nether garments, which was sorely in need of stitches. Saintot took the breeches and went his way towards Poissy, stopping to chat with friends he met on the way. He told the abbess that his master had sent him to give her these articles. The abbess told the sisters of the precious message of the good archbishop. When they undid the breeches, which gaped horribly, they shrieked out, covering their eyes with one hand, in great fear of seeing the devil come out. ""Hide yourselves my daughters! This is the abode of mortal sin!"" said the abBess.. ""It's fifteen years, dear mother, since I have been permitted to gaze upon the demon's den."" ""Silence, my daughter"" ""What is there at the bottom of this? With what idea has our father. The abbess sewed the archiepiscopal breeches as a mortification. She was occupied during ten days, praying, and sewing the said breeches, lining them with silk, and making double hems, well sewn, and in all humility. The convent should testify by a pretty souvenir to the said archbishop their delight that he thought of his daughters in. The prelate had had so much to attend to, that he had forgotten all about his garment. Then all of them, to the very youngest, had to do some work on these blessed breeches. The holy man drew such a picture of Mademoiselle de Poissy,. The wedding was celebrated at the archiepiscopal palace, where was a feast of the first quality and a table bordered with ladies of the highest lineage. Saintot said to the archbishop, ""Monseigneur, your well-beloved daughters of Poissy send you a fine. ""Well have they made the centre dish,"" said the bridegroom. ""These young ladies are of good understanding,"" he added. ""Therein are all the"

Plenty of things in real life are superlatively uninteresting; so that it is one-half of art to select from realities those which contain possibilities of poetry"" ""It is one of the great joys of poetry to be able to choose from realities that contain possibilities for poetry."" ""I have longed for a story which should drive two lovers together, as two children cling together at the sight of a snake by a woodside"" ""If you want to know why I wrote this, you can read it here."". We were talking of women and love. Our bashful fears, our silent interjections, our blushes, as we met each other's eyes, were expressive with an eloquence, a boyish charm, which I have ceased to feel. Oh! any poet who should have listened to our talk, for heaven knows how many stages beyond Montargis, would have reaped a harvest of flaming epithet, rapturous description, and very tender confidences. We still admired ""the woman of a certain age,"" that is to say, the woman between thirty-five and forty. We had not come thirty leagues before we were talking to each other of our lady-loves. We were in love with each other, and we were very fond of each other. But we were also in love, and it was not until later that we knew it.. ""We understood one another to admiration on all the essential points of passion,"" he writes. ""One must remain young, no doubt, to understand youth,"" he adds. ""This theory set no limits to the age of love, so we struck out, in all good faith, into a boundless sea"" ""We had portrayed our mistresses as young, charming, and devoted to us,"" he says. ""When we had endowed them with little feet, a satin, nay, a delicately fragrant skin, then came the admission that Madame Such-an-one was thirty-eight years old, and on mine that I worshiped a woman of forty"" ""I worshiped her, and she worshiped me, and we were in love,"" he continues.. One of us had traveled six hundred miles to see his mistress for an hour. The other, at the risk of being shot for a wolf, had prowled about her park to meet her one night. Out came all our follies in fact. We told each other everything, our perils, our great joys, our little pleasures, and even the humors of the situation. If it is pleasant to remember past dangers, is it not at least as pleasant to recall past delights? We live through the joy a second time.’’ ‘We were in the same confraternity of love. It was which of us should overtop the other in sentiment.” ‘I was in thesame confr fraternity of love,’ he said, ‘and it was which I should over top the other’.. ""It should not be difficult for you to imagine that my traveling companion was more than worthy of a countess,"" writes the author. ""Our countesses, moreover, were adored by their husbands; these gentlemen were enslaved by the charm possessed by every woman who loves"" ""Ah! how quickly the wind swept away our talk and our happy laughter!"" writes the writer. ""I scanned my new friend with much interest, and truly, it was not difficult to imagine him the hero of a very serious love affair"" ""It was not easy to imagine he was thehero of a love affair,"" adds the author, ""but he was not unbecoming"" ""He seemed to be very well informed, and was decidedly clever, and it should not have been difficult for me to imagine"" says the writer of the novel. ""He was as careful as a pretty woman should be,"". ""My luckless comrade, thinking to save himself, jumped to the edge of a newly-ploughed field, instead of following the fortunes of the vehicle and clinging tightly to the roof, as I did"" ""He either miscalculated in some way, or he slipped; how it happened, I do not know, but the coach fell over upon him, and he was crushed under it"" ""We carried him into a peasant's cottage, and there, amid the moans wrung from him by horrible sufferings, he contrived to give me a commission--a sacred task, in that it was laid upon me by a dying man's last wish"" ""Many a girl might have wished for such a husband, for he was a Vicomte with an income of twelve or fifteen thousand livres, ""to say nothing of expectations."" ""He bade me look for a key which he wore on a ribbon about his neck"". The coachman's death was the only fatal accident caused by the overturn. ""But it was partly his own fault,"" the coachman said to me. ""I executed the poor fellow's dying wishes,"" he added. ""It troubled him that he was powerless to utter a single word to thank me,"" he said. ""He looked wistfully at me for a moment, then his eyelids drooped in token of farewell, and his head sank, and he died"" ""His mother was away from home, which in a manner was fortunate for me,"" said the coachmen. ""His death was an accident, but it was an unfortunate one,"" said his coachman. ""You can't blame a man for a death if he doesn't deserve it,"" added the driver, ""and he didn't."". The Countess' chateau was some eight leagues beyond Moulins, and then there was some distance to walk across country. For divers reasons into which I need not enter, I had barely sufficient money to take me to Moulin. However, my youthful enthusiasm determined to hasten thither on foot as fast as possible. I asked for the shortest way, and hurried through the field paths of the Bourbonnais, bearing, as it were, a dead man on my back. I wished to be first at the Chateau. But I had another and more dreadful sorrow to think of, the sorrow of a woman who had lost her last love. So I left the old woman to her prosopopeia, and carried off the precious correspondence, carefully sealed by my friend of the day.. The nearer I came to the Chateau de Montpersan, the more aghast I felt at the idea of my strange self-imposed pilgrimage. Vast numbers of romantic fancies ran in my head. At every turn of a wood, in every beaten pathway, I rehearsed a modern version of the scene in which Sosie describes the battle to his lantern. I sketched out ingenious answers to the questions which she might be supposed to put to me. I imagined all. ""I had thought at first of nothing but the part that I was to play, of my own cleverness, of how I should demean myself,"" says the writer. ""But now that I had arrived, an ominous thought flashed through my soul like a thunderbolt tearing its way through a veil of gray cloud"" The writer's thoughts were full of her lover, who was looking forward hour by hour to a joy which no words can express. ""It was a cruel deed of charity to be the messenger of death!"" she writes. ""I was at a world of pains to invent plausible pretexts to draw him to her side. Yet, after all, it was a Cruel deed of Charity to be a Messenger of Death!"" she says. ""The Chateau of Montpersan stood out against the sky like a mass of brown cloud, with sharp. ""Many thanks,"" said I ironically. I might have spent a couple of hours in the park with her ""out there"" to guide me through. But I went in boldly, and in a moment found myself between two dogs, barking as your true country-bred animal can bark. The sound brought out a hurrying servant-maid, who said ""Madame is out there"" and pointed to the park. ""Many thanks"" said I. ""I might have stayed for a few hours with her"" and went in. But the dog barked again, and the servant- maid said, ""Madam is. ""Mother, here is a gentleman who wishes to speak to you!"" ""I must make a full confession,"" he said. ""I am not a man of letters,"" she replied. ""But I am a man who has a heart of gold,"" he added. ""And I have a heart for you,"" she said, ""and I have always had it in me."" ""I have always wanted to be your son,"" he replied. 'And I will be your husband,' she replied, ""if you will let me.'"" ""Yes,"" he agreed. ""Yes, I will."". ""I saw Juliette--Juliette and her husband. The pretty little girl held her mother by the hand. Thanks to this Gascon toilet, I could hope that the lady would not take me for the local rate collector"" ""I sometimes laugh at my own expense. I sought, but sought in vain, to remember any of the elegant phrases so laboriously prepared."" ""I was a total stranger, who bowed with a tolerably awkward air"" ""The lady's husband came forward and said, 'I am the husband of Mme. le Comte' "" ""I said to myself, 'The lady is not a lady, she is a woman' """"I was not a woman, but a woman,"" he said. ""I am a woman. I am not a man. I have no idea what to say to you."" ""You are a woman and I am a man"". The husband seemed to be a specimen of a certain type of nobleman, the fairest ornaments of the provinces of our day. He wore big shoes with stout soles to them. There was a touch of the magistrate in the man, a good deal more of the Councillor of the Prefecture, all the self-importance of the mayor of the arrondissement, the local autocrat, and the soured temper of the unsuccessful candidate who has never been returned since the year 1816. la Comtesse de Montpersan. was born in 1811. She was the daughter of the famous French poet, André de Montperran.. The Countess was a little woman, with a flat, graceful figure and enchanting shape. So fragile, so dainty was she, that you would have feared to break some bone if you so much as touched her. She wore a white muslin dress, a rose- colored sash, and rose-colored ribbons in the pretty cap on her head. Her chemisette was moulded so deliciously by her shoulders and the loveliest rounded contours, that the sight of her awakened an irresistible desire of possession in the depths of the heart. The Countess had a wizened, wrinkled, sunburned face, and long, sleek locks of scanty gray hair; as to character--an incredible mixture of homely sense and sheer silliness.. ""I have had so many battles to fight since those heedless days, that they have left me no time to distil all the least actions of daily life,"" he writes. ""I took a diplomatic course that would have done credit to an old ambassador"" ""I knew in what the special skill of courtiers and men of the world consists,"" he adds. ""M""M. ""For once, and perhaps for the only time in my life, I used tact, and knew inWhat the special skills of courtier and men. of the World consists"" ""M.""M ""I am a man of pleasure, and I would not have given her more than thirty years, her forehead was so girlish."" ""M."" ""I was a man, of pleasure. I would have given you more than 30 years, and you would. ""Monsieur. le Comte,"" I said with an air of mystery, ""I should like a few words with you,"" and I fell back a pace or two. ""My wife will be in despair,"" cried he; ""I shall be obliged to break the news of this unhappy event with great caution"" Juliette left us together, going away unconcernedly, like a wife who knew that she can learn her husband's secrets as soon as she chooses to know them. The effect produced by my news convinced me that his affection for his young collaborator was cordial enough, and this emboldened me to make reply as I did. I could not, without first informing you, deliver a message to Mme. la Comtesse, a message intrusted to me by an entire stranger.. ""From the high idea of your character which he gave me, I felt sure that you would not oppose me in the fulfilment of a dying request. Mme. la Comtesse will be at liberty to break the silence which is imposed upon me."" ""At this eulogy, the Count swung his head very amiably, responded with a tolerably involved compliment, and finally left me a free field. The bell rang, and I was invited to dinner. Not a little surprised to find her husband contriving some frivolous excuse for leaving us together, she stopped short, giving me a. ""There was all the disdain of the adored mistress, in whose eyes all men save one are as nothing,"" said the woman. ""I understood in her eyes, and all the pity and compassion in me made answer in a sad smile,"" he said. ""No doubt she had been scheming to enjoy full solitude for her love,"" he added, ""when, no doubt, she had was scheming for her own solitude"" ""This mute eloquence I understood,"" he continued, ""and all the compassion and pity in me replied in aSad smile"". ""Alas, madame, I have just made a very arduous journey----, undertaken solely on your account"" ""Is he ill?"" she asked, and her voice sank lower. ""Yes. But for pity's sake, control yourself. . . . He intrusted me with secrets that concern you"" ""How if he loved you no longer?"" she cried, and a faint smile, nothing less than frank, broke over her face. ""Oh! that is impossible!"" she cried. ""Never messenger could be more discreet nor more devoted than I"" ""You will not see him to-day."" ""I am sorry."" ""Yes, I am sorry"" ""I will come back to you soon."". ""Is he alive?"" she asked. ""Yes, madame,"" he replied. ""Is it true? Oh! tell me the truth; I can hear the truth."" ""Yes,"" he said. ""Any pain would be less keen than this suspense."" ""Is he dead?"" ""Yes. He is dead"" ""Yes!"" ""Yes! He is alive!"" ""Oh, my God!"" ""He is dead!"" ""No, he is not!"" ""Is that. The Count and Countess of Paris were visiting their daughter in Paris. The Count called the Countess to the dining- room, where he found her crying. She had fled out of sight, and the Count cried: ""Dinner is growing cold!"" The Count then called to the canon of Saint-Denis, who said grace, and then asked: ""Why, where can our dear Countess be?"" The Count answered: ""Have I a husband?"" and with those words she fled away.. The Count was helping himself to a slice of venison when a housemaid came in with, ""We cannot find madame anywhere, sir!"" The Count, for the sake of appearances, came as far as the threshold. ""Don't go, don't go!"" called he. But he did not offer to accompany us. We three--the canon, the housemaid, and I--hurried through the garden walks and over the bowling-green in the park, shouting, listening for an answer, growing more uneasy every moment. The Count did not go, but we all went, and we were all very glad to see him again. He was a kind man, but he was a very strange man.. The Countess was killed in a car accident. The maid took my secret dread far more seriously than the canon. We went along by the pools of water; all over the park we went. At last we turned back, and under the walls of some outbuildings I heard a smothered, wailing cry, so stifled that it was scarcely audible. The sound seemed to come from a place that might have been a granary. I went in at all risks, and there we found Juliette. She had buried herself deep in the hay, hiding her face in it to deaden those dreadful cries. She was sobbing and crying like a child, but there was a more poignant, more piteous sound in the sobs. There was nothing left in the world for her. She submitted with the supine listlessness of a dying animal.. The Countess was suffering from a sick headache. The maid could find nothing to say but ""There! madame; there, there----"" The old canon kept on exclaiming, ""What is the matter with her? What is it, niece?"" The Count was seated philosophically at table. He had eaten pretty nearly all the dinner, to the huge delight of his little daughter. The child was smiling at her father's flagrant infraction of the Countess' rules. The man's odd indifference was explained to me by a mild altercation which at once arose with the canon. The count was suffering with some serious complaint. The Countess had a headache. She had a fever. She was not to be disturbed, and that every one must be told that she was suffering.. The Countess' husband silently digested his dinner. The canon racked his brains to discover a reason for his niece's tears. The lady's husband sent through the maid, putting forward some feminine ailment as her excuse. The Countess could not utter a sound. She bent her head, and I withdrew. We all went early to bed. I cannot remember now what it was, but his medical advisers had put him on a very severe regimen, and the ferocious hunger familiar to convalescents, sheer animal appetite, had overpowered all human sensibilities. In that little space I had seen frank and undisguised human nature under two very different aspects, in such a sort that there was a certain grotesque element in the very midst of a most terrible tragedy.. ""Is it really true, monsieur, quite true?"" she asked. ""I do not know how I can live after that awful blow which struck me down a little while since"" ""What calm!"" I said to myself as I saw the ghastly pallor of her face contrasting with her brown hair, and heard the guttural tones of her voice. The havoc wrought in her drawn features filled me with dumb amazement. Those few hours had bleached her; she had lost a woman's last glow of autumn color. ""Just now I feel calm. I want to know everything."" ""I want to tell you everything"" ""I will tell you anything you want to hear"". I gave her the story of the accident in a few words, without laying too much stress on some too harrowing details. Her eyes were red and swollen, nothing of their beauty remained, nothing looked out of them save her bitter and exceeding grief. She listened eagerly, without shedding a tear, leaning her face towards me, as some zealous doctor might lean to watch any change in a patient's face. Then her tears were dried by the fires that burned in the dark depths within her. She grew even paler. She seemed to me to have opened her whole heart to pain, to be deliberately plunging herself into misery with the first delirious frenzy of despair. I caught at my opportunity, and told her of the fears that troubled the poor dying man. I told her how and why it was that he had given me this fatal message.. ""Madame----"" I began. ""I cut this from his head, this lock of his hair."" ""Ah! you love! May you be happy always"" ""Madame!"" she cried, ""I have nothing of him left!"" ""I burned all his letters!"" ""And I gave you his letters"" ""Ah, you love!"" she said, ""and I cut off this from your head, and this fromyour hair"" ""And you cut off that from my head, too!"" ""Ah!"" she exclaimed, ""And now you have both of them!"" ""Madam!"" I said. ""What do you want from me?"" ""I want his letters."". She broke off, and fled away with her treasure. The Comte de Montpersan came himself as far as Moulins with me. There he spoke with a kind of embarrassment: ""Monsieur, if it is not abusing your good-nature, and acting very inconsiderately towards a stranger to whom we are already under obligations"" May you never lose her whom you love. May you have the goodness, as you are going to Paris, to remit a sum of money to M. M. The next day, I spent several hours of it with the Juliette whom my poor comrade had so praised to me. In her lightest words, her gestures, in all that she did and said, I saw proofs of the nobleness of soul. I saw the delicacy of feeling which made her what she was.. ""Willingly,"" said I, ""I took charge of a rouleau of twenty-five louis d'or"" ""I owe him an amount, and he asked me to send it as soon as possible,"" said Juliette. ""Oh, my dear, not you! you must not die!"" said the woman who had helped me. ""I will never forget you,"" she said, ""and I will always love you"" ""And what rapture to have this adventure to tell to a woman who clung to you more closely in dread,"" said the writer. ""And I will remember you always,"" she replied. "" and I will never die!"""
0.64,0.74,53.200595459620395,"Louis Lambert was a French writer. He was a friend of the French Revolution. He wrote a book about the history of the revolution. He also wrote a novel, ""A Man Walks On The Earth"" (1793) The book was published in 1793. It was a bestseller and is considered one of the best-known works of all time. The book is called ""The Art of the Revolution"" and is published by Penguin Books. It is a collection of essays by Louis Lambert, published between 1793 and 1794.. Madame de Dey, widow of a lieutenant-general, left the court at the time of the emigration. She took refuge in Carentan, hoping that the influence of the Terror would be little felt there. The Revolution committed but few ravages in Lower Normandy. She now felt it advisable to open her house to the principle bourgeois of the town, and to the new governmental authorities. She wanted to make them pleased at obtaining her society, without arousing either hatred or jealousy. She had a good deal of property in the area. She was a woman of great means, and she wanted to help the people of the region. She felt that the Revolution would not affect her, and that she should help them.. The Duchess of Cambridge was a member of the French royal family. She was described as 'gifted by nature with that inexpressible charm which can please without having recourse to subserviency or to making overtures' The Duchess was married to Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Prince Philip and Prince William. The couple had three children, one son and two daughters. The Duchess died in a car crash in Paris in 1947.. Married in the flower of her age to an old and jealous soldier. Obliged to repress the naive impulses and emotions of a woman when she simply feels them instead of reflecting about them. Her manner and appearance commanded respect, but there was always in her bearing, in her voice, a sort of looking forward to some unknown future, as in girlhood. The most insensible man would find himself in love with her, and yet be restrained by a sort Of respectful fear, inspired by her courtly and polished manners. Her principal attraction came, in fact, from this innate youth, which sometimes, however, played her false, and gave to her ideas an innocent expression of desire.. The late Comte de Dey was the last surviving scion of his family. His mother was the sole heiress of her own. She loved him not only with the pure and deep devotion of a mother, but with the coquetry of a mistress, and the jealousy of a wife. She was miserable away from him, uneasy at his absence, could never see him enough, and loved only through him and for him. The happiness and pleasure of which her married life was deprived, she found in the passionate love she bore her son. The son was her last relation, the only being in the world to whom the fears and hopes and joys of her life could. Madame de Dey brought up her son with the utmost difficulty, and with infinite pains. A score of times the doctors had predicted his death, but, confident in her own presentiments, her own unfailing hope, she had the happiness of seeing him come safely through the perils of childhood. At twenty years of age, he was thought a most elegant cavalier at Versailles. Their souls understood each other with fraternal sympathy. If they had not been bound by nature's ties, they would instinctively have felt for each other that friendship of man to man, which is so rarely to be met in this life.. The mother of an emigre, who had to leave her son in the care of the French army, is said to have been afraid of her life. The mother of the emigres, who was a sub- lieutenant of the army, was said to be afraid of the dangers of her son's life. Her son was killed in a battle with the French Army in 1788. The daughter of the sub- Lieutenant, who died in the battle, was buried in the same place.. Madame de Dey had fully understood the difficulties that awaited her on coming to Carentan. To seek to occupy a leading position would be daily defiance to the scaffold; yet she pursued her even way. Sustained by her motherly courage, she won the affections of the poor by comforting indiscriminately all miseries. She made herself necessary to the rich by assisting their pleasures. She received the procureur of the commune, the mayor, the judge of the district court, the public prosecutor, and even the judges of the revolutionary tribunal. She took pleasure in believing that they had each chosen the wisest course, a course which would save to HIM both. The Countess of Dey was the most feared of her suitors. She employed the inventive wit and slyness which Nature grants to women in opposing the four rivals one against the other. By thus gaining time, she hoped to come safe and sound to the end of the national troubles. At this period, the royalists in the interior of France expected day by day that the Revolution would be ended on the morrow. The countess's husband was a public prosecutor, previously an attorney at Caen, and the manager of the countess’s affairs. He alone knew the exact condition of the property of his former client.. Madame de Dey closed her doors to her usual evening visitors. The people who called upon her expressed extreme anxiety. They inquired what misfortune, grief, or illness afflicted her. In reply, an old housekeeper told them that her mistress had shut herself up in her room and would see no one, not even the servants. This conviction was the ruin of very many of them. The first Inquisitive said, ""If she were ill, she would have sent for the doctor"" But the doctor has been all day long playing chess with me, he said. The second Inquisitive replied, ""She would have been ill, too, if the doctor had been with her"". The town of Brigitte was in a state of conjecture. The town knew that Madame de Dey did not like game. The hare became, therefore, the point of departure for a vast array of suspicions. The foot- man was beating a carpet in the garden. The carpet now became a corner-stone on which the whole town built up its theories. The old men who were taking their walks abroad, remarked a sort of concentrated activity about Madame deDey's premises. The servants took the very precautions which the servants took to conceal it. The women were the first to learn that Brigitte had made larger purchases than usual in the market.. The mayor of Carentan was convinced that a priest who refused the oath had arrived from La Vendee and asked for asylum. Others were convinced that the person thus harbored was a noble escaped from the Paris prisons. The judge of the district court held firmly to the theory of a Chouan leader or a body of Vendeans pursued the priest. The mayor's brother, an old married merchant, was also convinced that it was the priest who had come to seek asylum in the city. The priest's brother was also certain that the priest had come from La  Vendee. The townspeople were in a state of panic, but the mayor was able to calm them. The countess was accused of being guilty of one of those generosities, which the laws of the day called crimes, and punished on the scaffold. The public prosecutor remarked in a low voice that it would be best to say no more, but to do their best to save the poor woman from the abyss toward which she was hurrying. ""If you talk about this affair,"" he said, ""I shall be obliged to take notice of it, and search her house. The old merchant went himself in the morning to Madame de Dey's house. He insisted on seeing her, and was amazed to find her in the garden gathering flowers for her vases. The old man told the countess of the rumors that were floating about the town, and the dangers to which she was exposing herself. ""For,"" he said in conclusion, ""though some of the authorities will readily pardon a heroism which protects a priest, none of them will spare you if they discover that you are sacrificing yourself to the interests of your heart"" The countess looked at the old man with a wild and bewildered air, that made him shudder.. The old man now understood both the hopes and the fears of the poor woman. The letter was from her son. He had returned to France to share in Granville's expedition, and was taken prisoner. He did not doubt his means of escape, and he named to her three days, on one of which he expected to be with her in disguise. She quivered. For the first time in that little town, her soul sympathized with that of another. She said in an altered voice, and very softly, -- ""I trust you"". The letter contained his last wishes and a sad farewell. The merchant made visits on various pretexts to the principal families of Carentan. Matching his own craft against those wily Norman minds, he replied to the questions put to him on the nature of Madame de Dey's illness in a manner that hoodwinked the community. The old man replied that he would see his brother the mayor. The letter was returned to the countess, who was worried about Brigitte's health. The countess feared that if Brigitte did not reach Carentans by the third day, she might know some fatal difficulty.  Madame de Dey had almost died of a sudden attack of gout in the stomach, but had been relieved by a remedy which the famous doctor, Tronchin, had once recommended to her. She applied the skin of a. The countess of Carentan, a royalist ""in petto,"" was a recluse. She kept herself secluded in her salon. She used country furniture, burned tallow candles, and followed the customs of the town. The doctor of the city, a Royalist, suggested a remedy for her seclusion. The remedy was successful, but suspicions remained in the minds of some people. The countess was eventually found to be a woman of some repute, and her secret was revealed to the world. She was later married to the Prince of Wales.. The countess gave her guests excellent dinners. She hid her emotions by starting topics relating to the interests of the town. She raised such a lively discussion on the quality of ciders that the company almost forgot to watch her. The public prosecutor and one of the judges of the revolutionary tribunal was taciturn. Every now and then they addressed her some embarrassing question, to which the countess answered with admirable presence of mind. The countess's countenance was quite natural, and her composure imperturbable. She was sustained in her part by the sympathizing glances of the old merchant. She gave them nothing which conduced to their personal enjoyment.. After Madame de Dey had arranged the card parties, placing some guests at the boston, and some at the whist tables, she stood talking to a number of young people with extreme ease and liveliness of manner. Presently she suggested a game of loto, and offered to find the box, on the ground that she alone knew where it was, and then she disappeared. ""He does not come,"" she moaned, looking round the room prepared for her son. ""Here alone I can breathe, I can live! A few minutes more and he MUST be here; for I know he is living. I am certain of it"". ""Brigitte!"" said the countess, in a heart-rending tone, placing a chair before the table. ""Ah! madame, he will come. He is not far off"" ""I haven't a doubt he is living, and on his way,"" replied Brigitte. ""He will come,"" replied the Countess, ""and I will be waiting for him"" ""He is not near,"" said Brigitte, ""but I will see him soon."" ""I will be there for him,"" said the Count. ""And I will hold him in. ""Is that a good sign?"" asked the countess. ""I put a key in the Bible, and I held it on my fingers while Cottin read a chapter in the gospel of Saint John; and, madame, the key never turned at all!"" ""Ah! if he would only come--no matter for his danger here,"" said Brigitte. ""Poor Monsieur Auguste!"" cried Brigitte, ""he must be. Madame de Dey re-entered her salon, affecting gaiety, and began to play loto with the young people. But after a while she complained of feeling ill, and returned to her chimney-corner. She smiled at Brigitte's husband, who was standing sentinel at the door, and whose eyes seemed stupefied by the intensity of his attention to the murmurs of the street and night. Such was the situation of affairs, and of people's minds in the house of Madame Dey, while along the road. The soldier was on his way to Carentan, where he was to meet a group of soldiers. He was carrying a boxwood stick, which he used to cut a path through the grass. The soldiers were on their way to a camp in the village of Lourdes, where they were to stay the night. The soldier was not the only one on the way, as the others were also heading to the camp, but they were not as far behind. The men were going to stay overnight, and the soldier was going to meet them in the morning. He had to make his way back to the village, but he was not too late, as. The young man was good-looking, and belonged, evidently, to a distinguished family. His air and manner were those of the nobility. He was summoned to the mayor's presence, where he found himself the object of minute observation. He asked for the billet he had asked for. Instead of receiving it at once, he was summoned.. The recruit was given a billet by the mayor of Carentan. He was told to go to the address of Madame de Dey's house. The mayor gave him a shrewd and meaning look. The intelligence of a good education was in the young man's face. The recruit was taken to the mayor's house and given his billet. The young man was taken back to his home in Paris. He later returned to France and joined the army.. ""He knows he hasn't far to go,"" thought the mayor as the recruit left the house. ""That's a bold fellow! God guide him! He seemed to have his answers ready"" The countess made a gesture of denial; but she had turned pale. ""Do not keep him under your roof later than seven o'clock in the morning,"" continued the functionary of the Revolution. ""You are, I cannot doubt, expecting your son."". ""I will prove,"" he continued in a kindly voice, ""the falsity of the denunciation, by making a careful search of the premises"" ""I will speak of your patriotic gifts, your civic virtues, and that will save you,"" he said. ""To-morrow, at eight, I shall be at your door with a den. A rap sounded on the door of Brigitte's flat. The prosecutor came in. The mother fell on her knees, begging for her son's life. ""If it costs us our life, we will save him,"" said the official. ""I will owe you only-- to yourself,"" he said. ""Oh!"" cried the mother. ""Madame, he has come"". Brigitte de Dey fell into the arms of her son, half dead. The recruit himself shuddered at the aspect of the countess. ""We expect a detachment to-night,"" said the recruit. ""Madame!"" said an unknown man. ""Ah! it is not he!"" she cried, recoiling in terror, and standing erect before the recruit, at whom she gazed with a haggard eye. ""Holy Father! what a likeness!"" said Brigitte.. ""Monsieur, I cannot stay with you longer. Allow my people to attend upon you,"" said Madame de Dey. ""They may guillotine me if I--"" ""I cannot stay here!"" cried Madame De Dey, ""I will go into the greenhouse; there I can hear what happens outside during the night"" The recruit made a noise in the room above by sitting down to his supper. ""Hush!"" said her husband in her ear, ""do you want to kill. The death of the countess had a far more solemn cause; it resulted, no doubt, from an awful vision. At the exact hour when Madame de Dey died at Carentan, her son was shot in the Morbihan. That tragic fact may be added to many recorded observations on sympathies that are known to ignore the laws of space. Records which men of solitude are collecting with far-seeing curiosity, and which will some day serve as the basis of a new science for which, up to the present time, a man of genius has been lacking. ""That was enough to kill her!"" cried Brigitte."
0.7,0.7999999999999999,59.303148213654055,"""A German friend of a Parisian banker was entertaining at dinner one of those friends whom men of business often make in the markets of the world through correspondence. This stranger laughed with simplicity, listened attentively, and drank remarkably well, seeming to like champagne as much perhaps as he liked his straw-colored Johannisburger. His name was Hermann, which is that of most Germans whom authors bring upon their scene. He was the type of the sons of that pure and noble Germany, so fertile in honorable natures, whose peaceful manners and morals have never been lost, even after seven invasions.. ""Monsieur Hermann"" is a story of a German banker who lost his fortune. The story was told by a woman who had read the novels of Hoffmann and Scott. The author says the story is about a man who loses his fortune and his wife. He says the man's wife was killed in a car crash. The woman was killed by a car bomb. The writer says the woman's death was a tragic accident, and that the story was about the loss of her husband. He writes: ""I was not the one who lost my fortune, but my wife, who lost her husband."" The story is told in the book ""The Story of Hermann,"" by Hermann von Munchausen.. The Duchess of Malfi was the only daughter of the banker. She was a charming young creature whose education was then being finished at the Gymnase. She adored the plays of which she adored. At this moment the guests were in that happy state of laziness and silence which follows a delicious dinner. Leaning back in their chairs, their wrists lightly resting on the edge of the table, they were indolently playing with the gilded blades of their dessert- knives. These are little gastronomic felicities which Brillat-Savarin, otherwise so complete an author, overlooked in his book. The footmen had disappeared. The dessert was like a squadron after a battle: all the dishes were disabled, pillaged, damaged.. The German writer was at a dinner party in Switzerland. He was talking to guests about the melancholy of gastronomy. The guests were delighted to hear a German tale, even though it might prove of no interest. The voice of a narrator is always delightful to our languid senses, it increases their negative happiness, he says. The story was about a man who was sad during his digestion of a good dinner. The author's imagination was caught by the aspect of a guest who sat directly in front of him. He writes: ""I admired the faces about me, enlivened by smiles, beaming in the light of the wax candles, and somewhat flushed by our late good cheer"". ""I saw a man of medium height, rather fat and smiling, having the air and manner of a stock-broker, and apparently endowed with a very ordinary mind. Hitherto I had scarcely noticed him, but now his face, possibly darkened by a change in the lights, seemed to me to have altered its character. It had certainly grown ghastly; violet tones were spreading over it; you might have thought it the cadaverous head of a dying man. ""Is he ill?"" I said. ""Look!"" I said to my neighbor, pointing out to her the face of the unknown man, ""is that an embryo bankrupt?"" ""Oh, no!"" she answered, ""he would be much gayer."" Then, nodding her head gracefully, she added, ""If that man ever ruins himself I'll tell it in Pekin!"" He possesses a million in real estate. That's a former purveyor to the imperial armies; a good sort of man, and rather original. He married a second time by way of speculation. He has a pretty daughter, whom he refused for many years to recognize.. ""The death of his son threw the poor man into an agony of grief, which sometimes reappears on the surface"" ""I felt rather ashamed of wasting my powers of divination ""in anima vili,""--of a doltish financier"" ""It would be difficult to reproduce it in his own language, with his frequent interruptions and wordy digressions"" ""He was thinking of nothing. After all, that man, now beatified by gastronomical enjoyments, hadn't probably two ideas in his brain, and wasthinking of nothing"". The tale was written by a Nuremburger, but is now being translated by the author himself. The two travellers were Frenchmen, and were travelling on the Rhine. The French army, commanded by Augereau, was manoeuvring before the Austrians. The headquarters of the Republican division was at Coblentz, and one of the demi-brigades belonging to Augeaure's corps was stationed at Andernach. The tale was published in 1799, and the date corresponds to the end of the republican period.. The two young men were each provided with a pass and a commission as assistant-surgeon signed Coste and Bernadotte. At sight of their uniforms, blue mixed with white and faced with red velvet, their sabres, and above all their hats covered with a green varnished-cloth and adorned with a tricolor plume, even the German peasants had recognized army surgeons. Men of science, pacific yet useful, these young men did an actual good in the midst of so much misery, and formed a bond of sympathy with other men of science in the various countries through which the cruel civilization of the Republic passed. They were on their way to join the demi-brigade to which they were attached.. Two young surgeons, about twenty years of age at the most, yielded themselves up to the poesy of their situation with all the enthusiasm of youth. When a man's destiny is scientific he is, at their age, a being who is truly many-sided. Between Strasburg and Bonn they had visited the Electorate and the banks of the Rhine as artists, philosophers, and observers. They thought themselves rich in possessing a few louis, an actual treasure in those days when assignats were reaching their lowest depreciation and gold was worth more than silver.. The stay of the two friends at Bonn had the double purpose of science and pleasure. The grand hospital of the Gallo-Batavian army and of Augereau's division was established in the very palace of the Elector. The picturesque charm of the middle ages abounds, though in ruins. We are able to conceive the German genius, its reverie, its mysticism. The two young had therefore given themselves wholly to that deep admiration which must affect all educated men on seeing the banks of the Rhine and the scenery of Suabia. Louis XIV. and Turenne have cauterized that beautiful land. Here and there certain ruins bear witness to the pride or rather the foresight of the King of Vers. The two friends went to Andernach to see old comrades and to familiarize themselves with the first aspects of their profession. They were surprised by the grandiose effects of German architecture, and found everywhere new treasures both modern and antique. They also got rid of a few prejudices to which we cling so fondly in favor of the beauties of our native land. The two friends rode over the crest of some granite hill that was higher than the rest. Thence, through a clearing of the forest or cleft in the rocky barrier, they caught sudden glimpses. Two friends walked their horses in silence, as if no war were devastating this beautiful land. The valleys, the forest paths, the trees exhaled that autumnal odor which induced to reverie. Presently they descended by one of the declivities of the gorge, at the foot of which is placed the little town of Andernach, seated coquettishly on the banks of the river. The wooded summits were beginning to gild and to take on the warm brown tones significant of age. The leaves were falling, but the skies were still azure and the dry roads lay like yellow lines along the landscape, just then illuminated by the oblique rays of the setting sun.. Monsieur Hermann admired for a moment the pointed roofs with their projecting eaves, the wooden staircases, the galleries of a thousand peaceful dwellings, and the vessels swaying to the waves in the port. Then he admired for another moment Prosper Magnan. The two men were at a dinner party in Paris. Monsieur Hermann said he had forgotten the name of the other young man. The other man's name was Taillefer. The man appeared to feel ill, and his neighbor asked if he was ill..  Prosper Magnan was a young French surgeon. His companion was dark, rather thin, and jovial. They spent their last night of freedom at an inn. Painted entirely red, this inn produced a most piquant effect in the landscape. The inn produced an effect by detaching itself from the general background of the town, or by contrasting its scarlet sides with the verdure of the surrounding foliage, and the gray-blue tints of the water. The two young men reached Andernach the night was dark. Presuming that they would lose much time in looking for their chiefs and obtaining from them a military billet in a town already full of soldiers, they resolved to spend their last day of freedom in the inn.. The Red Inn is a building in Andernach, Germany. It was built in the 12th century. It is named after the Red Inn, a place of rest for sailors. The Red Inn was built on the site of a former inn. The building is now a hotel. It has a stable for horses and a guest house for guests. The stable is full of people. The guest room is full. The master of the inn has a room for you. If you want to sleep in a good bed I have only my own room to offer you. As for.  Prosper and his friend were thrown into the Red Inn in Bonn. The innkeeper told them they would have a princely meal of Rhine fish. Prosper said he had not eaten since morning. The two young men sat at a table in the public room of the inn. They noticed the stove, the clock, the pots of beer, the long pipes. They also noticed the eccentric physiognomies of Jews, or Germans, and the weather-beaten faces of mariners. They were thrown in by a company of smokers. The Red Inn is a German inn. It is located in the town of Bonn, in the province of Hesse.. The night of the Battle of the Rhine was the most famous of the First World War. The battle was fought between French and German troops. The Battle was fought over the control of the River Rhine, which is now known as the River Styx. It was the first battle of the Second World War, and the first to be fought in Europe. The conflict was won by the French, who defeated the Germans, who had been fighting in the Battle for several years. The war ended in 1815, but the battle was not fought over until the end of the war. It is thought that the battle may have been the first in the history of the world to have been fought over a single river.. Two Frenchmen and their landlord were listening with a sort of interest to the hoarse cries of sailors in a boat which appeared to be coming to the wharf. Doors and windows are opened and shut, voices murmur vague words, and a few interpellations echo along the passages. The innkeeper, familiar no doubt with the guttural shouts of the boatmen, went out hastily, but presently returned conducting a short stout man, behind whom walked two sailors carrying a heavy valise and several packages. ""Go and sleep in your boat,"" he said to the boat men, "". ""Monsieur,"" said the landlord to the new-comer, ""these are all the provisions I have left"" ""I haven't so much as another crust of bread nor a bone,"" he said. ""Not enough to put in my wife's thimble!"" said the Frenchman. ""You can have no bed but the chair on which you are sitting, and no other chamber than this public room"" ""Considering all things, that is best,"" replied the landlord, ""and I am sure you will find it."". The innkeeper's opinion has always been that this German merchant was fleeing his country. Later I heard that his manufactory had been burned by one of those unfortunate chances so frequent in times of war. In spite of its anxious expression the man's face showed great kindliness. His features were handsome; and the whiteness of his stout throat was well set off by a black cravat, a fact which Wilhelm showed jestingly to Prosper. The merchant accepted the offer without ceremony, like a man who feels himself able to return a civility. He drank another glass of water.. The three men were sitting in a public room in the inn in Andernach. The atmosphere of this room was hot and the flies were so numerous that Prosper requested the landlord to open the window looking toward the outer gate, so as to change the air. This window was barricaded by an iron bar, the two ends of which were inserted into holes made in the window casings. Prosper accidentally noticed the manner in which the landlord managed these obstacles and opened the window. He placed his valise on the floor and put his feet on it, took off his hat and gloves and removed a pair of pistols from his belt. The landlord having by this time set a knife and fork for him, the three guests began to satisfy their appetites in silence. In front of the inn was a little wharf, to which the boat hired by the. The landlord's room, where the two young surgeons were to sleep, adjoined the public room, and was separated by a somewhat thin partition from the kitchen. The servant-woman had left the premises to find a lodging in some crib or hayloft. It is therefore easy to see that the kitchen, the landlord's chamber, and thepublic room were, to some extent, isolated from the rest of the house. The landlord had brought the merchant and sailors into the public rooms through the door opening on the roadway. The other door opened upon the courtyard of the inn. This courtyard was surrounded by very high walls and was full, for the time being, of cattle and horses. The lapping of the river against the wharf was the only sound to be heard. In the courtyard were two large dogs, whose deep-toned barking showed vigilant and easily roused guardians. The landlord went out by a door through the kitchen to his cellar, situated, no doubt, under this portion of the building. When five venerable bottles which he presently brought back with him appeared on the table, the wife brought in the rest of the supper. ""What silence! and what a beautiful night!"" said Wilhelm, looking at the sky.. The four men, for the landlord was invited to drink, did not hear her go to bed. She gave to the dishes and to the room generally the glance of a mistress. The conversation grew lively. Prosper Magnan brought a few tears to the merchant's eyes. He talked of what his mother must be doing at that hour, while he was sitting drinking on the banks of the Rhine. ""I can see her,"" he said, ""reading her prayers before she goes to bed"" He said he could see her in her loft, reading her prayers. She replied: ""I am reading my prayers, and I am going to bed."". ""My poor Prosper; I wonder where he is now!"" he said. ""My mother won't forget me. She is accumulating a sum sufficient to buy the thirty acres adjoining her little estate at Lescheville. Those thirty acres are worth at least sixty thousand francs. Such fine fields! Ah! if I had them I'd live all my days at LesCheville, without other ambition!"" ""How my father used to long for those thirty acres and the pretty.  Wilhelm offered his bed to the merchant. ""You can accept it without hesitation,"" he said, ""for I can sleep with Prosper"" ""As for me,"" said the landlord, ""I bought a field last spring, which I had been wanting for ten years"" ""It won't be the first, nor the last time either either,"" said Wilhelm. ""I've played there!"" said the merchant, ""many's the time I've played"". ""Bah!"" said the landlord, ""my wife's bed has several mattresses; take one off and put it on the floor"" ""I am not sorry to spend the night with two brave young men, two French soldiers, for, between ourselves, I have a hundred thousand francs in gold and diamonds in my valise,"" said the German. ""I accept,"" said said the merchant, ""in fact I will admit,"" he added, lowering his voice and looking at the two Frenchmen, ""that I desired it"" ""You are our elder, and we ought to honor age!"" said one of the French..  Prosper put his case of surgical instruments and that of Wilhelm under the end of his mattress to raise it and supply the place of a bolster, which was lacking. Wahlenfer, as a measure of precaution, put his valise under his pillow. Prosper Magnan's thoughts unconsciously took an evil turn. His mind dwelt exclusively on the hundred thousand francs which lay beneath the merchant's pillow. To Prosper Mag Nan one hundred thousand Francs was a vast and ready-made fortune. To Wahlener and Wilhelm, it was a fortune of a million francs. The story was told in a book called ""The Adventures of Wilhelm Wahlenf. ""He began with extraordinary ardor to plan a crime theoretically. While fancying the death of the merchant he saw distinctly the gold and the diamonds. His eyes were dazzled by them. His heart throbbed. Fascinated by that mass of gold he intoxicated himself morally by murderous arguments"" ""In short, he planned the crime in a manner to secure himself impunity"" ""Deliberation was, undoubtedly, already crime. He began to employ it in a hundred different ways"" ""He made castles in the air, such as we all make with eager delight during the moments preceding sleep"" ""With a hundred thousand francs he planned a lifetime of happiness."" ""He saw himself prosperous, the father of a family, rich, respected in his province"". Monsieur Taillefer would cut the throat of that man, throw the body into the Rhine, and escape with the valise. He went so far as to calculate the professional ability he had reached in the use of instruments, so as to cut through his victim's throat without leaving him the chance for a single cry. The other bank of the river was occupied by the Austrian army; below the windows lay a boat and boatman. Gold would buy the boatman and he could reach the Austrians. He unscrewed the iron bars, slipped them from their places without the slightest noise, placed them against the wall, and opened the shutters, leaning heavily upon their hinges.. ""The throbbing of his heart was so strong, so deep, so sonorous, that he was terrified,"" says the author. ""He feared he could not act with coolness; his hands trembled"" But the execution of his plan was accompanied by such apparent good luck that he fancied he saw a species of predestination in this favor bestowed upon him by fate. ""When I stood by the bed,"" he said to me, ""I commended myself mechanically to God"" ""I thought he saw light. He flung the instrument on his own bed and fled into the next room, and stood before the window"" ""He thought he was going to die"". The story of a German prince who fell into a reverie by the Rhine is told in a novel by the German writer Hans Hofmann. The prince was on his way to an inn in Andernach when he fell in to a dream. He walked along the bank of the river, pacing up and down in front of the inn, trying to find sleep. The author says he was so overcome with emotion that he lost sight of the window he had left open behind."

He was a fine old man according to the statement of those who had the happiness to gaze upon his face. Socrates and Aristophanes, formerly enemies, but then become friends, contributed their features to his features. The good man had, at that time, counted as nearly as possible seventy flights of the swallow. His Homeric head was but scantily ornamented with hair, but his beard was still perfect in its flowing majesty. There was still an air of spring-time in his quiet smile, and wisdom on his ample brow. He determined to go and pay his respects to the king of France.. Pantagruel's father was a vicar at the court of Queen Catherine of France. He told the story of the death of the king to the queen and other courtiers. The story was told with such eloquence that it is impossible to equal it, says the author. The author also tells of the birth of the first king of France, Charles VII. The tale is told in the book, ""The Story of the Death of the King of France,"". Gargantua took to strange habits, which greatly astonished his household, but the which he was forgiven since he was seven hundred and four years old. St. Clement of Alexandra in his Stromates, which makes out that at this time he was a quarter of a day less, which matters little to us. Now this paternal master, seeing that everything was going wrong in his house, and that every one was fleecing him, conceived a great fear.. In a cellar of Gargantuan abode he hid away a fine heap of red wheat, beside twenty jars of mustard and several delicacies, such as plums and Tourainian rolls. Olivet cheese, goat cheese, and others, well known between Langeais and Loches, pots of butter, hare pasties, preserved ducks, pigs' trotters in bran, boatloads and pots full of crushed peas, pretty little pots of Orleans quince preserve, hogsheads of lampreys.. Tacitus wrote that the king was looking for a flying dragon or unicorn to guard the treasure. He did not want a Coquecigrue, because the Egyptians were afraid of them, as it appeared in the Hieroglyphics. He dismissed the idea of engaging the legions of Caucquemarres, because emperors disliked them. He rejected the Pechrocholiers in council assembled, the Magi, the Druids, the legion or Papimania,. The good man calling to mind old stories, had no confidence in any race, and if it had been permissible would have implored the Creator for a new one. He did not know whom to choose, and was thinking that his wealth would be a great trouble to him. When he met in his path a pretty little shrew-mouse of the noble race of shrew-mice, who bear all gules on. Master Alcofribas: ""It appears from the Ecumenical Inquiry a shrew-mouse was in Noah's Ark"" ""It was Noah, my lords, who planted the vine, and first had the honour of getting drunk upon the juice of its fruit"" ""The men have made bad marriages; not so the mice, because they are more jealous of their coat of arms than any other animals"" ""Even though he had the especial gift of being able to convert grains of sand to fine fresh hazelnuts"" ""This fine gentlemanly character so pleased the good Gargantua, that he decided to give the post of watching his granaries to the shrew. The shrew- mouse promised faithfully to accomplish his task, and to do his duty as a loyal beast, on condition that he lived on a heap of grain. Gargantua thought perfectly fair. The shrew-mouse began to caper about in his domain as happy as a prince who is happy, reconnoitering his immense empire of mustard, countries of sugar, provinces of ham, duchies of raisins, counties of chitterlings, and baronies of all sorts. Therein so splendidly did the brown colour of his hair shine forth, that one would have thought him a northern king in his sable furs.. The shrew- mouse sat on a heap of corn, and fancied himself the most illustrious of shrew-mice. He was confronted by the gentlemen of the night-prowling court, who scamper with their little feet across the floors. One old infidel of the trotting, nibbling race of mice, advanced a little, and put his nose in the air. He came to the conclusion that he was a devil, from whom nothing but scratches were to be gained. The shrew- Mouse then munched two grains of corn and sat on the heap like a king in full court.. ""I am a rat, and I am a good rat,"" says the author. ""I am not a bad rat, but a good mouse"" says the writer. The author says he is not a rat. He is a good cat. The writer says he's a good dog. The book is called ""The Cat's Tale of a Cat"" The book was written in 17th century England, and published in 1776. The novel is about the life of a dog named ""Germain"" and his adventures in the wilds of Scotland. It was written by the author, who was himself a dog, and is now a cat.. The good mouse, artful as an old courtier, resolved to try the mettle of the shrew-mouse. This would have been a laudable thing in a man, but it was far more so in a mouse, belonging to a tribe who live for themselves alone. The mouse advanced with many a bow and scrape. The shrew- mouse let him advance rather near. Then this Curtius of nibblers made his little speech, not the jargon of common mice, but in the polite language of shrew-mice. He said: 'My lord, I have heard with much concern of your glorious family, of which I am one of the most devoted slaves. I know the legend of your ancestors'. ""Your fur robe is so royally perfumed, and its colour is so splendiferously tanned, that I am doubtful if I recognise you as belonging to this race"" ""I know not with what movements, by your secret commands to give you, I know not why, licence not to listen to things, which would be displeasing to you"" ""True,' said the shrew-mouse, 'the door has just fallen"" ""You have swallowed the grain after the antique fashion. Your proboscis is a probosc is of sapience; you have kicked like a learned shrew- mouse"". ""The shrew-mouse, fancying that he had met with a faithful vassal, opened the trap of his musical orifice, and heard the noise of the grain going towards the hole. Then, without having recourse to forfeiture, the justice of commissaries, he sprang upon the old mouse and squeezed him to death. Glorious death! for the hero died in the thick of thegrain, and was canonised as a martyr"" The story is told in the play ""The Tale of the Shrew-Mice"" by the French playwright André Malraux. The play is set in the Ottoman city of. The rats and mice were in a council to consider public affairs. The rats wished to pass before the mice, and serious quarrels about precedence nearly spoiled everything. A big rat gave his arm to a mouse, and the gaffer rats and gammer mice being paired off in the same way, all were soon seated on their rumps, tails in air, muzzles stretched, whiskers stiff, and their eyes brilliant as those of a fal. A council at the Hotel de Ville could not have made a greater hubbub. One said this and another said that, and a cat passing by took fright and ran away, hearing these strange noises. A little mouse, who was not old enough to enter parliament, thrust through a chink her inquiring snout, the hair on which was as downy as that of all mice, too downy to be caught. As the tumult increased, by degrees her body followed her nose, until she came to the hoop of a cask, against which she so. An old rat perceived this pretty mouse, so gentle and shapely, and declared that the State might be saved by her. All the muzzles turned to this Lady of Good Help, became silent, and agreed to let her loose upon the shrew-mouse. She was triumphantly marched around the cellar, where, seeing her walk mincingly, mechanically move her tail, shake her cunning little head, twitch her diaphanous ears, and lick with her little red tongue the hairs just sprouting on her cheeks,. The maiden was conducted to the granary, with instructions to make a conquest of the shrew-mouse's heart, and save the fine red grain, as did formerly the fair Hebrew, Esther, for the chosen. ""The mouse promised to deliver the granaries, for by a lucky chance she was the queen of mice"" ""A merry mouse, more cunning than an old Doctor of Sorbonne fed on parchment, lively, white bellied, streaked on the back, with sweet moulded breasts, pearl-white teeth, and of a frank open nature--in fact, a true king's morsel"" ""The courtiers stood aghast. Queen Catherine smiled, but the king was in no laughing humour."" ""The mouse appeared to have been the living image of Madame Diana, then present"" "". Rabelais said that the pretty mouse enslaved him from the first moment she trotted before him. He went on without paying any attention to the winks of the Cardinal Bellay and de Chatillon, who were terrified for the good man. Rabelais: ""The pretty mouse"" was a trap used by females of all nations. The trap was set by a pretty mouse, a trap which is abundantly used by the. The superintendent overcame the scruples of his beautiful mistress. He became the slave of this incestuous and illicit love. The mouse, leading her lord by the snout, became queen of everything. She nibbled his cheese, ate the sweets, and foraged everywhere. This the shrew-mouse permitted to the empress of his heart. He was ill at ease, having broken his oath made to Gargantua, and betrayed the confidence placed in him. He said: 'I am not a man, I am a shrew-mice. I am the mistress of my lord'. The shrew-mousian was at liberty to see his good, virtuous daughter, kiss her on the forehead, and eat his fill, but always in a corner. Then there arrived a venerable old rat, weighing about twenty-five ounces, with a white tail, marching like the president of a Court of Justice, wagging his head. He followed by fifteen or twenty nephews, all with teeth as sharp as saws, who demonstrated to the shrew-mouse by little speeches and questions of all kinds that they, his relations, would soon be loyally attached to him. There was an air of truth about these promises.. Sieur Evegault was a grave rat, with a monastical paunch, having much studied scientific authorities by nibbling at their works in parchments, papers, books and volumes. He was accompanied by a black troop of black rats, all bringing with them pretty little mice, their sweethearts, for not having adopted the canons of the council of Chesil. In honour of and great reverence for his great virtue and wisdom, and his modest life, he was accompanied to the Sorbonnical by a troop of rats. It was lawful for them to have respectable women for concubines, so they brought their pretty little girls with them.. ""When the ceremony of placing them all was complete, the old cardinal of the rats lifted up his voice, and in a good rat-latin oration pointed out to the guardian of the grain that no one but God was superior to him"" ""This good gentleman's head was thoroughly turned, and he installed this fine speaking rat and his tribe in his manor, where night and day his praises and little songs in his honour were sung,"" he said. ""Not forgetting his lady, whose little paw was kissed and little tail was sniffed at by all,"" he added. ""And this oration considerably bewildered the keeper of the granary,"" he wrote.. The mistress, knowing that certain young rats were still fasting, determined to finish her work. She kissed her lord tenderly, loading him with love, and performing those little endearing antics of which one alone was sufficient to send a beast to perdition. Then in her great grief she tore out a grey hair, declaring herself, weepingly, to be the most wretched little mouse in the world. The shrew-mouse pointed out to her that she was the mistress of everything, and wished to resist. But after the lady had shed a torrent of tears he implored a truce and considered her request. Then instantly drying her tears, and giving him her paw to kiss, she advised him to arm some soldiers, trusty and tried rats, old warriors, who would go the rounds to keep watch. ""A grand feast was given in the granaries, to which no court festival or gala could be compared, not even that of the Field of the Cloth of Gold"" ""In every corner mice were making merry. Everywhere there were dances, concerts, banquets, sarabands, music, joyous songs, and epithalamia"" ""The shrew-mouse had the rest of the day to dance, play, and amuse himself, listen to the roundelays and ballads which the poets composed in his honour, play the lute and the mandore, make acrostics, eat, drink and be merry"". The mustard was strewn over the place, the hams were mangled and the corn scattered. Everything was rolling, tumbling, and falling about the floor. Field-mice were swimming in the pots, and the most cunning of them were carrying the corn into their private holes. No one passed the quince confection of Orleans without saluting it with one nibble, and oftener with two. In short, anyone with a sharp ear might have heard the frizzling frying- pans, the cries and clamours of the kitchens, the crackling of their furnaces.. Gargantua's foot-fall made the planks, the beams, and everything else tremble. Certain old rats asked each other what might mean this seignorial footstep. Some of them decamped, and they did well, for the lord and master entered suddenly and entered suddenly. The story was told by the son of Gargantua and his wife, the daughter of the king.. ""He put his feet upon these lively vermin without giving them time to squeak, and thus spoiled their best clothes, satins, pearls, velvets, and rubbish, and upset the feast"" ""You go rather far, my good man,"" said the king. ""No sire,"" replied Rabelais, ""No, but rather high"". ""My fine vicar,"" said Madame Diana, in his ear, ""suppose I were spiteful?"" ""Madame,"" said Rabelais, ""was it not well then of me to warn the king, your master, against the queen's Italians, who are as plentiful here as cockchafers?"". ""Should ye who enter here profess in jubilation Our gospel of elation, then suffer dolts to curse"" ""Some persons have charged Francis Rabelais, the imperial honour of our land, with spiteful tricks and apish pranks"" ""The king's pages, who, by express command, held torches before him"" ""A good number of marvellous works have issued since the rising of his subterranean light"". ""How would thy sides ache with laughter, how wouldst thou chuckle, if thou couldst come again for a little while to Chinon,"" he writes. ""All their life long may they find grit between their teeth, those who have ignored his good and moderate nourishment,"" he adds. ""As many dogs as Panurge found busy with his lady's robe at church, so many two-legged academic puppies have busied themselves with befouling the high marble pyramid"". ""Thine omnipotence, omniscience, and omni-language are by them bravely recognised,"" he writes. ""Thine worship is unalloyed, pure, and unadulterated,"" he adds. ""The poor son of our merry Touraine here has been anxious, however unworthily, to do thee homage by magnifying thine image,"" he says."

The landlord, reputed the best of cooks, went to prepare wedding breakfasts as far as Chatelherault, Loches, Vendome, and Blois. This said man, an old fox, perfect in his business, never lighted lamps in the day time, knew how to skin a flint, charged for wool, leather, and feathers. For a penny less than his account would have affronted even a prince. For the rest, he was a good banterer, drinking and laughing with his regular customers, hat in hand always before the persons furnished with. Three young apprentices in knavery, in whom there was more of the material that makes thieves than saints, made up their minds to amuse themselves, and live well. They demanded the best rooms, turned the place inside out, turned up their noses at everything, bespoke all the lampreys in the market, and announced themselves as first-class merchants. They never carried their goods with them, and travelled only with their persons. Now these limbs of Satan gave the slip to their masters, under whom they had been studying the art of parchment scrawling, and came to stay at the hotel of the Three Barbels. In short, if he could without disgrace have done so, he would have reckoned so much for the good air, and somuch for the view of the country.. Three dodgers made noise enough for a hundred crowns. All three arranged to play their parts like thieves at a fair. Theirs was a farce in which there was plenty of eating and drinking. For five days they so heartily attacked every kind of provision that a party of German soldiers would have spoiled less than they obtained by fraud. The host bustled about, turned the spits, and prepared a glorious repast, for these three dodgers.. Three cunning fellows made their way to the fair after breakfast, well primed, gorged, and big in the belly, and did as they liked with the greenhorns and others, robbing, filching, playing, and losing. They hustled everyone, making holes in the sacks of flour, looking for their handkerchiefs in ladies' pockets. They directed the little children wrongly, slapped the stomachs of those who were gaping in the air, and prowled about, fleecing and annoying every one. They made the dogs fight, cutting the ropes of tethered horses, throwing cats among the crowd, crying, ""Stop thief!"" And. The devil would have been a gentleman in comparison with these blackguard students, who would have be hanged rather than do an honest action. They left the fair, not fatigued, but tired of ill-doing, and spent the remainder of their time over dinner until the evening when they recommenced their pranks by torchlight. After the peddlers, they commenced operations on the ladies of the town, to whom, by a thousand dodges, they gave only that which they received, according to the axiom of Justinian: Cuiqum jus tribuere. ""To every one his own juice;"" and afterwards jokingly said to the poor wenches--""We are in the right. The three clerks ordered him with the assurance of a Provost hanging his man, to serve them quickly with a good supper as they had to depart immediately. Thinking that rogues without money would certainly look grave, he prepared a supper worthy of a canon, wishing even to see them drunk, in order the more easily to clap them in jail in the event of an accident. Not knowing how to make their escape from the room, the three companions ate and drank immoderately, looking at the situation of the windows, waiting the moment to decamp, but not getting the opportunity. The three companions were about as much at their ease as are fish upon straw, and the three clerks ate and drink immoderate, looking in the windows. The host not having seen, although he kept his eyes wide open, the royal surface of a. The landlord kept dodging about from the kitchen into the room, and from the room into the kitchen. He acted like a brave and prudent host who likes halfpence and objects to kicks. He fancied he was always being called by them, came every time they laughed, showed them a face with an unsettled look upon it, and always said, ""Gentlemen, what is your pleasure?"" This was an interrogatory in reply to which they would willingly have given him ten inches of his own spit in his stomach, because he appeared as if he knew very well what would please them at this juncture. To have twenty crowns, full weight, they would each of them have sold a third of his eternity, seeing that to have 20 crowns would be to give up a part of their eternity.. The three men sat on their seats as if they were gridirons, that their feet itched and their posteriors were rather warm. The most cunning of the three clerks, who was a Burgundian, smiled and said, seeing the hour of payment arrived, ""This must stand over for a week"" The two others, in spite of the danger, began to laugh. He was a man to take offence at anything in order that he might throw the window out the window in all security of conscience. He turned them about as though he would make them breed little ones by this excited movement. The two other men also laughed. The three men then began to enjoy themselves rather woefully. They were all very drunk.. ""I cannot permit myself to be entertained by you alone, Viscount,"" said the third student, who was from Anjou, and as artful as a woman in love. ""Neither can I,"" replied the Burgundian. ""Whichever of us shall tell the worst tale shall justify the landlord,"" said his host. ""Gentlemen! Gentlemen!"" replied the Picardian ""you are jesting. I am yours to command."" ""Who will be the judge?"" asked the Picardians.. ""My turn first,"" said the Anjou man. ""Come along, sit you down, drink, and lend us both your ears"" ""I commence,"" replied the host. ""I will tell you all about it."" ""I am going to tell you about it,"" said he, ""and you can go on with your day."" ""Yes,"" replied his host, ""I can."" ""And I will tell it to you all."" ""No, I won't."" ""You can go."" ""But I'm going to finish my drink."". The story of a man who got drunk and ended up in bed with a maid-servant. He was found nearly frozen by his neighbours, who thought he was waiting for a thaw. The story was told by Godenot, the lord of the country. The tale is told in the book ""The Wine of the World"" by William Makepeace Thackeray, published in 18th century England, and translated by William MacIntosh, in ""The Book of the Wine. ""God has punished me for not going to vespers at Church,"" said the labourer. ""An error is not a sin,"" said he to the penitent. ""You will fast tomorrow, and be absolved."" ""I am a man of God, and I will not be ashamed of my sins,"" he said. ""I will fast, and my sins will be forgiven,"" he added. ""And I will go and live in peace with my God"" ""I have no regrets,"" he replied. ""My sins have been forgiven."" ""My wife will never forgive me for this,"" he told her. ""But I will live with the guilt of my sin."". ""You must drink water, and eat nothing but a quarter of a loaf and an apple,"" said the rector. ""Then the good man, who had no confidence in his memory, went home, repeating to himself the penance ordered"" ""As he heaved a sigh on taking the last mouthful of bread hardly knowing where to put it, for he was full to the chin, his wife remonstrated with him, that God did not desire the death of a sinner,"" he said. ""He would not be reproached for having put things in their wrong places,"" said his wife, ""and so he kept his fast."". ""I've payed my share, it's your turn, Viscount,"" added he of Anjou, giving the Picardian a knowing wink. ""Moist stories slip out easier,"" he said. ""If it chokes me, I must fast."" ""The goblets are empty. Hi, there! More wine."" ""Let us drink,"" cried the Picardians, ""Let me tell you a story."" ""If you like it, you can buy it."" ""No, I don't want to buy it. I want to hear it."". A Picardian, having heard speak of Paris, took it into her head to go there. She trudged bravely along the road, and arrived with a pocket full of emptiness. There she fell in, at the Porte St. Denise, with a company of soldiers, placed there for a time as a vidette. The sergeant seeing this hooded linnet coming, stuck his headpiece on one side, straightened his feather, twisted his moustache, cleared his throat, rolled his eyes, put his hand on his hips, and stopped the Picardian to see if her ears were properly pierced. Then he asked her, by way of a joke, but with a serious face, what brought her there, he pretending to believe she had come to take the keys of Paris by assault.. ""I am from Picardy, and will get you taken in here, where you will be treated as a queen would often like to be,"" said the wag. ""Then he led her to the guard-house, where he told her to sweep the floor, polish the saucepans, stir the fire, and keep a watch on everything,"" he said. ""The girl cleaned the room and prepared the meals so well, singing and humming, that this day the soldiers found in their den the look of a monk's refectory"" The story is told in the play ""The Thief"" by Jean-Baptiste Lamarque, who was born in Picardy in 17th century. The play is set in Paris, but the author has no connection with the city.. The girl was taken to the commandant's bed, who was in town with his lady. The soldiers petted and caressed her after the manner of philosophical soldiers. She rose happy at bearing no marks of the sharp skirmish. Although slightly fatigued, she managed to get across the fields into the open country with her thirty sols. On the route to Picardy, she met one of her friends, who, like herself, wished to try service in Paris, and was hurrying thither, and seeing her, asked her what sort of places they were.""'Ah! Perrine; do not go,' she replied. 'I am a soldier, and I will not go'. ""Now, big-belly of Burgundy,"" said he, giving his neighbour a hearty slap, ""spit out your story or pay!"" ""By the queen of Antlers!"" replied the Burgundian, ""by my faith, by the saints, by God! and by the devil, I know only stories of the Court of Burgundies"" ""Eh, ventre Dieu! are we not in the land of Beauffremont?"" cried the other, pointing. Franc-Taupin was a sergeant of justice, always grumbling, always fighting. He took unto himself a wife, and by chance he was blessed with one as mild as the peel of an onion. She took more pains to bring joy to his house than would another to bestow horns upon him. But he was always surly and crabbed, and no more spared his wife blows, than does a debtor promises to the bailiff's man. This unpleasant treatment continuing in spite of the carefulness and angelic behaviour of the poor woman, she being unable to accustom herself to it, was compelled to inform her relations, who thereupon came to the house. She was then forced to tell her husband of the affair.. The husband and wife were visiting a friend when the husband complained about his wife. He said she was an idiot and made his life almost unbearable. The wife, astonished, contented herself with stoutly denying the fault imputed to her. The couple were staying with a friend of the friend's in Paris. The husband complained that his wife never made him a good meal. The friend's wife denied the husband's complaint. The pair were later reunited. The story was told in a play. The play was called ""The Husband and the Wife"" by H.E. H. Bennett. The book was published in 1847. It was a success. The author, Hector Bruno, was knighted in 1849. He died in 1875.. ""I shall then henceforth be both wife and mistress!' said the housewife to her husband. ""I will never lift my hand against her again, but will resign to her my halberd and my breeches, and give her full authority here."" ""The plates were clean enough to see one's face in, the mustard was fresh and well made, the dinner beautifully cooked, as appetising as stolen fruit."" ""I am a man of the world, and I will not be ashamed to say that I am a woman of the universe"" ""I have never been so happy in my life as I have been in this one night."" ""You are a woman, and you are my wife. I will never be ashamed of that."". ""A cursed hen, who had taken it into her head to get on top of the arbor to gorge herself with grapes, let fall a large lump of dirt right in the middle of the cloth"" ""Now, all of them seeing everything so well arranged, uttered exclamations of pleasure, except the diabolical husband, who remained moody and sullen, knitting his brows and looking for a straw on which to hang a quarrel with his wife"" ""I was half dead with fright; so great was her despair, she could think of no other way of remedying the thoughtlessness of the fowl then by covering the unseemly patch with a plate in which she put the fine fruits"". ""Here's your dinner, nice and hot, well served, the cloth is clean, the salt- cellars full, the plates clean, and the wine fresh, the bread well baked. What is there lacking? What do you require? WhatDo you desire? What else do you want?' "" "" ""Oh, filth!"" said he, in a great rage. ""The good woman instantly lifted the plate, and replied-- 'There you are, my dear!' "". ""Who has told the worst now?"" cried the Anjou man, giving the host a tap on the shoulder. ""He has! He has!"" said the two others. From that time forward the sergeant lived. ""I'll settle the question,"" cried the host, seeing that whereas they had all three been ready with their own accounts, not one of them was thinking of his. Then they began to dispute among themselves, like the holy fathers in council; seeking, by creating a confusion, throwing the glasses at each other, and jumping about, a lucky chance, to make a run of it. ""I will tell you a better one than all, then you will have to give ten sols a head,"" said the one from Anjou. ""Silence for the landlord"" said the other. ""You will give it to me in a minute,"" replied the host.. The couple were soon betrothed, and the marriage was arranged. But the joy of the first night did not draw nearer without occasioning some slight apprehensions to the lady. She was liable, through an infirmity, to expel vapours, which came out like bombshells. The lady's mother told her that this faculty of engineering wind was inherent in the family, and that in her time she had been greatly embarrassed by it, but only in the earlier period of her life. 'But,' said she to her daughter, 'I have ever a sure specific, left to me by my mother, which brings these surplus explosions to nothing, and exhales them noiselessly'. ""The girl, much pleased, learned how to sail close to the wind, thanked her mother, and danced away merrily"" ""The husband came; I leave you to imagine how love's conflict sped"" ""When climbing into her place, the pent up force went off with such a loud discharge, that you would have thought with me that the curtains were split"" ""By this means these sighs become odourless, and scandal is avoided."" ""The bride arose under a false pretext, and quickly returned again"". ""It was my wife,"" he said. ""Ha! ha! ha!"" went the clerks. ""Did you ever hear a better story, Viscount?"" ""Ha, ha! It beats all the other. ""By the faith of a Christian, I never heard a better story in my life"" ""I should like to kiss the orchestra"" ""After that I say there are no stories like the stories of our host"" ""We cannot leave without seeing the hostess, and if we do not ask to kiss this famous wind-instrument, it is out of respect for so good a story-teller"" ""Let us go to her"" ""She will not come"". The host took the candle and went upstairs first, to light them and show them the way. But seeing the street door ajar, the rascals took to their heels, and were"
0.84,0.94,61.70505328291509,"Messire Bruyn, he who completed the Castle of Roche-Corbon-les- Vouvray, on the banks of the Loire, was a boisterous fellow in his youth. Now by making his crowns sweat and his goods scarce, draining his land, and a bleeding his hogsheads, he found himself excommunicated from decent society. He had for his friends only the plunderers of towns and the Lombardians. But the usurers turned rough and bitter as chestnut husks, when he had no other security to give them than his said estate ofoche-corbon. The Rupes Carbonis was held from our Lord the king, since the R upes Carboni was held by our Lord.. Bruyn was in the humour to give a blow here and there, to break a collar-bone or two, and quarrel with everyone about trifles. The Abbot of Marmoustiers, his neighbour, told him that it was an evident sign of lordly perfection, that he was walking in the right road. He would undoubtedly return full of wealth and indulgences into Touraine, or into Paradise, as all barons formerly came from there. He left the country equipped by the monastery, and blessed by the abbot, to the great delight of his friends and neighbours.. Bruyn was a knight of the Vouvrillons. He fought in the Crusades. He was a good Christian and loyal knight. He more willingly gave a crown to the girls than to the poor. But like a good Touranian he made soup of anything. He returned from the Crusade laden with crowns and precious stones, rather differently from some who, rich when they set out, came back heavy with leprosy, but light with gold. He never questioned the infidels until after he had killed them. He put to the sack enough many towns of Asia and Africa, and fell upon the infIDels without giving them warning, burning the Saracens, the Greeks, the English, and others, caring little whether they were friends or enemies, or where they came from.. On his return from Tunis, our Lord, King Philippe, made him a Count, and appointed him his seneschal in our country and that of Poitou. There he was greatly beloved and properly thought well of. Over and above his good qualities he founded the Church of the Carmes-Deschaulx, in the parish of Egrignolles, as the peace-offering to Heaven for the follies of his youth. Thus was he cardinally consigned to the good graces of the Church and of God. From a wicked youth and reckless man, he became a good, wise man, and discreet in his dissipations and pleasures. rarely was in anger, unless someone blasphemed God before him, the which he would not tolerate.. He possessed a castle all jagged at the corners, and shaped and pointed like a Spanish doublet, situated upon a bank from which it was reflected in the Loire. In the rooms were royal tapestries, furniture, Saracen pomps, vanities, and inventions which were much admired by people of Tours. He was one of the strongest knights-banneret of the province, and could easily have led to battle for our lord the king a thousand men. He sent as a free gift a banner fringed with fine gold. ""Let this one go, Brediff, he will count against those I inconsiderately slaughtered across the seas""; oftentimes, however, he would let them bravely hang on a chestnut tree or swing on his gallows. He only persecuted the Jews now and then, and when they were glutted with usury and wealth. For the rest, most devout, finishing everything quickly, his prayers as well as good wine, he managed the processes after the Turkish fashion, having a thousand little jokes ready for the losers, and dining with them to console them. He had all the people who had been hanged buried in consecrated ground like godly ones, some people thinking they had been sufficiently punished by having their breath stopped. Some people thought they had. been sufficiently punishment by having the breath stopped, some thought they. had been enough punished.. Bruyn was a courtier in the court of the Abbot of Marmoustiers in France. He was known for his jovial nature and his love of the little people. Bruyn was known as the ""Seneschal of the Levant"" and was a friend of the king. He died in 1536. He is buried in the town of Marmite. He wrote: ""I am the Seneschal. I am the judge. I have the right to rule."" He was also known as ""the Judge of the Land"" and ""the Justice of the land"" He was a great lover of the small people. He loved the children. He would tell them to play with the ball until he whipped them.. In the year of the great over-flowing of the Loire there were only twenty-two malefactors hanged that winter, not counting a Jew burned in the Commune of Chateau-Neuf for having stolen a consecrated wafer, or bought it, some said, for he was very rich. For this almost nameless crime it was equally decided by the king, people, and the churchmen that the Mooress, to pay for all, should be burned and cooked alive in the square near the fountain where the herb market is. The Mooress was an abandoned pretty little girl, about the age of an old dog, stark naked, an acrobat, and of Moorish descent like themselves.. The Mooress was crying her eyes out in the jail and would certainly be converted to God in order to live as long as a crow, if she were allowed to do so. The seneschal replied that if the foreigner would wholly commit herself to the Christian religion there would be a gallant ceremony of another kind. He would undertake that it should be royally magnificent, because he would be her sponsor at the baptismal font, and that a virgin should be his partner in the affair. The ladies of the town and other persons of authority said loudly that they were cheated of a fine ceremony, since the Mooress had already been converted to the true religion. Then the good man Bruyn clearly and dextrously demonstrated to the others that it would be most profitable and pleasant to God to gain over this African soul. If the devil were lodged in this feminine body the faggots would be useless to burn him, as said the said order.. The young Mooress did not hesitate between the flaming faggots and the baptismal water. She much preferred to be a Christian and live than be Egyptian and be burned. For the greater surety of her religion she was placed in the convent of nuns near Chardonneret. The said ceremony was concluded at the residence of the archbishop, where on this occasion, in honour of the Saviour or men, the lords and ladies of Touraine hopped, skipped and danced. In this country the people dance, skip, eat, flirt, have more feasts and make merrier than any in the whole world. The young virgin men, unmarried or so esteemed to distinguish them from the husbands and the widowers, but the girls always pick them without the name. The lady of Azay-le-Brusle was left before Acre, a far distant town, in the hands of a Saracen who demanded a royal ransom for him because the said lord was of high position. She remained, without a penny in the the world, awaiting her lord in a poor lodging in the town, but proud as the Queen of Sheba and brave as a mastiff who defends the property of his master. Seeing this great distress the seneschal went delicately to request this lady's daughter to be the godmother of the said Egyptian, in order that he might have the right of assisting the Lady of Azays.. Bruyn was envious of Blanche of Azay, who was dancing among the ladies of Tours. He was so overcome with desire that he decided to clasp a chain of gold around her neck. He hung there at the same time his domain, and his white hairs, his money and his horses, in short, he placed there everything he possessed, directly he had seen Blanche dancing a pavan among the Ladies of Tours, and he wanted to be with her. He kept the gold chain with him, but he also wanted to hold on to his white hair, which he had kept since the taking of Cyprus. He also kept his horses and all his possessions, including his gold chain, and wanted to keep them with him. He wanted to have Blanche as his wife, but his head had too much snow on it to let love lodge there.. A castle without a chatelaine is as well have a clapper without its bell, says the King. The King wanted to have a wife so that he would not have to wait for the Lady of Azay to give him one. He feared that if he waited, he would pass out of this world and into the other.. The said Blanche was slender and graceful as no other girl, and still better than that, more maidenly than ever maiden was. She was all ignorant of love, who knew not why or what it was; a maiden who wondered why certain people lingered in their beds. She believed that children were found in parsley beds. The archbishop who married them the week after said they were a beautiful bridal, and a still more beautiful bride. The bride was a maiden all ignorant, and ignorant ofLove, who wondered not why, or what, it was that made people stay in bed. The groom was an old man, but he thought little of his severe wounds, and less of the eighty years that had stripped his head. He thought less of his wounds, but of his young companion.. Blanche was a sweet flower, and intact, joyous and innocent; an angel, who needed but the wings to fly away to Paradise. Her mother had thus reared her in innocence, without even allowing her to consider, trifle as it was, how she sucked in her soup between her teeth. When she left the poor lodging of her weeping mother to consummate her betrothal at the cathedral of St. Gatien and St. Maurice, the country people came to a feast their eyes upon the bride, and on the carpets which were laid down all along the the Rue de la Scellerie. All said that never had tinier feet pressed the ground of Touraine, prettier eyes gazed up to heaven, or a more splendid festival adorned the streets with carpets and with flowers. The young girls of. St. Martin and of the boroughs of Chateau-. The Lady of Azay received a large sum of money after the ceremony, which enabled her to start immediately for Acre to go to her spouse. The women desired a harvest of Moorish girls, a deluge of old seneschals, and baskets full of Egyptian baptisms. But this was the only one that ever happened in Touraine, seeing that the country is far from Egypt and from Bohemia. The old soldier was so merry by her side, that his happiness showed itself in his wrinkles, his looks, and his movements. Although he was hardly as straight as a billhook, he held himself so by the side of Blanche, that one would have taken him for a soldier on parade receiving his officer, and he placed his hand on his diaphragm like a man whose pleasure stifles and troubles him.. The marriage ceremony finished and at an end--for it lasted three days, to the great contentment of the people.Messire Bruyn with great pomp led the little one to his castle, and, according to the custom of husbands, had her put solemnly to bed in his couch, which was blessed by the Abbot of Marmoustiers. When old Bruyn, perfumed all over, found himself side by side with his pretty wife, he kissed her first upon the forehead, and then upon the little round, white breast, on the same spot where she had allowed him to clasp the fastenings of the chain, but that was all that was needed for the ceremony to end. The little one's mother, who was a nurse, cured the leprous Sire d'Azay, and she tended him herself. Blanche was not at all astonished at the demeanour of her spouse, because she was a virgin in mind. In marriage she saw only that which is visible to the eyes of young girls. She played with the gold tassels on the bed, and marvelled at the richness of the shrine in which her innocence should be interred. The old fellow had too great confidence in himself in fancying himself able to accomplish more. He abstained from love in spite of the merry nuptial songs, the epithalamiums and jokes which were going on in the rooms beneath where the dancing was still kept up. He refreshed himself with a drink of the marriage beverage, which according to custom, had been blessed.. The seneschal tried to substitute the word for the deed. He entertained his wife in various ways, promised her the keys of his sideboards, his granaries and chests. She became like a young charger full of hay, found her good man the most gallant fellow in the world. He feared those handy tricks, little kisses, and minor amusements of love which formerly he did not object to, but which at the present time would have found him cold as the obit of a pope. He would have given her the perfect government of his houses and domains without any control, hanging round her neck ""the other half of the loaf,"" which is the popular saying in Touraine. She would have been permitted, without any sin, to sleep every night in a beautiful green brocaded bed. He had not been used to maidens, but knew from experience the little tricks that women will practice.. ""Oh! Oh!"" replied she laughing, ""I shall amuse myself much there catching butterflies."" ""That's a good girl,"" says her lord, ""And the woods?"" ""Ah! I should not like to be there alone, you will take me there"" ""Oh no!"" said she. ""Nor shall I be till I have had a child."" ""Oh, I am so proud of you,"" he said. ""I am so happy for you"". ""But did you see at the stable the beautiful white mare so much spoken of in Touraine?"" ""Yes, she is very gentle and nice,"" replied the seneschal. ""Well, I give her to you, and you can ride her as often as the fancy takes you."" ""Oh, you are very kind, and they did not lie when they told me so,"" replied she. ""Here,"" continued he, ""sweetheart; the butler, the chaplain, the treasurer, the equerry, the farrier, the. The beautiful and the virtuous come of immaculate fathers, writes the Abbot of Marmoustiers. ""Because it is necessary above all things that both the one and the other of us should be in a state of grace before God,"" he adds. The beautiful and virtuous come from immaculates fathers, says the Abbots of MarMoustiers, as the Abbott of Marroustiers has done this one.. ""You are very perfect,"" said the cunning lord, ""and I am delighted to have you for a wife; but I have sworn like an infidel"" ""I received before Mass absolution for all my faults and have remained since without committing the slightest sin,"" she replied. ""Oh! and why?"" he asked. ""Because the dancing did not finish, and I could not have you to myself to bring you here and kiss you"" ""Yes,"" she said. ""I will take care tomorrow that you shall not sin,"" and she left the old man quite smitten with her white beauty, amorous of her delicate nature, and as embarrassed to know how he should be able to keep her in her innocence.. The Seneschal's wife, Blanche, was so innocent that he abused her. He kissed her sweet golden tresses, the beautiful eyelids, and her ripe red mouth. He did it softly for fear of waking her. There was all his fruition, the dumb delight which still inflamed his heart. Then he deplored the snows of his leafless old age, the poor old man, that he saw clearly that God had amused himself by giving him nuts when his teeth were gone. The Senes Chalch married Blanche and they had a son, who died in a car accident. The couple had a daughter, who was also a senator.. At one time he would say that lords did not behave like common people, that the children were only planted at certain celestial conjunctions ascertained by learned astrologers. Sometimes he would pretend that if by chance the parents were not in a state of grace, the children commenced on the date of St. Claire would be blind. Sometimes that those begotten in February were chilly; in March, too turbulent; in April, were worth nothing at all; and that handsome boys were conceived in May. At another that one should abstain from begetting children on feast days, because it was a great undertaking; and he observed the feasts like a man who wished to enter into Paradise without consent. He pretended that if St. Gatien had the gout, St. Agnes were scaldheaded and St. Roch. Blanche was always thinking of her much-desired child. She was like a woman who has a desire in her head, without suspecting that she was behaving like a gay lady or a town-walker running after her enjoyment. But in this pursuit, Blanche gained an appetite of nun and prelate, that is to say, wished to procreate, had her desires whetted, and could scarcely restrain her hunger, when on her return she gave play to her teeth. She could not restrain herself when she returned to the Lady of Azay, who was to be confined to her bed. The child was to have his hair of two colours, and to have it in two colours. The Lady was to await the return of her husband's wife, the seneschal, to confinement the child. Blanche concluded that the Seneschal was annoyed by her requests, and was perhaps right, since he was old.. The story of a woman who was born with a love of war is told in the novel ""The Art of War"" The story is based on the life of a young woman who fell in love with a man who was a soldier. The woman's love for war was so strong that she was able to fight back against her husband's attempts to stop her. The story of the woman is told by the author as a story of her love for her husband. The author is not sure what happened to the man, but believes that he was killed by his wife's lust for war, and that he should be buried with her in a grave. The novel is called ""The art of war"" and is published by Simon & Schuster, London.. The Countess was incommoded by her innocence, which gave more trouble than it was worth to her brain, and gnawed her all over. Many times in the evening she wished to dance. One wet morning, when the weather was that in which the snails make their tracks, a melancholy time, and suitable to reverie, Blanche was in the house sitting in her chair in deep thought. Nothing produces more lively concoctions of the substantive essences, and no receipt, specific or philter is more penetrating, transpiercing or doubly transpiers and titillating than the subtle warmth which simmers between the nap of the chair and a maiden sitting during certain weather.. ""Whence comes your sadness, sweetheart?"" said he to her. ""From shame,"" she replied. ""Because I am without a child, and you without lineage?"" he replied. She replied: ""Because all my neighbours have it, and I was married to have it"" He replied: ""Nay! Look! . . . All my neighbours' wives give them lapfuls of children."". ""Were it not that in giving them birth women die, and that for this you are still too delicate and too close in the bud, you would already be a mother,"" replied the seneschal. ""But will you buy one ready-made?--that will cost you neither pain nor labour."" ""But,"" said she, ""I want the pain and labour, without which it will not be ours"" ""I feel that if I had only the half of one, I would kiss it, swaddle it, and unharness it,"" she said. ""I would make it jump and crow all day long, as the other ladies do."" ""What will become of your name and your fiefs and your seigniories? A child is our. ""I know very well it should be the fruit of my body, because at church they say that Jesus was the fruit. of the Virgin's womb."" ""Many a lady has conceived after the neuvaine; you must not fail to do one."" ""I know that I will be a mother one day,"" said Blanche. ""I will be the mother of a thousand children."" ""You will be my mother,"" replied Blanche, ""and I will make you a mother"" ""I am a mother, and I will not be a father,"" said the Virgin, ""but I will become a mother."" ""And I will have a daughter, and a son,"" said she, ""because I am a daughter."" ""Yes,"" replied the Virgin. ""And a son."". The seneschal was waggling about in his saddle, like a diadem upon the head of a cow, and seeing so frolicsome and so pretty a lady by the side of so old a fellow,"

The last priest in our country who theologically kept a woman in his parsonage, regaling her with his scholastic love, was a certain vicar of Azay-le-Ridel. The custom has since been interdicted by the council, as everyone knows, because, indeed, it was not pleasant that the private confessions of people should be retold to a wench who would laugh at them, besides the other secret doctrines, ecclesiastical arrangements, and speculations.. The vicar was a Tourainian, id est, dark, and had in his eyes flame to light, and water to quench all the domestic furnaces that required lighting or quenching. A handsome vicar, square-shouldered, fresh coloured, always blessing and chuckling, preferred weddings and christenings to funerals, a good joker, pious in Church, and a man in everything. Never since at Azay has been such vicar seen!. The vicar was beloved by all who saw him leave his house. He never played artful tricks under the cloak of morality. He said he would rather be in a good bed then in anybody's will. He had plenty of everything, and wanted nothing. He was a man of the people. He would not have been surprised if he had been a saint. The vicar died in 1858. He died in 1861. He is buried in St. Paul's Cathedral, London, with his family. He has been buried in the churchyard of St. Peter's, in the parish of the same name.. The vicar of Sacche, France, was a great friend of the poor. He was known for his kindness to the sick and poor. His hand was always in his pocket, and he melted at the sight of misery. He caused hearty laughter at the wedding of the lord of Valennes, near Sacche.. The vicar gave the boy a tap on the cheek, telling him that he was too greasy and dirty to show himself to people of high rank. He himself would deliver the said message to the boy, and that he himself would give it to the mother of the lord. The boy was a kitchen boy. The mother had a good deal to do with the victuals, roast meats and other delicacies, of which there was sufficient quantity to feed a small town at least. People came to the wedding from Montbazon, from Tours, from Chinon, from Langeais, and from everywhere, and stopped eight days. A true story is that concerning the manner in which this worthy pastor lost his mistress, to whom the ecclesiastical authorities allowed no successor. The vicar did not want for domestic utensils. In the parish everyone thought it an honour to lend him theirs, the more readily because he was not the man to spoil anything, and was careful to clean them out thoroughly. One evening the good man came home to supper with a melancholy face, because he had just put into the ground a good farmer, whose death came about in a strange manner, and is still frequently talked about in Azay. Those who did not understand the affair burst out laughing to see Madame get up and go to the vicar, because she knew he referred to the pudding.. ""My dear, I am still quite overcome at the death of poor Cochegrue,"" said the woman. ""There is not at the present moment a good housewife's tongue or a virtuous cuckold's lips that are not talking about it."" ""Oh! Oh!"" said the man. ""Ha! Ha!"" said his wife. ""Has anyone deceived you?"" ""Ha!"" said her husband. ""Oh!"" ""Ha"" said the girl. ""Have you passed before the Lombard, met two black crows, or seen the dead man turn. A stallion kept by the Sieur de la Carte, in a field, in order to have a good breed of horses. The said animal was fleet of foot, as handsome as an abbot, and so high and mighty that the admiral who came to see it, said it was a beast of the first quality. His family, horrified at the danger, did not go to open the stable door, fearing the strange embrace and the kicks of the iron-shod lover. At last, Cochegrue's wife went, but just as the good mare was half way through the door, the cursed stallion seized her,. ""Oh! the mare!"" exclaimed the vicar's good wench. ""You men wouldn't have cracked a plumstone for us"" ""There,"" answered the vicars, ""you wrong me."" The good man threw her so angrily upon the bed, attacked and treated her so violently that she split into pieces, and died immediately"". The good people of the country, even the women, agreed that he was not to blame, but that his conduct was warranted by the circumstances. Que l'aze le saille! is so much coarser in its actual wording, that out of respect for the ladies I will not mention it. But this was not the only clever thing that this great and noble vicar achieved, for before this misfortune he did such a stroke of business that no robbers dare ask him how many angels he had in his pocket, even had they been twenty strong and over to attack him. One evening when his good woman was still with him, after supper, and was reclining in his chair thinking where he could build a new barn for the tithes, a message came for him from the lord of Sacche. ""Our good vicar perceived a high toby,"" says the author. ""He is a good man and loyal lord. I will go."" Thereupon he passed into the church, took the silver box where the blessed bread is, rang the little bell himself in order not to wake the clerk, and went lightly and willingly along the roads. The priest walked up to the robber, tipped him up, seized his loaded stick, and when the rascal got up to struggle with him, he gutted him with a blow well planted in the middle of his stomach. ""Oh! oh!"" said the priest, putting down the sacred vase on a stone at the corner of the bridge, ""stop thou there without moving."". ""If I had relied upon thy providence, we should have been lost,"" he said. He addressed them not to God, but to the Archbishop of Tours, who had rebuked him. He died in this heresy, for he could never understand how crops could come without digging, if God so willed it. He imitated the saints in the division of their goods and mantles, which they gave formerly to the poor and the passers-by. He also imitated them in the way they divided their possessions, and gave them to poor people. He was a splendid model of a pastor, and a model of the model of God's people, too, as he gave his possessions to the sick and poor. He gave his life for the sake of the poor.. A priest was returning from Tours when he met a pretty girl on foot. She was visibly fatigued, and could scarcely raise one foot before the other. He begged her so gently to ride behind him on his mule, and in so polite a fashion, that the lass got up. The good priest, who was too good a sportsman to frighten the birds, especially the hooded ones, begged her to ride with him. She agreed, but not without making those little excuses and grimaces that they all make. The girl was riding so uncomfortably that the priest pointed out to her, after leaving Ballan, that she had better hold on to him. Immediately my lady put her plump arms around the waist of her cavalier, in a modest and timorous manner. The sheep paired off with the shepherd, the mule jogged along after the fashion of mules, while the girl slipped now this way now that. The vicar said to her: ""There, you don't slip about now. Are you comfortable?"". The vicar and the wench knew each other's thoughts, but not those of the mule. When they were both acclimatised, he with her and she with him, they felt an internal disturbance which resolved itself into secret desires. The vicar said to his companion, ""Here is a fine cluster of trees which has grown very thick."" The girl replied, ""It is too near the road"". ""Are you not married?"" asked the vicar. ""No,"" said she. ""Bad boys have cut the branches, and the cows have eaten the young leaves."" ""What a shame, at your age!"" he said. ""You see, a poor girl who has had a child is a bad bargain."" ""You are right, sir,"" she replied. ""I'faith!"". The girl was on her way to Azay when she was approached by the vicar. He asked her not to be afraid of him, for he would perform a marital experiment with her. The virtuous maiden ran into the thickest part of the wood to get away from him. She called out, ""Oh, you wicked man, you shan't know where I am."" The girl was later found in a glade where the grass was good. The vicar and the priest both freely discounted the joys of paradise. The girl later found out that he had been lying to her about the joy of paradise, and had been trying to get her to marry him. The story was told by the daughter of a local nobleman.. The good priest had it in his heart to thoroughly instruct her, and found his pupil very docile"

He read a crumpled telegram from his pocket. The telegram was at the bottom of it all. SATHERWAITE, '. ""Merry Christmas!"" growled Satherwaite, throwing the offending sheet of buff paper into the flames. ""Looks like it, doesn't it? Confound Phil's Aunt Louise, anyway! What business has she getting sick at Christmas time?"". Satherwaite growled again, more savagely, at the thought of Phil's sister. He had promised his roommate to spend Christmas with him, thereby bringing upon himself pained remonstrances from his own family. He kicked forth his feet, and brought brass tongs and shovel clattering on the. At six, his own boarding house being closed for the recess, he had trudged through the snow to a restaurant in the square. He had dined miserably on lukewarm turkey and lumpy mashed potatoes. And now it was nearly eight, and he did not even care to smoke. His one chance of reaching his own home had passed, and there was nothing for it but to get through the inter. Satherwaite's depression increased and, of a sudden, inaction became intolerable. He would go and see somebody, anybody, and make them talk to him. But, when he had his coat in his hands, he realized that even this comfort was denied him. He had friends in town, nice folk who would be glad to see him.. Phil's notebook was not his own, and it did not look like Phil's. He remembered then. He had borrowed it from Doyle almost a week before, at a lecture. He copied some of the notes, and had forgotten to return the book. It was very careless of him; he would return it as soon as--Then he recollected having seen Doyle at noon that day, coming from one of the cheaper boarding. He had known Doyle at preparatory school, and since then, at college, had maintained the acquaintance in a casual way. He liked Doyle, always had, just as any man must like an honest, earnest, gentlemanly fellow, whether their paths run parallel or cross only at rare intervals.. Satherwaite had to climb two flights of steep and very narrow stairs, and when he stood at Doyle's door, he thought he must have made a mistake. From within came the sounds of very unstudious revelry, laughter, a snatch of song, voices raised in good. Satherwaite entered a small study, shabbily furnished, but cheerful and homelike by reason of the leaping flames in the grate and the blue haze of tobacco smoke that almost hid its farther wall. About the room sat six men, their pipes held questioningly away from their mouths and their eyes fixed wonderingly, half resentfully,. Satherwaite was embarrassed by the intrusion. He held out Doyle's book. Doyle said he was sorry; they were just having a little--a sort of a Christmas-eve party, you know. He heard the youth in the faded cricket-blazer tell the man next to him, in a stage aside, that. Satherwaite studied the assemblage, and replied that he thought not, though he remembered having seen several of them at lectures and things. Doyle made no move toward introducing his friends to Satherwaites. SatherWAite was of half a mind to stay. The thought of his empty room dismayed him.. Satherwaite removed his coat. ""You're sure I shan't be intruding, Doyle?"" he asked. ""Glad to have you. Nothing much doing. Few friends, Quiet evening. Let me take your coat."". Satherwaite looked around the circle. Everyone save Ailworth and Doyle was staring blankly at the fire. Doyle broke out explosively with: ""Any of you fellows got a pipe that's not working?"". ""I've got a sort of a pipe here,"" said Doak, ""if you're not overparticular what you smoke"" Satherwaite received the pipe gravely. It was a blackened briar, whose bowl was burned halfway down on one side, from being lighted. ""It seems a jolly old pipe,"" he said, ""I fancy you must be rather fond of it"" Satherwaite filled his pipe carefully. He placed the stem between his lips, and drew on it once or twice, with satisfaction. He had won the first trick, he told himself.. Satherwaite left out all mention of Phil's sister, naturally, and ended with: ""And so, when I saw you fellows having such a Christian, comfortable sort of a time, I simply couldn't break away again"" He pictured himself to his audience on the verge of suicide from melancholia, and assured them that this fate had been averted only through his dislike of being found. ""It's the nearest thing to a real Christmas that I've known for seven years,"" said Ailworth gravely. Satherwaite observed him wonderingly. ""It's just like being kids again,"" said Doak.. Kranch, whose home was in Michigan, began speaking reminiscently of the Christmases he had spent when a lad in the pine woods. Somers told of a Christmas he had once spent in a Quebec village; and Ailworth followed him with an account of Christmas morning in a Maine-coast fishing town. Satherwaite was silent. He had no Christmased of his. Satherwaite felt that, somehow, he had been cheated out of a pleasure which should have been his. Doyle had arisen stealthily and turned out the gas. Outside they could see the flakes falling silently, steadily, between them and the electric lights that shone.. The tree was brilliantly lighted now, and the strings of cranberries caught the beams ruddily. Doak stirred the fire, and Doyle, turning from a whispered consultation with some of the others, approached Satherwa. ""No girls!"" cried Doak. ""I want the cranberries!"" cried Smith; ""I love cranberries."" ""I get the popcorn, then!"" That was the sedate Ailworth. ""You'll be beastly sick,"" said Doak, grinning jovially through his. The room was in a constant roar of mirth. Doyle was conferring excitedly with Ailworth across the room. By and by, he stole forward, and, detaching one of the packages from the tree, erased and wrote on it.. Satherwaite, very red, ran his finger over the edges of the leaves, examined it long, as though he had never seen anything like it before, and placed it in his waistcoat pocket. S. ""Open it up, old man!"" exclaimed Satherwaite. ""I'm awfully much obliged, SatherWaite,"" said Doyle, ""but, really, I couldn't think of taking--"". The men drew once more around the hearth, munching the pink and white confectionery enjoyingly. Smith insisted upon having the cranberries, and wore them around his neck. The popcorn was distributed equally, and the next day, in the parlor car,. ""Merry Christmas, all!"" cried Smith. He had a rich tenor voice, and he sang all the songs he knew. When it could be done, by hook or by crook, the others joined. Satherwaite held Doak's pet pipe clenched between his teeth as he left. He grinned, scooping a handful of snow, sent it fairly against the glass. Instantly, the windows banged up, and six heads thrust themselves out. They"

I have no patience with people who talk that kind of nonsense about marrying for love and the like. For my part I don't know what they mean, and I don’. Mattie's uncle says she must set up to be in love with Jack Halibut. 'You can't pretend poor Jack's are, him being but a blacksmith's man, and not in regular work even,' he says. 'Mattie, my girl, I would be the last to say anything against any young man you fancied, especially a decent chap like young Halibuts' 'Let's have no waterworks,' he goes on, for Mattie had got the corner of her apron up and her mouth screwed down at the corners. 'She must walk home from. 'I've known what poverty is, my girl, and you shan't never have a taste of it with my consent,' says uncle. 'The bit I've put by for you, lass, it's enough for one, but it's not enough for two' 'I don't care how poor I be, father,' said Mattie, 'it's Jack I care about' 'Now, you give me your word--and keep it I know you will--like an honest girl.'. Jack's father and mother were dead this long time, so I lived with uncle and Mattie at the farm. Mattie might have been married twice over if she had liked, and to folks that would have been quite a catch to a girl like her getting on in years. So what does he do, but he ups and offs to America (assisted emigration) 'to make his fortune,' says he. ""She must needs hanker after Jack, and that's why I say it's such nonsense,"" he says. ""He was taking his hundreds of pounds to the Bank every week in canvas bags, as all the world knew. She might have had young Bath for one, the. 'Mattie,' I calls out, 'here's a letter from that good-for-nothing fellow of yours' 'Don't tease me, Jane,' she says, 'for I do feel this morning as if I could hardly bear myself as it is' 'Here's the letter,' I say, 'and I'll take it down to. ""I remember the sun was so bright on the white paper that I could scarce see to read it over her shoulder, she not noticing me, nor anything else, any more"" ""She thanked me for bringing the letter, just as if I had anything to do with it, or any wish or will one way or another"" ""Then she opened the letter and seemed to forget all about me while she read it. She threw her arms round my neck and kissed me, and cried. 'I don't bear no malice over what your father said and done, but I'm not coming to his house' 'If you have forgot me, or think more of some other chap, don't let anything stand in the way of your letting me know it straight and plain' 'I am going to Liverpool on Thursday, and if we are to be married you will have to come to me there, for my business won't bear being left, and I must get back to it' 'You will come and meet me in the little ash copse, you know where'. 'I mean to take a wife back with me, Mattie, for I have done well, and can afford to keep one in better style than ever your father kept his' 'I am taking this way of seeing you because I don't want there to be any unpleasantness for you if you are tired of me or like some other chap better. So you had best look in there on your way up on Wednesday evening' 'Well?' says I, as she folded it up and unbuttoned two buttons of her dress to push it inside. 'He's come home again,' she. 'He's come home again, Jane, and it's all right, and he likes me just as much as ever he did, God bless him' 'And does he ask you to have him?' says I. 'Of course he does,' she says; 'I never thought any different. I never thought but what he would come back for me, just as he said he would--just as he has' 'Oh, well!' says I, 'all's well that ends well. I hope he's made enough to satisfy uncle. Mattie was like a different girl after Jack's return. She did her fair share of the work, but she did it with a face as long as a fiddle. She didn't seem to know any different, anyhow. One man's pretty much as good as another for that sort of thing. But I suppose that's all right. I'm so glad he's come back. I always say he would, if you remember.' She said, 'Yes, I do.' He replied, 'I always say I would, too'. On Wednesday afternoon she said to me, 'I'm going to meet Jack, and don't you say a word to the others about it, Jane' 'I'll tell father myself when I come back, if you'll get the tea like a good girl, and just tell them I've gone up to the village,' I says. She kissed me (she had got mighty fond of kissing these last few days), and ran upstairs to get ready. When she come down, she wasn't in her best dress as any other girl would have been. She had gone and put on a dowdy old green and white delaine that had been her Sunday dress, trimmed with green satin. 'What time was you to meet Jack?' I says. 'He didn't say,' said she; 'but it used to be half-past six' 'You're full early,' says I. 'Yes,' she says, 'but I've got to take the butter down to Weller's, and to call in for something first' 'Poor Mrs. Tibson's not so well, Polly,' I says to our maid. 'I've got a really good blue poplin laid by and a new bonnet with red roses in it, only come home. 'I'm going over to see her. Give the men their tea, will you? there's a good girl' 'I'm not sure what I'm going to do, but with an idea that all things somehow might work together for good to me if I only had the sense to see how, and turn things that way' 'And in ten minutes I was dressed, and nicely dressed too, for I had on my white frock and a pair of new gloves I had got out of my butter-money'. Jack was there, though it was before the time. He had a joke with her and lock her in, so she shouldn't meet him. ""I had turned the key in the lock softly, and stole off through the church. When I locked her in I only meant to have a sort of joke--at least, I think so,--but when I come close up to him and saw how well off he looked, and the diamond ring on his fingers, and his pin and his gold chain, I thought to myself -- I thought, 'Well, you go to Liverpool to-morrow, young man!' He stepped forward, with his hands held out to me, but when he saw it was me he stopped short. 'I hope you won't take it hard, Mr. Halibut,' says I, 'but she said she'd rather not come' 'Confound it!' says he. 'I was expecting quite a different person' 'I know,' I says, 'you was expecting my cousin Mattie' 'She told me to tell you she was sorry if you were mistaken in her feelings about you' 'Now you're so well off, she says she's sure you'll. 'I don't mean she said so in those words, or that she told me to tell you so; but that's what I made out to be her mind from what she said between us two like' 'It's not like her.' 'I suppose she sent you to meet me to-. 'Good God, don't be such an idiot!' says he. 'Don't be a fool, girl!' says I. 'Tell Jack there's at least one girl I know of as would make him a better wife than I should, and has been thinking of him steady and faithful these three years, while I've been giving my mind to far other things' 'I don't want to say no more,' says I, 'I'm going now, Mr. Halibut'. 'Tell me who it is,' says he. 'What! she's not content with giving me the mitten herself, but she must insult me and this poor girl too, who's got more sense than she has' 'Good Heavens, it would serve her right if I took her at her word. I was looking down my nose very straight, but when he said that, I just lifted my eyes up and looked at him, and dropped them. I've always practised looking like what I meant, or what I wanted people to think I meant--sort of matching your looks and words, like you match ribbon and a bit of stuff. I'm going to Liverpool to-night, and back to America next week. I want to take a wife with me, and she says you have thought of me while. 'Will you marry me, Jane?' he asked her. 'I just looked at him again, and he put his arm round me and gave me a good kiss' 'I had to put up with it, though I never could see any sense in that sort of stuff,' he said. 'Now, it would all have gone as well as well if I had had the sense to offer to see him off at the station' 'But we all make mistakes sometimes,' he added. 'We all make mistake after mistake'. 'I said 'Good-bye' to him, and he kissed me, and gave me the address where to write, and told me what to do' 'For I shan't have no truck with your uncle,' says he. 'I marries my wife, and I takes her right away' 'It wasn't till I was going up the stairs, untying my bonnet-strings as I went, and smoothing out the ribbons with my finger and thumb. 'O Lord!' I thought, 'she's tried every other way, and now she's ringing the bell, and she'll fetch up the whole village, and what will become of me?' 'I made the best haste I could, but I could see more than one black dot moving up the hill before me that showed me folks on their way home had heard the bell and were going to see what it meant' 'I thought maybe she would be trying some of the other doors, and I might turn the key gently. 'O Jack!' she cried, 'don't look like that' 'I came to fetch your letter, and somebody locked me in' 'It was only a joke!' says he. 'I don't know what you mean, I'm sure,' I said; 'it wasonly a joke' 'This is your doings,' says he, 'and all that pack of lies you told me was out of your own wicked head' 'That's the way it is,' says Jack. 'You can't. 'Oh, well!' I said, 'if you can't take joking better than this, it's the last time I'll ever try joking with you' 'Lies, I call it, and I know they're lies by the very touch of her in my arm here' 'I suppose it was only human nature that, as I come round the church, I should get on the top of a tombstone and look in to see what they was doing. It was the little window where a pane was broken by a stone last summer, and so I heard what they. 'What does it matter about a silly joke now that I have got you, and it's all right betwixt us?' he asked. 'God bless you, my boy, it was for your own good and hers,' his uncle replied. 'I should never have known how dear she has loved me this three year,' he added. 'As for me, I went to bed. I had had all the supper I wanted,' he said. 'And they went in to supper. And I went home and had all I wanted'. ""My uncle has never been the same to me since"

""But it will take more than that to wipe out my sins, and God forgive me if I can't always believe that even His mercy will be equal"". Whitecroft stands on a shoulder of the Downs, and on a clear day you can see right out to sea and over the hollow where Felscombe lies. He was a well-. Lilian and I had come there, little things, and uncle had brought us up together, and we loved each other like sisters until that happened. It was one wild windy night, when, if you should open the door an inch, everything in the house jarred and rattled.. Lilian and I were talking over our new winter dresses when there come a knock at the side door, not nigh so loud as some of the noises the wind made. In a minute it come again, and then I went to the door and opened it a bit. There was. 'Let the dog in, whatever he is, and let him tell his tale this side the oak' 'I had better have shut to the lid of my own coffin after me' 'There is something wrong with my arm--hollow--slip--light--hospital. 'This is a bad break. Which of you girls will go and wake one of the waggoners to fetch Doctor from Felscombe?' 'I will,' I said. But before I went I got out the port wine and the brandy, and bade Lilian rub. It seemed easier to take Brown Bess and go myself to Felscombe than to rouse the waggoners, who were but sleepy and slow-headed at the best of times. So I saddled Brown BESS myself and started. It was but a small way across the Downs. When we got in, we found Lilian kneeling by the sofa rubbing the young man's hands as I had told her to, and his eyes were open, and there was a bit of colour in his cheek, and he was looking at her like as any one but a fool might have known he would look. Oh yes! I might have married him if. Mr. Linley had a way with him like no other man I ever see; not only a way to please women with, but men too. I never saw my uncle so taken up with anybody. He stayed there a month, and we nursed him; and at the end of the month I knew no more than I. 'Lilian and I have made up our minds to take each other, with your consent, for better, for worse' 'I loved him as no woman will ever love you, sir, if you'll pardon.

I know what you have heard, but if I can't whiten myself without blacking a woman, I'll live and die as black as hell"". ""I don't need to tell you what I want to say,"" he says. ""I want you to know that I love you"" ""I don’t want to tell anyone what I’m going to say, but I want you all to know what I think"". 'I have always been a clean liver, and I have brought you up in the fear of the Lord,' he said. 'If she marries that scoundrel, she has my curse here and hereafter, and not one penny of my money'. Isabel's uncle Edgar sent her a letter asking for her to marry him. She was devastated and cried all day and most of the night. Edgar went to London to alter his will. Isabel and Lilian were left alone at Whitecroft. She couldn't bear to wake up of mornings and see her lying there.. ""I thought of Lilian upstairs in her white bed, and of how the day must come, when he would see how pretty she looked and white, and I said to myself, 'No, it never shall, not if I burn for it too' "" ""I hope you are understanding. ""I took all them faggots, dragging them across the sanded floor of the kitchen, and I put them in the parlour in the little wing to the left, and just under Lilian's bedroom"" ""I laid them under the wooden corner cupboard where the best china is, and then I poured oil and brandy. ""I made sure all was burning free, and out of the front door I went and up on to the Downs, and there. ""I saw the old house on fire, the dear old house, with Lilian inside it in her little white bed, being burnt to death, and me her murderer! And with that I got up, and I remember I was stiff, as if I had been screwing myself all close together to keep from knowing what it was I'd been a-doing. I ran. 'I opened her door--all red and glowing it was inside! like an oven when you open it to rake out the ashes on a baking-day. And I tried to get in, because all I wanted then was to save her--to get her out safe and sound, because we had been brought up together from little things, and I loved. The fire broke out in her room at her home in Brighton. She ran away to marry her young man and they are now married. She believes to this day the fire was an accident..

The clouds over the Mesa Grande were ominous, too. The storm was already marshaling its forces. The mail was in the saddle. The horse was in good condition. The town was two miles away. The road was hot. The air was charged with electricity. There was the storm, already marshaled its forces, and the storm was coming. The boy was 14. He had spent six years in Colorado. He knew what such weather foretold, and there were plenty of other signs of the approaching storm. He could see it.. Roy was certain that, after the month of rainless weather just passed, the coming deluge would be something to wonder at. Two hundred yards away a fringe of greasewood bushes marked what, at this distance, appeared to be a water course. But Roy had never seen more water in it than he could have jumped across. It was a narrow arroyo or gully, varying in width from twelve to twenty feet, and averaging fifteen feet in depth. It ran almost due north and south for a distance of five miles, through a bare, level prairie tenanted only by roving cattle and horses--if one excepts rabbits, prairie dogs, rattlesnakes, owls, lizards, and. The arroyo was ever a source of pleasure to Roy, with its twilit depths and firm sandy bed. He knew every inch of it. Many were the imaginary adventures he had gone through in its winding depths, now as a painted Arapahoe on the warpath. The arroya was a miniature gorge, tumbling and churning through the miniature Gorge, southward to the river. There was no vegetation except grease-wood, cactus, and sagebrush.. The arroyo is narrow and narrow, with only two places to enter or leave. The only way out of the canyon is to cross over to the other side, which is more open. The canyon is full of rocks, some of which have been used for centuries to build roads and bridges, and some of them are still in use today. There are also some old pottery fragments, including some of the world's oldest, that have been found in the canyon, dating back to the early 1800s. They were found by a man who was exploring the area, and he found them in a pile of rocks. He found a few of them, which he took to his home, and they are still there.. Roy and Scamp clambered carefully down the narrow path to the bottom of the arroyo. On both sides the walls of adobe and yellow clay rose as straight as though of masonry. Above, all was blackness save when for an instant a wide, white sheet of lightning blazed above the mesa. ""We are going to get good and wet before we get home,"" muttered Roy. ""Come on, Scamp!"" They reached the edge of the Arroyo and the little pony, lurching from side to side, clambled carefully down.. Roy took off his hat and let the little draught of air that blew through the chasm dry the perspiration on his face and hair. Presently the sunlight above gave way to a sullen, silent shadow. The air grew strangely quiet; even the lizards no longer moved. Roy gazed straight upward into the slowly rolling depths of a dark cloud. He had seen many a storm; but the one that was approaching now made him almost afraid. The little twigs of greasewood shivered and bent, and a cool breath fanned his cheek. There came a great drop, splashing against his bare brown hand; then another; then many, each leaving a spot of moisture on the dry sand as big as a silver dollar.. Roy rode Scamp through the rain. He was drenched ere he could have turned in his saddle. He buttoned his blue-flannel shirt at the throat, patted Scamp encouragingly on his reeking neck, and rode on. The bed of the arroyo was running with water and the softened sand made heavy going. The rain fell in livid, hissing sheets and walls, taking strange shapes, like pillars and columns that came from a dim nowhere and rushed past him into the gray void behind. The thunder had been roaring at intervals, drawing nearer and nearer, and now it crashed directly overhead with a mighty sound that shook the earth and sent Scamp bounding out of his path.. Roy could scarcely distinguish the walls on either side; but he knew that when the storm had broken the path leading up out of the arroyo was about a half mile ahead of him. The walls, running with mud, were crumbling and falling here and there in miniature landslides. Scamp was plunging badly in the soft ground, and so Roy slowed him down to a trot. He could not, he told himself grimly, get one speck wetter. With sudden recollection of his bundles, Roy glanced back. Only a wisp of wet brown paper sticking to the cantle remained; the water had soaked the wrappings--baking powder, flavoring extract, dried fruit, and all the rest of it, had disappeared.. Roy saw a wave of turbid, yellow water, bearing above it a great rolling bank of white froth. He knew on the instant what had happened. There had been a cloud-burst on the mesa or among the foothills. The nearest place of refuge was a mile and a half away. On his courage and coolness rested his chance for life. The boy's life was on the line. He would not be drowned like a rat. He had to fight for his life. His life depended on it. He fought for it. The flood would not drown him. He could not be killed. He was not a rat, but a man. He must fight. He ran. He fell into the water. He drowned. He died.. Roy lashed Scamp with the dripping quirt. Urging was unnecessary, for it seemed the horse knew that Death was rushing along behind them. He raced as Roy had never seen him run before. The walls rushed by, dim and misty. In a minute Boy gathered courage to glance back over his shoulder. His heart sank--only a yard or two behind them rushed the foam-topped wave. Here and there the sides of the arroyo melted in the flood and toppled downward, yards at a time, sending the yellow water high in air, but making no sound above its roaring. He wondered what death by drowning was like. The nearest way out was still a full mile distant. Roy used the quirt ruthlessly, searching the banks.. Roy wondered what his mother would do without him to fetch the water from the cistern back of the kitchen. He wondered, too, if they would ever find his body--and Scamp's! The thought that poor, gallant old Scamp must die too struck him as the hardest thing of all. He loved Scamp as he loved none else save father and mother; they had had their little disagreements, when Scamp refused to come to the halter in the corral and had to be roped, but they always made up, with petting and sugar beets from Roy and remorseful whinnies from Scamp. And now Scampmust be drowned!. Roy's horse, Scamp, fell into the chasm. Roy kicked his feet from the stirrups and sprang blindly toward the bank. He sank downward inch by inch, his crooked fingers bringing the moist clay with them. The muddy water splashed into his face, blinding, choking him. But the object within his grasp remained firm. For a moment he swung there, gasping, with closed eyes. He felt better, somehow, and when the second wave caught them, almost bearing Scamp from his sturdy feet, he looked calmly about him. He had made up his mind to give Scamp a chance for life. He tossed aside his quirt, patted the wet neck of the plunging animal and whispered a choking ""Good-by"" The water swept him outward then, tearing at his writhing legs. Just as his last clutch failed him his other hand. The water was rising rapidly. Scamp was no longer in sight. All about him the walls, undermined by the flood, were slipping down in wet, crumbling masses. He wondered if the root would hold him, and prayed that it might. Then the water came up to his breast, and he knew that if he were to save himself he must manage somehow to crawl upward. Perhaps--perhaps he might even climb quite out of the chasm! If only the earth and the root will hold! He took a deep breath and tried his weight upon it. It held like a rope. He pulled himself a foot higher from the waters. Once more, and then he found that he had command of his legs and could dig his feet into the unstable clay. Then, inch by inch, scarce daring to hope, he pulled himself up, up until he was free of the flood. The author spent hours clinging to the edge of the bank, trying to free himself from the rushing torrents of the Arroyo de Arquibancadas. He eventually fell over the brink and rolled fainting to the rain-soaked ground, where he lay until a tremor of the earth roused him. The author then ran away from the arroyo just as the bank disappeared behind him, for yards behind him. He later wrote a book about his experiences, called ""The Adventures of a Lost Boy"" The book is published by Simon & Schuster, priced £16.99. For more information on the book, visit www.simonandschuster.com.. ""When Scamp came in, wet and almost dead, we feared you were gone."" They were sitting about the supper table. Roy had told his story to a wondering audience, and now, with his plate well filled with mother's best watermelon preserve and citron cake, he was supremely contented. After that he struggled onward through the driving rain until he sank exhausted to the ground, burying his head in his arms. They put him into the wagon of the nearest rancher and jolted him home. He was fast asleep. ""I don't reckon I'll ever have the heart again to grub one of 'em up,"" his father says. ""I can't see how that broncho ever got out of there alive,"" he adds. ""And to think,"" he added wonderingly"

I don't know how she could have done it. I. She was walking regular with a steady young man, who worked through the week at Hastings, and come home here on a Sunday. She would have married him and been as happy as a queen, I know. But it was not to be.. The author's father, a shoemaker, was a pious man, very pious, and not saying much as he sat at his bench. He would hum a hymn or two at his work sometimes, but he was never a man of words. When young Barber went back to London, Ellen, she began to lose her. A month after young Barber left, Ellen left a note on father's bench to say she was going to be married. Father didn't say a word, but he turned a dreadful white, and blue his lips were, and for one dreadful moment I thought that I had lost him too.. 'How can I believe in all that, and my Ellen gone to shame?' she asked her father. 'O father! come to church. Happen it's all true, and Ellen's an honest woman, after all.'. 'I'm very tired,' says Ellen, leaning against the door-post; 'I have come from a very long way' And father, he looked at her like a man that sees nothing, and I was frightened what he. 'When you name that name, my girl, you light hell in me, and if ever I see his damned face again, God help him and me too' 'And so. When the baby was born, Ellen's godmother asked, 'Is it a boy or a girl?' and we told her it was a boy. 'Thank God for that! My baby won't live to know such shame as mine,' she said. ""I want to say ""good-bye"" to it, for I shall never go where it is going"" ""I had dressed the poor little thing--. 'Let Lucy take the poor little thing away, Ellen,' he says, 'for you must try to get well and strong for the sake of those that love you' 'I know what. 'I laid her out, my pretty, with my own hands, and the baby in the hollow of her arm' 'Perhaps if I hold it tight we'll go out into the dark together, and God won't have the heart to part us' 'And so she died'. Father didn't grieve and take on as some men do, but he was quieter than he used to be. It seemed as if the spring of him was broken, somehow. Not but what he was goodness itself to me then and always. But I wasn't his favourite child, nor could I. 'I think maybe there's a God, and if there is, I have that in my heart that's quite enough keeping in my own poor house, without my daring to take it into His'. For when Ellen died it could not be kept secret any longer, and a heap of folks that would have drawn their skirts aside rather than brush against her if she had been there alive and well, with her baby at her breast, had a tear and a kind word for her now that she was gone.. ""It isn't true of fathers and sisters that God forgets any one in His mercy, it will be him and his like!"". ""It all happened in a flash. It all happened ... like a rabbit when the dogs are on it, and it can't find no way out"" ""I saw Barber come running up the dusty road in his black, and passed me as I stood by the churchyard gate.

When I come to be grown up and took a husband of my own it was a bargeman I took. He was a good sort always, was my Tom, though not particular about Sundays and churchgoings.. Tom and I worked the William and Mary, did Tom and me, and I used to think no one could be 'appier than we was them first two years. But after two years we got a little baby of our own, and then I knew as I hadn't known what 'appiness was before. Tom was as kind as kind, and never said a hard word to me except when he was in liquor; and as to liftin' his 'and to me, no, never in his life.. My mother had married beneath her, they said, for she'd been to school and been in service in a good family. She taught me to read and write and cipher in the old days, when I was a little kid along of 'er in the barge. She was such a. When Mary was eight year old her great-uncle left us a bit of money. 'Not a penny of it shall I spend,' says my Tom when he heard of it. 'We'll send our Mary to school with that, we will; and happen she'll be a lady's-maid and get on in the world'. 'Don't you fret, old woman,' says Tom, with the tears standin' in his eyes, 'she's better off where she is, and she'll thank us for it some day some day' 'I felt it too though I couldn. ""She's 'appier where she is,' says 'e, 'nor she would be in this dirty old barge along of us' "" "" She'd run all the way from Maidstone in 'er little nightgown, and a waterproof over it.

""I'm goin' back 'e says 'e won't be no weddin' to-day; 'e shan't 'ave 'er now,' says my old man. And with that 'e catches 'e of Mary in one and and me in the other, and turns to go out of church. And at the door, 'e finds it to be my mother, 'er that I'd called a cat in my wicked spite only the day before."". 'God forgive 'im,' says she, 'I never could, for all he's my own son. He's gone off for a soldier, and 'e left a letter sayin' you wasn't to think any more of 'im, for 'e wasn't a marryin' man' 'It's that dam money,' says my goodman, forgettin' 'e was in church; 'that was all 'e wanted.

'Whose else's would it be?' says he. 'ain't it enough to deceive a girl, and desert her, without throwing mud in her face on the top of it all?' 'I'll marry you to-morrow, if you like, and be a father to the kid,' says Mary.. 'I'd rather have things as they are, than have married you in church and 'ave found out afterwards what a cowardly beast you are' 'I'm as honest as I want to be,' says she, 'and the child is all my own now.' So no more was said. 'I think, perhaps,' says I afterwards, 'you ought to 'ave let 'ave made an honest woman of you' ''I'm not a man, I'm a woman,' she says. 'And a woman is a woman. And a woman's a woman.'. Tom Allbutt was a sailor on a ship off Maidstone, Kent. He met Bill Jarvis, a young man who was dying of typhoid fever. The pair went to the hospital to see Bill before he died. Bill was so changed you wouldn't 'ardly 'ave known 'im' He had gone from being a fleshy, red-cheeked young fellow, to being as thin as a skeleton, and 'is eyes seemed to fill half 'is face'. 'I'm dying, I can't do her and the kid no 'arm now, and I should die easier if she'd marry me here,' says Bill. 'So help me God, I never knew what a beast I was till that day I come to you in your barge and you showed me what a man was, Tom Allbutt,' he says. 'I've been trying to be a man ever since, and ... I've given up the drink, and... I've lived steady, and never so much as looked at another girl. 'Oh, get her to be my wife,' says 'e, 'and let me die easy' The doctor says it was Mary saved his life, for it was after he had had a little talk with her that he took a turn for the better. But he didn't die, he got better, and there isn't a couple happier than him and Mary, for all they've gone through. 'I've been a bad lot, and you was in the right when you called me a coward and a beast; but your father showed me what. 'Love you when you're gone?' says she, cryin' all over 'er face, and kissin' 'im as if it was for a wager. 'Why, I've loved you all the time!' she says. '"

When he was nigh upon 14, and was to go away to his uncle in Somerset to learn farming, he gave me a kiss and half of a broken sixpence, and said -- 'Kate, I shall never think of any girl but you, and you must never thought of any chap but me.' Father and mother laughed a bit, and called it child's nonsense; but they was willing enough for all that, for William was a likely chap, and would be well-to-do when his good father died, which I am sure I never wished nor prayed for. All the trouble come from his going to Somerset to learning farming, for his uncle that was there was a Roman, and he taught William a. 'I had rather see you laid out on the best bed upstairs than I'd see you married to William, a son of the Scarlet Woman' 'You've got to give him up, my girl. You write and tell him so, and I'll take the letter as I go down to the church to-night to practice' 'I was a-crying on to my bread-and-butter, and mother sniffing a little for company behind the tea-tray, and father, he bangs down his fist in a way to make the cups rattle again, and he says-- 'You're getting married to him!'. 'You wouldn't have any chance in the next, I'm afraid, James,' said my mother gently, 'for her poor soul, it couldn't hope to go to the blessed place after that' 'I should hope not,' said his father, and with that he got up and went out, half his tea not drunk left in the mug. 'I told William right enough that him and me could never be anything but friends, and that he must think of me as a sister, that was what father. ""I will live an old maid to the end of my days rather than take up with any other chap,"" she writes. ""That was the saddest summer ever I had,"" she adds. ""I really did give father that same letter to post, and him believing me to be a better girl than I was"" ""I hope it wasn't very wrong of me to put in a little bit of my own, and this is what I said after I had told him about the friend and sister,"" she says. ""And may I be forgiven the deceitfulness, and what I may call the impudence of it! "". Everything seemed to go wrong. The butter was twice as long a-coming as ever I knowed it. The broad beans got black fly, and father lost half his hay with the weather. Even the little chickens, I thought them a bother, and--it goes to my heart to say it--a whole sitting was eaten by the rats in consequence. But, of course, I knew better than to speak up to my own father, with his hay lying rotting and smoking in the ten-acre, and telling him he was a-being judged. It was neither here nor there. I've seen better years and I have seen worse. And October come October come. ""I was getting to bed one night; at least, I hadn't begun to undress, for I was sitting there with William's letters"" ""I was reading them over and thinking of William, silly fashion, as a young girl will, and wishing it had been me was a Roman Catholic and him a Protestant"" ""And then I hears a scratch, scratch, scratching, and 'Drat the mice,' says I; but I didn't take any notice, and then there was a little tap, tapping, like a bird would make with its beak on the window-pane""""I went and opened it, thinking it was a bird that had lost its way and was coming foolish-. 'Oh, go, dear William, do go,' says I. 'I couldn't for the life of me for the moment think of any place where I could meet William' 'I'm not going,' says William, 'till you tell me where you'll meet me to say ""Good-bye"" and ""God bless you,"" like you said in the letter' 'Oh, I'm so glad you're here,' I say, 'I've been waiting for you all day' 'Yes, I am,' he says, 'but I'm going to go now'. 'Oh! it's father got round. Oh! he'll kill you, William' 'Nonsense!' said William, and he caught hold of my shoulder and gave me a gentle little shake. 'It was only one of these pears as I kicked off. They must be as hard as iron to fall like that' 'Then I'll meet you by the Parson's Shave at half-past five, and do go' 'My heart's a-beating so I can hardly hear myself speak,' said William.. The next day I went about my work as frightened as a rabbit, and my heart beating fit to choke me, trying not to think of what I had promised to do. I thought every minute some one would be coming in to see what was happening. Father had brought me up careful and kind, and I knew my duty to my parents. But I couldn't help thinking I owed a little bit of a duty to William. I meant doing that, so far as keeping my promise to meet him that afternoon went. I knew well enough it wasn't honest; but he hadn't got my word.. After tea I says, and I do think it is almost the only lie I ever told, 'I've got the jumping toothache, and it's that bad I can hardly see to thread my needle' Then she says, as I knew she would, her being as kind an old soul as ever trod: 'Go and lie down a bit and put the old sheepskin coat over your head, andI'll get on with the darning' So I went upstairs trembling all over. I took the bolster and pillow and put them under the covers, to look as like me as I could. Then I took my hat and shawl and I went out, quiet as a mouse, through the dairy. When I got to the. 'Why not go up there and sit in the porch? See, it's coming on to rain' 'So we stole on our tiptoes round to the little door that is hardly ever fastened, and so through to the tower' 'I was sorry I'd come, for I heard feet on the road below, and they stopped outside the lychgate' 'If I am going to give you up to please father, I may as well please him all round' 'There's no reason why he should know I've seen you.' 'There was no way I was going to let him know I'd seen him'. ""I was just going to tell him again what I had said in the letter about being his sister and a friend, which seemed to comfort me somehow,"" she writes. ""But when William, he gripped my hand like iron, and ''S-sh!' says he, 'listen' And I listened, and oh! what I felt when I heard footsteps coming up the tower"" ""I didn't dare speak a word to him, and only kept tight. 'If you hear them bells when they're all a-going, you won't never hear much else,' said William. 'We must get on up out of it unless we want to be deaf the rest of our lives' The owls and starlings were frightened, I suppose, at hearing us, though why they should have been, I don't know, being used to the bells. They flew about round us liker ghosts than anything feathered, and one great owl flopped out right into my face, till I nearly screamed again' 'Oh, what's my head made of, to forget that it's practising night? and Him the church was built for only knows how long they won't be. The pair had to climb up the tower to get to the top of the tower. They had to go on hands and knees to avoid being hit by the bells. It was a long way up and back, and they had to be careful not to hit each other. But they managed to get up the stairs and reach the top in half an hour. The pair then had to get down the ladder to the belfry to get back to the tower top. It took them about an hour to climb down the tower and get back up the ladder.. ""I thought we should never get there, and oh! what it was to me when I came to the end of the last beam, and got my foot down on the firm floor again, and the ladder in my hand, and. William Shakespeare's play ""The Tempest"" was set in London in 17th century England. The play is about the life of a young man who becomes a playwright. Shakespeare's character, Henry VIII, was a member of the Royal Family. He was the son of King Edward VII, and the son-in-law of King George III. The novel was written by Shakespeare's son, Henry VII, who died in 1776. The story was based on the play's author's experiences in the Tower of London and the surrounding area. It was written in the first half of the 19th century. The book was published in 1780.. 'I'll wait for you all my life long,' says William. 'Not that I wish the old man any harm, but it's not in the nature of things your father can live for ever, and then--' 'It ain't no use thinking of that, William,' said I. 'Father is sure to make me promise never to have you--when he's dying, and I can't refuse him anything' 'I said I knew my duty, and he said he hoped I would think better of it,' said the boy. 'No, never,' and then we kissed each other again, and the bells went on, and on.. 'Well,' says William, 'you'll give me up, but I'll never give you up; and you mark my words, you and me will be man and wife some day' 'And as he said it, the bells stopped sudden in the middle of a change. The rain had come on again. It was very chill up there. My teeth was chattering, and so was William's, though he pretended he did it for the joke' 'Let's get inside again,' says he. 'Perhaps they are going home, and if they are not, we can stay there till they begin it again' 'It's just the kind of thing he'd think of.' 'It was enough to drive one distracted'. ""I don't believe it,' he was shouting. 'It can't be true. She's a God-fearing girl,' he said. ""Come home, James,' she said, 'come home--it's true. I told you you was too hard on them' "" ""I told you, James, I toldYou you wastoo hard on their. Young folks will be young folks, and now, perhaps, our little girl has come to shame. 'I can't think but what I'm dreaming,' he said. 'I hain't got no daughter' 'I'd turn her out of doors' 'Don't curse them, James' 'She's no daughter o' mine' 'God forgive them both!' 'I'm going to kill her' 'No, I'm not!' 'You're going to shoot her!' 'She'll be dead in a few minutes' 'Yes, I am,' he says. 'She will be dead' 'But she'll be alive in a minute' 'Oh,. 'She'd best not come back,' said the leader, John Evans. 'You'll be sorry for it, and they'll have trouble enough without that' 'I don't believe no harm of that gal,' says Jim Piper at the general shop. 'No more nor I would of my own missus, nor yet of him' 'Well, let's hope for the best,' said other ringers. 'I had a sort of feeling they was hoping for the worst' 'When things goes wrong, it's always more amusing for the lookers-on than when everything goes right'. 'Good-bye, William. I'm going home,' I says. 'Yes, my girl,' says he, 'you're going home with me to my mother' And he was masterful enough then, I can tell you. He won't be as hard as his word, and if I couldn't give you all my life to be a good wife to you, I have given you my character, it seems; not willing, it's true; but there's nothing I should grudge you, William, and I. 'If your father would throw you off without knowing the rights or wrongs of the story, it's not for him you should be giving up your happiness and mine, my girl,' he said. 'Come home to my mother, and let me see the man who dares to say anything against my wife' 'I didn't say another word, only began to cry, and we got downstairs and straight home to William's mother,and we told her all about it,' she said. ""We was cried in church next Sunday, and I stayed with the old lady until we was married, and many a year after"". When I was churched after my first, and the boy was christened--in our own church, for I had made William promise it should be so if ever we had any--mother was there, and she said to me: 'Take the child,' she said, 'and go to your father at home; and when he sees the child, he'll come round, I'll lay a crown' For his bark,' she says, 'was allus worse than his bite.' And I did so, and I went into the kitchen, and there was father sitting in his big chair, and. the Bible on the table in front of him, with his spectacles; but he wasn. 'Look, father, here's our little baby; and he's named James, for you, father' 'I know what it is to have a child of your own go against your wishes, and please God mine never will--or against yours either. But I couldn't help it, and O father, do forgive me!' 'It's 'most time your mother was home from church. Won't you be setting the tea, Kate?' 'Yes, I will,' says Kate, 'and I'll make it a good one'. ""I think when father is taken from us--which in the nature of things he must be, though long may it be first--I think I shall be a Roman Catholic too,"" she says. ""It doesn't seem to me to matter much one way or the other, and it would please William very much, and I"

She says she learned a lot about gentlefolks and what they can't abide. The worst of being housemaid where there's a lot of servants kept is, that one or other or all of the men-servants is sure to be wanting to keep company with you. The coachman was promised to the cook, which, I believe, often takes place.. ""They tell me I was a pretty girl enough in those days, though looks is less important than you might think to a housemaid, if only she dresses neat and has a small waist. And I suppose I must think that John really did love me in his scowling, black whiskery way. But whatever he might have thought, I never would have had anything to do with him, even if James and me had had seas between us broad a-rolling"". Mr. Oliver was the funniest-looking old gent I ever see, if I may say so respectfully. He was as bald as an egg, with a sort of frill of brown hair going from ear to ear behind. And as if that wasn't enough, he was shaved as clean as a whistle.. ""He wrote books, a great many of them, and you may often see his name in the papers, and he was for ever poking about into what didn't concern him,"" writes the author. ""He certainly talked to every one he came across--even the stable-boys--in a way that you could hardly think becoming from a gentleman to servants, if he wasn't an author, and so to have allowances made for him, poor man! "". Mrs. Oliver was a round little fat bunch of a woman, if I may say so in speaking of master's own aunt by marriage, and him a baronet. She had the most lovely jewellery, and was very fond of wearing it of an evening, more than most people do when they are staying with relations and there's no company.. James was the jolliest man I ever met, and cook said the same. He was like Sam Weller in the book, or would have been if he had lived in those far-off times; but footmen are more genteel now than they were then. cook made him a Welsh rabbit with her own hands, 'cause he hadn't been able to get his dinner. 'You don't know how I love you, Mary,' he says. 'You are my business--the only business I care a damn about, or am ever likely to' 'You've met your master, I'm thinking'; and if I did go to church with him the very first Sunday, which was more than ever I had done with any of the others, it was after he had asked me plain and straight to go with him some day.. 'I would lie down in the dirt for you to walk on if it would do you any good, so long as you didn't walk over me to get to some other chap,' says I. 'Oh! you think he'll marry you, do you?' says he. 'But he's just amusing himself with you till he gets back to London to his own girl' 'It's all a lie!' I cried; 'and I wonder you can look me in the face and tell it'. 'If you don't let go of my hands, I'll scream till I fetch the house down, master and all, and then where will you be?' 'I never want to speak to you again,' he said. 'But I tell you, you won't marry him, and you'll find. 'Before that happens, you'll have to change him into a liar and me into a fool and yourself into an honest man, and you'll find that the hardest of all,' says I. And with that I threw the dusting-brush at him--which was a piece of wicked temper I oughtn't to have given way to--and ran out of the door, and I heard him cursing to himself something fearful as I went down the passage.. 'Oh, what ever shall I do?' she cried, wringing her hands, as they say in books, and I always thought it nonsense, but she certainly did, though I never saw any one do it before or since. 'It's my mistress's diamond necklace,' she said. 'She was going to wear it to-night. And then she said, No, she wouldn't; she'd have the emeralds' 'I left. Mr. Oliver had a heap of jewellery that had come to her from her own people, and she as fond of wearing it as if she was slim and twenty, instead of being fifty, and as round as an orange. We looked on the dressing-table and we looked on. the floor, and we looking in the curtains to see if it had got in any of them. But look high,. 'Hullo! Scott,' he says, 'have you seen a ghost?' And, indeed, she looked more dead than alive. She gulped in her throat, but she could not speak. All the house was turned out of window, hunting for the necklace; though, of course, not having legs, it couldn't have walked by itself out.. 'Do they think we'd take their dirty necklace?' he said, as we were going up. 'It's enough to ruin all of us' 'I am sure I am only expressing the feelings of my fellow-servants' 'We should wish our boxes searched and our rooms, so that there shall be no chance for any one to say afterwards that it lays at any of our doors' 'And Mrs. Oliver began to cry, and she said 'No, no, she wouldn't put that insult on any one'. 'The young man is quite right, my dear,' he says to master, 'I think it had better be done' They came to my room and they looked into all my drawers and boxes except my little hat-tin. I said, silly-like, not having any idea that they could think that I could do such a thing. It's only some things I don't want any one to see.'. Mary's story is told in a book called ""The Lost Girl"" The story was written by Mary Oliver, wife of William Oliver, who died in 18th century England. The book was published in 1828 by William Shakespeare's son William, and was published by William & Mary. The story is about the death of William's wife, Mary, and her husband's death.. 'I should think it's like being had up for murder, standing there in the library with all the servants holding off from me as if I had got something catching,' he writes. 'I could not think, though I tried hard--I could only feel as if i was drowning and fighting for breath' 'I never touched it, sir,' he says, 'I don't know who did; and may God forgive them'. 'Speak up, girl,' he said, 'speak up' 'I'm a-going to be married, my Lady, and it was bits of things I'd got towards my wedding clothes' 'O my God, strike me down dead, for live I can't after this!' 'I wanted the money to start in a little pub,' he added. 'I wish to confess that I took it, and I put it. 'The thing was found in my box, sir, and I'll take the consequences if I have to be hanged for it. But don't you believe a word James says. He never touched it. It wasn't him' 'If you felt to a young man like I feel to James, you'd know in your heart that he could not have done such a thing, not if there was fifty diamond necklaces found in fifty pockets on him at the same time'. 'I'm as sure he didn't do it as I am that I didn't,' she said. 'You send me off to prison as soon as you like, sir.' 'Bravo!' he says, 'bravo! I'm so proud of you, James' 'God bless him for it,' she replied. 'Instead of believing that I could do such a thing, and trying to save me with a black lie--God bless his for it'. John was told by Mr. Oliver that he had threatened to kill Mary if she married James. 'I heard you threaten that she should never marry James,' he said. 'And that you would be revenged on her for her bad taste in preferring him to you.' John drew a deep breath and said: 'I know it's true without that' Mr.Oliver tapped his snuff-box and grinned all over his big smooth face.. Mr. Oliver got up and put his snuff-box on the table, and his hands in his trouser pockets. 'That's nothing, sir, is it?' he says to master. 'Every one in the house knows I have been sorry for a hasty word, and have been the best friends with both of them for these three weeks' 'You can send for the police, William,' he said to master, 'because as a matter of fact, I saw the black-whiskered gentleman. 'You know everything, you do,' says John, growing very white, and speaking angry and quick. 'I knew that smooth-spoken man of yours would believe anything against her, and I knew he would never marry her after a set-out like this. I knew I should get her when she found I stuck to her through it all, as I should have done, and as I would have done too, if she had taken fifty diamond necklaces.'. He turned to go like a dog that has been whipped, but at the door he faced round, and he said to Mrs. Oliver, 'You're a good woman, and I'm sorry I said what I did about you. But for the other I'm not sorry, not if it was my last word.' He was found next morning on the level-crossing after the down express had passed. He had no relations and he had no friends, and so it happened that was truly his last. ""I don't think any one ever made a better match. James says he made abetter match, and if I don't agree with him, it's only right and proper that he should think so"" ""I thank God that he does every hour of my life"" ""He oughtn't to have doubted me."" ""I wouldn't name the day"""

I had never been out to service before, and I thought it a grand thing when I got a place at Charleston Farm. Old Mr. Alderton was close-fisted enough, and while he had the management of the farm it was a place no girl need have wished to come to. Mr. Alderton had given up farming this year or two, and young Master Harry, he had. 'Are you Deresby's Poll?' says he. 'Yes; what might you be wanting?' 'We want a good maid up at the farm,' says he, patting his horse's neck. 'Steady, old boy--and they tell me you're a good girl that wants a good place' 'Tuesday, if that would be convenient,' I said. 'No king could have looked handsomer,' he replied. 'Charleston is a lonesome kind of house' 'Yes, it is,' I replied.. The housekeeper at the home of Mr. Blake was a widow. She had been housekeeper there since the old mistress died. No one knew where she came from, or what had become of her. The house is bare and white, except on one side where the big pond is. It's lying as it does, in the cup of the hill, it seems to shut loneliness in and good company out. It is a beautiful house, but it is also lonely and lonely. It has a lot of black jet and crape to set it off.. I have heard it said she was handsome, and so she may have been; and she took a deal of care of her face, always wearing a veil when there was a wind, and her hands to have gloves, if you please, for every bit of dirty work. But she was a capable woman, and she soon put me in the way of my work; and me and Betty, who was a little girl of fourteen from Alfreston, had most of the housework to do, for Mrs. Blake would let none of us do a hand's-turn for the old. ""I'm not one to grudge a hand's-turn here or a hand’s-turn there, and I was happy enough,"" she said. ""But I never understood what it was all about,"" she added, ""and indeed I shouldn't. It's a mystery to me. I don't know what it is, but it's not a mystery."" ""It's like a puzzle,"" she replied. ""I can't figure out how to solve it. I'm trying to figure it out. I just don't understand it."" ""I'm trying not to understand it, but I can't,"" she admitted. ""It just seems like a mystery. I can’t understand it. It�. 'You think to catch a man with those?' she said. 'No, I don't. But it isn't fine feathers as they say. Don't you believe it?' 'I don't,' he replied. 'I've got them all. You're the only one who has them.' 'I'm not. I've got the rest of them,' she said, 'and I'm going to get them all.' 'Yes, you have,' he said, and she went off to get more. 'But I'm not going to give them to you,' he added. 'You're the one who got them.'. When Mrs. Blake heard he was going, she said she would take the opportunity of his being away to ask him for a day's holiday to go and visit her friends in Ashford. So she and master went in the trap to the station together, and off by the same train. When they come back, I thought to myself, 'That's like your artfulness, Mrs.Blake' 'You know well enough who my choice is. I haven't lived in the house with you six months without finding out there's only one girl as I should like to keep my house to the end of the chapter' 'I don't know what maggot has bit you, sir, to think of such nonsense'. 'And as for my father,' says he, 'I know he's ideas above what's fitting for farmer folk, but I know best what's the right choice for me' 'And I hope I did what was right, though it was with a sore heart, for I said--' 'I couldn't stay on in your folks' house to have secret understandings with you, Master Harry,' says Mrs. Blake. 'That ain't to be thought of. That ain't. to be. thought of.' 'And you shall be mistress of the farm when the poor old dad's time comes to go,' says Harry. 'Not that I wish his time nearer by an hour, for all I love you so dear, Polly.'. ""I should have dropped the tea-tray, but for me being brought up, and taught always to hold on to theTea-Tray with all my fingers"" ""I'm proud to say I didn't say a word, but I walked into the kitchen with my ear as hot as fire and my temper to match, which was no wonder and no disgrace"" ""You go this day month, Miss, 'a-listening at doors when your betters is a-talking,' she says, 'and I'll tell you what. I'll say it to your face, and you'll. 'I'll teach you!' says she, and back she goes into the parlour. 'But I took no notice of what she said, for Master Harry, he hired me, and I would take no notice from any one but him' 'My brother John never did get on with father, but when all's mine, we'll see that John don't starve' 'Long may he wear them! But father's told me he has left everything to me, right and safe, though I am the second son' 'And that day week old master was a corpse'. The will was to be read in the parlour after the funeral. Mr. Sigglesfield was there, and some of the relations, who had come a long way to hear if they was to pull anything out of the fire. Master Harry was there. And says he, 'I suppose the will's got to beread, but my father, he told me what I was to expect. It's all to me, and one hundred to Mrs. Blake, and five pounds apiece to the servants' And Mr. Sigglesfied was there too. And he said he was sorry for Master Harry, who was a good son, and quite broken down.. 'So I think,' says Mrs. Blake, tossing her head and rubbing her red eyes with her handkerchief. 'I think the will had better be read, Mr. Alderton' 'Who in hell,' he says, 'is his wife Martha?' 'That's me,' she said, 'by your leave; married two months come Tuesday, and here's my lines' 'And there they were. There was no getting over them. Married at St. Peter's' 'I don't understand your cursed lawyer's lingo. Does this mean that my father has left me fifty pounds, and has left the rest, stock, lock and barrel, to. 'O you wicked old Jezebel!' says Master Harry, shaking his fist at her. 'Here's a fine end for a young man's hopes! Is it true?' says he, turning to the lawyer. 'I am afraid so, my poor fellow,' says Mr. Sigglesfield. 'Never mind the dirty money,' says I, 'never mind thedirty money' And Harry turned and went without a word. Then I slipped out too, and I snatched my old bonnet and shawl off their peg in the kitchen.. ""I'll work my fingers to the bone for you,"" he says. ""We're better off than her when all's said and done"" ""I've never been happier than when I'm with you,"" she says, ""and I'll never be happier again."" ""I'm not going to let you down,"" he replies. ""I'll always love you."" ""We'll always have each other,"" she adds. ""And I'll always be with you"" ""Yes,"" he responds. ""But I'm going to have to work for it."". 'They were married right enough,' he said. 'I put that in my pocket and said nothing to father' 'I was able to get my bits of things together comfortable without her fussing and interfering' 'There was a pair of scissors of mine I couldn't find, and I looked for them high and low till I remembered that I had lent them to Mrs. Blake the week before.' 'I found something else that I hadn't been looking for,' he says. 'And so we went home and sat down to wait for Harry' 'He came in by the last train, looking tired and gloomy,' says the author.. 'I've seen the register, and I've saw the clerk, and he remembers them being married,' says the postman. 'Then you'd better have a bit of supper, my boy,' says mother, and takes it smoking hot out of the oven' 'Well, Polly,' says he, 'times do change' 'I've never been so happy in my whole life' 'It's like I've been given a second chance at life,' says my mother. 'I'm going to make the most of it'. The letter was registered and with a London postmark. The postman was smoking a pipe in the chimney-corner. He was as surprised as me at getting a letter with aLondon postmark, and registered too. He kept turning it over and over, and wondering who it could have come from, till we thought it would be the best way to open and see, and we did. They tell me young Alderton is biding with your folks now,' says the letter.. 'I have made a few inquiries about the movements of our lamented father and Mrs. Blake on the day when they were united, and if the same will be agreeable to you, I will come down Sunday morning and talk matters over with you.' 'P.S. Telegraph if you would like me to come.' 'Well, we telegraphed, though mother doesn't hold with such things, looking on it as flying in the face of Providence and what's natural' 'I remain, my dear brother, your affectionate brother, and will always be your brother.' 'I shall register the letter'. Harry met him at the station and brought him home, and when he come in he kissed me like a brother, and mother too, and he said--'The best good of trouble, ma'am, is to show you who your friends really are' The story of Harry and John's reconciliation was told in a book called 'Punch and Harry' published by Simon & Schuster. The book, which is published by Macmillan, is out now and is available in hardback for £16.99.. 'He's got a pair of hands, and so has my Polly, and he might have chosen worse, though I says it' 'We leaned against a grey gate and talked it all over' 'Look here, Polly, we aren't to have any secrets from you' 'He might have picked a better name for you than me'. John's wife was not with him when she went to get arsenic from the chemist's. He found out by a piece of luck once as doesn't come to a man every day of the week. He said it was just as well the doctors weren't there to hear, and he went on. 'I haven't found out what my father did, but I did pounce on a bit of news, and that's that she wasn't with him the whole day. They came to Charing Cross by the same train, but he wasn't. with her when she go to get that arsenic from chemist's'. 'And God above only knows why they put such bits of fools into a shop to sell sixpenny-worths of death over the counter,' says Harry. Then I put my hand in my pocket and pulled out what I had found in Mrs. Blake's corner cupboard, and John took it in his hand and looked at it, and whistled long and low. 'It was Mrs.Blake,' says I, very short and. John's face was red as fire, like some men's is when they're going in fighting. But as for me, I fell a-crying to think that any woman could be so wicked. Harry, he patted me on the back, and told me to cheer up and not to cry, and to be a good girl. Then John, he said--""We'll bring it home to her yet, Harry, my boy"" ""I was a little girl, and I thought I was going to die,"" said the author.. John knew and did it. He didn't tell any one except his dear old parson who buried the old man. The doctors shall tell us how much of the arsenic that cursed old hag gave him. I'll get an order to have poor old father exhumed, and the doctors shallTell us howMuch of the Arsenic That Cursed Old Hag Gave him. John's wife, Mrs. Jezebel, said, 'You're a pretty puss, aren't you, howking up my poor dear deceased husband's remains before they're hardly cold? Much good you'll do yourself' John said he would be there. He was.. 'You'll end in the workhouse, my fine miss, and I shall come to see you as a lady visitor when you're dying' 'I fetched her a smack on the side of the face with the flat of my hand as hard as I could, and bolted off, her after me, and me being young and she stout she couldn't keep up with me' 'It serves him right, it does, to marry a girl out of the gutter!' 'It was a dreadful thing to see them digging, not to make a grave to be filled. 'Then she's no right to anything?' said Harry. But from what my friend here, the rector of St Mary Woolnoth, tells me, it is quite certain she never married him.' 'But what about the will?' says I. But no one harkened to me. No-one harked to me,' said Harry, 'If she poisoned him she will be off by now' 'But from what I hear, she never even married him,' said John, 'and he never married her'. 'I got to know him well afterwards, and he was the best man that ever trod shoe-leather' 'I asked Mr. Parson, will you come with me to keep my hands from violence, and my tongue from evil-speaking and slandering? for I must go home and see if that woman is there yet' 'And parson said he would; and it ended in us,. The story is based on the life of a clergyman in London in the 19th century. The novel is about a young man who meets the wife of a local clergyman. The story is told through the eyes of the man who first met Mrs Blake. The author describes the moment he realised he had to tell her what had happened to him. He says he was sorry the minute he said. 'And what do you want, young men?' says Mrs. Sigglesfield from Lewes. She had got on her widow's mourning, very smart and complete, with black crape, and her white cap. 'Harry and John was in front, as was right; and in the dusk they could hardly see who was behind' 'And whatDo you want?' she says. 'AndWhat do you Want?' 'I want to know what you want from me,' says Harry. 'I don't want to hear about it,' she says, 'I just want to talk to you'. 'That's the woman that I married on the 7th; and that's the man I married her to!' said he, pointing to Sigglesfield. 'That!' said our parson; 'why, that's Mr. Sigglefield, the solicitor from Lewes.' 'Then the lady opposite is Mrs. Siggsfield, that is all,' said the parson. 'It's plain she wasn't my father's wife,' said Harry. 'I never could see it.' 'That's what I thought,' said Mr. Blake, 'but she looked very handsome'. 'Slowly, old boy!' said John; 'gently does it. How could he have left anything in a will to his wife when he hadn't got any wife? Why, that fellow there---' But here Mrs. Blake got on her feet, and I must say for the woman, if she hadn't had anything else, she had got pluck. 'It was well played, too, though I says it,' she said. 'I don't mind owning up just to please you' 'I'm not going to lie to you,' said the parson. '. 'It's my duty to warn you,' said John, 'that anything you say may be used against you' 'I married Robert Sigglesfield in the name of William Alderton, and he sitting trembling there, like a shrimp half boiled!' said Mrs. Blake. 'And what about that arsenic I found in your corner cupboard?' 'Oh, it was you took it, was it? You little silly, my neck's too handsome for me to do anything to put a rope round it?' Do you suppose I've kept my complexion to my age with nothing but cold water, you little cat?'. 'It's no use bearing malice now all's said and done,' she says. 'We waited like lambs for her to come back, which being a woman with her wits about her, and no fool, she naturally never did' 'And by the time we had woke up to our seven senses, she was far enough away, and we never saw her again' 'Harry and John was that pleased to be together again that they couldn't make up their minds to part' 'So they farm the place together to this day' 'If Harry has prospered, and John too, it's no more than they deserve, and a blessing on brotherly love' '.

He had tried every newspaper office in the city with disheartening results; every office save this one. The words sounded so empty and perfunctory, the World was such a big paper, his own ignorance was so great, and. Tom applied for the job of city editor. He was told by a man who was cutting a newspaper into shreds. Tom thanked the man and went on to the next apartment. The man with the glasses took no notice of his approach.. Tom found his voice and laid the letter on the desk. The editor's forehead was a mass of wrinkles and his eyes glared threateningly from behind his glasses. ""I went to college for a year and a half, sir; I had to leave then."" Tom tried to detect a smile somewhere on the frowning face; there was none. ""So you think you can do newspaper reporting. ""If those things can be done by other fellows, I can do them,"" said Tom. ""But we don't break new men in here on the World,"" said the editor. ""When you prove that you can do as good work as three or four men on our staff you'll hear from us"". Tom's words died away. He had his answer and there could be no benefit gained from prolonging the interview. He turned suddenly and faced the city editor again. There was a lump in his throat and his hand, seeking refuge in his pocket, closed on the half dozen coins. ""I've got a right to better treatment than you have given me,"". ""I'm not offering you a place; I'm not even giving you a fair deal,"" he said. ""But when a fellow shows sense I give him a chance. And I'll give you one."" He took a card from a drawer, scowling more than ever. ""Write your name there and send. Tom Collins had six minutes to catch the 2.20. The last edition goes to press at five o'clock. The whole undertaking was the merest forlorn hope. Not even the fighting chance that the city editor of the World had called it.. The Democratic National Convention to nominate a candidate for the presidency was but a month away. Dissension threatened. The East favored a man of moderate views on the subject of currency reform. The West and the greater portion of the South stood unanimous for a politician whose success in the coming battle would presage the most radical of measures.. Tom Collins was a reporter for the Washington Post. He was sent to investigate the death of Senator August. Collins was unable to find out who August was. He decided to go to the train station to ask a porter. The porter told him it was the train for New York.. The senator looked up and said, ""I'm from the Washington World. I just missed you at the hotel so I took the liberty of following you to the train."" Tom thought that sounded pretty well and paused to see what impression it had created. The result was disappointing.. ""I was assigned to get the result of the conference and I've got to do it--that is, if I can."" ""I have no objection to your traveling on the same train with me, just as long as you don't bother me"" ""I am on. Tom told the senator about his three weeks of dreary search for a position. Senator August was no longer frowning; the boy's tale had interested him. ""I've been a reporter only half an hour. In fact I'm not certain that I am one at all."". ""I don't think it was quite that. And, anyhow, I knew what I was doing, and so it was fair enough, I guess,"" he said.. Tom put his hand into his pocket and brought out all his money; less than two dollars. He held it out to the gaze of the conductor. Tom nodded. ""All right conductor; we'll arrange this; come around again later, will you?"". The train had slowed down and now it paused for an instant beside a little box of a station. Then it started on again and a train man appeared at the far end of the car holding a buff envelope in his hand. ""Senator August in this car?"" he asked. ""You are lucky,"" he said.. The telegram was from Senator Harrison M. August. The message was sent from Chicago to Waverly, Maryland. The telegram warned that if the report was untrue, many votes would be lost. Tom was too astounded to speak.. ""We reach Blankville Junction in eight minutes. Write what I dictate to you as fast as you can. You know shorthand? All the better."" ""Get that off as soon as we reach Baltimore and bring me a receipt for it,"" he told Tom.. Tom's copy was dated with a big black pencil, ran three strokes the length of each sheet, wrote a very long and startling head over it and thrust it into the hands of a waiting boy. ""How'd you do it?"" he asked, frowning tremendously.. ""He'll not get there until 8.30; too late for the evening papers. The biggest beat of the year, by George!"" ""Are you certain he said he'd not give out the statement again until he reached New York?"" ""Quite certain,"" was the reply.. Tom Collins was sent to work for the first time. The city editor told him to arrive at work on time. He was told to be prompt"

Yale had the best team she had had in several years. And our chance of winning from her was about one in one hundred. But we were a daffy lot that fall, and every time fate smote us we grinned harder and hitched up the enthusiasm another peg. On the Thursday before the game we had our fourth mass meeting in the Union. We had a great time, and we were very proud of our team. But Penn rubbed it into us good and hard--which wasn't the way it was written--and about half the college began writing letters to the Crimson. We were very disappointed.. The captain assured us that every man on the team was ready to do his level best and lay down his life for the honor of the Crimson. We applauded wildly. The University Band, eleven strong, got together after a fashion and we pretty near lifted the roof. After that we cheered and sung some more and the enthusiasm kept on bubbling up. We stood loyally behind the team on Saturday the team would do its part and fight to the last breath--or ditch, I forget which. The captain of the Nine got up, brushed the perspiration from his marble brow, and started the singing. We pretty near lifting the roof after that.. The Harvard Crimson was founded in 1858. The Harvard Crimson is a magazine published by Harvard University. The magazine is published by the Harvard University Press.

""What we need,"" said Bud, ""is a band"" ""But we can't get one,"" answered Withey. ""Then let's get part of a band."" ""McTurkle,"" answered Bud, with a grin. ""A-a-aye!"" we yelled. ""Mc Turkle! We want McTurkles!"" ""Ack! Ack! What's going to happen?"" ""We're going to get a band,"" said Withey, ""and we're gonna sing like mad!"". McTurkle was a funny genius. He was forever grinding. When he wasn't grinding he was causing strange, painful sounds to emanate from his room. For a good while we had puzzled over those sounds. Then, one fateful night, we had descended upon Mc Turkle in force and learned the truth. He performed on the French horn. A French horn is an instrument which is wound up in a knot like a morning-glory vine, and the notes have such a hard time getting out that they get all balled up and confused and are never the same afterwards. I'll bet a hat that the man who invented the French Horn was the same chap who invented French verbs.. ""Out there""--Bud waved his hand toward the window--""out there our college--your college--the college we all love awaits you"" ""Tomorrow the pick of our athletic young manhood does battle with the brawny horde of Yale,"" said Bud. ""We are on the eve of a great conflict,"" said McTurkle, ""and we are ready for it"" ""And we will win,"" said the president, ""because we are prepared for it,"" and they did. ""And so will you,"" said MacKenzie. ""Because we are not prepared to lose"". ""Not for a moment do we acknowledge defeat, sir! Not until the pall of evening settles over the trampled field of battle shall we abandon hope. The university stands firm and undismayed behind her loyal warriors!"" From outside came a long, impatient wail from two thousand throats: ""We-want-to-go-to the stadium!"" ""What of that, McTurkle!"" demanded Bud, sternly.. ""But--but--what is it you wish me to do?"" stammered the dazed McTurkle. ""The spirit of Harvard speaks! Her sons demand to be led to the scene of the conflict that with mighty voices they may--er--consecrate the field to victory!"" ""Who? Me? Me--ah--lead?"" cried McTurksle.. ""But--but--I'm afraid I don't know any of the--ah--the college airs."" ""What of that! It is your leadership we want; that and the inspiring strains of your dulcet horn"" ""But-- but--I don't know any of the college airs"" ""And now the knowledge that the whole university demanded his aid, his leadership,. ""I'll go!"" he said, with majestic simplicity. His face glowed; he leaped to his feet; a Greek lexicon crashed to the floor; McTurkle was transformed. ""On to Soldier's Field!"" they cried. ""Fellows!"" he shouted. ""I'm going to the game!"" he cried. He was going to play the game.. ""A-a-aaye!"" they cheered. ""Fellows!"" ""Band!"" ""Where's the band?"" called those further down the line. From far down by Thayer came wild paeans of delight. ""Where'd they get it? ... Where is it?"" they asked.. McTurkle, beaming delightedly through his glasses, his head held back inspiritingly and the folds of his plaid jacket waving in the November wind, placed the French horn to his lips, took a mighty breath and--the procession moved forward to the strains of ""Annie Laurie!"" The French horn has a compass of only four octaves and is principally useful as an orchestral adjunct. Its ability is limited and its use as a solo instrument slight. Four octaves be blowed! Mc Turkle went fourteen, or I'll eat my hat! Why, the way he. ""We had it and to burn. We exuded it at every step. Enthusiasm was a drug on the market,"" says Bob Dylan. ""We had to hold up the cars for ten minutes, and Bud was for circling back and holding them up ten minutes more"" ""The line was so long that the cars were held up for 10 minutes,"" he says. ""And all the while McTurkle, thin, gaunt, but impressive, marched at the head and informed us startlingly and with convincing emphasis that for Bonnie Annie Laurie he'd lay. ""We marched once, the band still clinging to ""Traviata"" and the fellows singing whatever pleased them, generally ""Up the Street"" Then we had a snake dance, a wonder of a snake Dance! The band got lost in the shuffle, but later on we found him standing serene and undismayed under the shadow of the west stand spouting ""Auld Lang Syne"" ""When he called for ""a regular cheer for the band"" the way we hit it up was a cheeky, unashamedly unafraid of the weather. ""We had a great time, and we're still having fun with it.. ""Speech by McTurkle"" was a stirring performance by the late Bob Dylan. The crowd erupted in cheers and applause. Dylan was deeply affected by the experience. ""Who is he? ... It's the band! ... 'Ray for the band!"" he said. ""Spe-e-eech!"" he yelled.. ""Fellows,"" prompted Bud. ""Go on! Say it!"" yelled the audience. ""Fellow"" was McTurkle's answer. ""Don't say it if it hurts you, old man,"" some one advised. ""A-a-A-aye!"" yelled others. ""What's he talking about?"" asked another. ""There is to be, I understand, a game to-morrow, a contest between. ""Football, you blamed fool!"" whispered Bud, hoarsely. ""The mantle of victory will fall upon the shoulders of our--ah--representatives,"" he said. ""Physical exercise is, I am convinced, of great benefit,"" he added.. ""Har-vard! Har-vard!"" he shouted. ""The Turkey! The Turkey! the Turkey!"" He was late for the game. McTurkle's door was ajar. He kicked it open and stuck his head in. ""Do you know what time it is? You'll be late."" ""Yes, for the match,"" he said. ""Yes. For the game."" ""The game"" came. And it came. But there was no climax.. ""No, no, I'm not going to attend the--ah--game."" He waved a hand toward the book-covered table. ""I shall be quite busy this afternoon, quite busy. But you have my--my best wishes."

Jenny and me walked out of a Sunday, as often as not Amelia would come with us, and all went on happy enough for a while. Then I began to notice Jenny didn't seem to care so much about walking out, and one Sunday afternoon she said she had a headache and would rather stay at home by the fire. Amelia and me took a turn by ourselves, and when we got back to Teesdale's farm, there was Jenny, wonderfully brisked up, talking and laughing away with young Wheeler, whose father keeps the post-office. I was not best pleased, I can tell you, but I kept a. Jenny was not in the house, but Amelia was. But at last I said to myself, 'This can't go on; us three that used to be so jolly, we're as flat. Amelia was alone in the house. The old folks had gone to a Magic Lantern in the schoolroom. She went red, and she went white and red again. Then says she, 'Jenny'll never forgive me if I tell you' Then says Amelia, 'I can't abear to tell you, Tom, for I know it will break your 'eart' ''Jenny shan't never know,' says I; and I swore. 'I'll wring her neck for her,' says I. 'But that's just what you've swore not to do,' says she. 'She'll never forgive me if you do, Tom,' says Amelia. 'I swear I won't,' says Tom. But if I tell you where to find them, you swear you won't speak or make a fuss, because she'd know I'd told you?' 'I can't abear to stand by and see you deceived, Tom', says Amelia, 'so I'll tell you. ""I don't think any man need envy me what I felt as I walked about the lanes waiting till it was time to walk up to the church and find out for certain that I'd been made a fool of"" ""I stood for a minute and looked at them, and but for what I'd swore to Amelia I believe I should have taken Wheeler by the throat and shaken the life out of him then and there"" ""If you go by the churchyard an hour from now, you'll see them in the porch; but don't you say a word to them,  and never say I told you"". 'I left everything: my master that I was bound to, and my trade and my father. And I went straight off to London. I should have been a soldier right enough but that I fell in with a fireman, and he persuaded me to go in for that business, which is just as exciting as a soldier's, and a great deal more dangerous, most times. So no more at present from your sincere well-wisher TOM.' 'I'm going for a soldier.' 'P.S. I'm going to London'. ""I never cared to walk out with another girl when I thought of Jenny"" ""I didn't tell my folks where I'd gone, and for years I heard nothing from them"" ""Then I went back and I looked for Wheeler. There he was, lying on the bed, drunk. The devil says to me, 'What call have you to go and find him, the drunken swine?'

'No,' says she, 'I'm only on liking as it were' 'Then leave, for God's sake,' says I, 'if you've got a bit of love for me left' 'It's worth something to be loved as you've loved me, Amelia, and. 'Me marry you, and be happy after all the harm I've done? You run away from your articles and turned fireman, and Jenny married to a drunken brute--no, Tom, no! I don't deserve to be happy; but, if you forgive me, I shan't be as miserable as I was' 'Well,' says I, 'if ever you think better of it let me know' 'Within two years, she did think better'. ""If I'd listened to Satan and hadn't pulled Wheeler out, I shouldn't have got burned, and I wouldn't have found Amelia again,"" he says. ""No such harm done then after all.' So she married me. And now, we're farming the same bit of land that my father farmed before us"" ""Eight years of unhappiness is enough punishment for most of the wrong things a man can do, or a woman either for that matter,"" he adds.

0.43,0.53,33.30564784053156,"Patsy was a diminutive wisp of humanity, a starved, slender elf with a freckled face, wizened and peaked, which at times looked a thousand years old. After each put he ambled forth, lifted the metal ball from the ground with two dirty little hands, snuggled it against the front of his dirty little shirt, and labored back with it. Patsy's gray Irish eye could sparkle merrily and his thin little Irish mouth usually wore a. Patsy was attentive to all of us, but his heart was Fosgill's. He used to wait outside the Locker Building until we came out after dressing and then walk beside Fos gill until he reached the Square. He speedily began calling FosGill ""Bull,"" but I don't think he meant the slightest disrespect.. Patsy was the son of a teamster and his brother, Brian. Patsy had vivid recollections of the night they broke down the door and put the handcuffs on his father. He had an idea it was something regarding the disappearance of numerous suits of clothes from a tailor's shop. He was going into business himself just as soon as they let him stop school; he was going to sell papers.. Patsy appeared with the first warm day, looking thinner and littler and older than ever. He had tried several times to wean himself from education, but each time they haled him back to the schoolhouse. Patsy thought the thing was terribly wrong. He thought he was going to die. He died in a car crash in the middle of the night. He was found dead in his car, with a gunshot wound.. Patsy Fosgill was a star baseball player in the early '50s. He decided not to go into business and went to college. He was a shot putter, and his family was proud of him. He died in a car accident in 2009. He is survived by his wife, two children and a brother.. Patsy's countenance took on its expression of lofty contempt. ""What college you going to?"" he asked Billy. ""Yep, I know. It's tough, but I guess I can do it. Was--was it hard for you?"" ""An' you ain't much of a shot putter, either,"" said Patsy.. ""He's an all-right kid, is Patsy, and he deserves something better than spending his life on the streets. We'll adopt him."" ""Sure thing,"" said Allen. ""But we'll have our hands full. And what's to happen when we leave college?"" ""We'll get some one to look after him,"" said Bull. ""Imagine Patsy putting the shot!"". The team was certain of first and third places in the Dual Meet. The outcome of the shot put depended on the outcome of that event. Bull Fosgill beat Tanner with the shot we were it, the team thought. But things don't happen just as expected; they seldom do in athletics. And it happened like this: The team won the dual meet, but not in the way they had expected. The team was not the team it had thought it was.. Fosgill was ahead with forty-one, ten and a half, Tanner had done three inches under that, and Burt and I were fighting along for third place, doing around thirty-eight, six. We had finished one round when the accident occurred. Tanner hopped across the circle, overstepped--fouling the put--and sent the shot away at a tangent. Patsy had a good deal of the primeval left in him.. Patsy threw himself like a little catapult at Fosgill and sent him staggering across the turf. Then Patsy and the shot went down together. The shot had struck him on the breast and Patsy's weak little bones had just crushed in. He was still breathing, but the doctor said he never knew anything after the shot struck him--not until evening. Well, we were all frightfully cut up, and Tanner sat down on the ground and nearly fainted.. Patsy was taken off the operating table and put to bed. The doctor told us that there was nothing to be done. We went back to training table, but we were a low-spirited lot. I did thirty-six and thirty-seven, eleven, and won third place at that. Neither Fosgill nor Tanner equaled his first records. We got the meet by four and a half points.. Fosgill sat down at the head of the cot and leaned over, his mouth all atremble. Patsy was a pathetic-looking little wisp as he lay there with the bedclothes lifted away from. Patsy looked at me with a new respect. ""You can't--fool me, Bull. I'm--a goner,"" he whispered. Fosgill muttered something and Patsy's eyes brightened.. ""Huh! I'm glad--Bull. I'd--'a' done most anything--for you, Bull. You've been good--to me; so's the--others."" He closed his eyes wearily for a moment. ""Do you think,"" he asked slowly, ""I. ""Good-by--Bull,"" he said very softly. His eyes half closed."
0.88,0.98,73.42281879194631,"Pemberton: Yale and Princeton had been battling on the gridiron for an hour and a half. He found the contest exciting, breathlessly so at moments, but disappointing. Pemberton says he found the game exciting at times but disappointing at others. He says he was disappointed that the game ended with the score still at 0-0. He calls the game a ""disappointing"" and ""boring"" game. The game was held at Yale Field, in front of 25,000 people. Pembroke: The game had been exciting at moments and disappointing at other times.. Pemberton was a freshman at Exeter. He was a bundle of nerves, endowed with a kind of brilliant, dashing recklessness that often wins where larger courage fails. Pemberton had put his whole mind into football with the result that he had made the team in time to play for five short, mad minutes against Andover. He is a great man, and a great player. He will be remembered for his bravery and determination. He has been a great loss to Exeter and to the sport of football in general, but he will always be remembered as one of the best players in the history of the university. He had a great heart and a big heart. He would have been a wonderful player if he had been a full-time player.. Pemberton was a freshman at Yale. He was a left half back. He played in the game against Princeton. He had a good chance of playing. He didn't like to sit. He liked to do things. He wanted to be useful. He wasn't a player who sat on the bench and waited for the game to end. He preferred to be active. He loved to play. He enjoyed the game. He felt it was his duty to play for the team. He did not like to be left out. He would often play in the midfield. He also played in defense. He always played with his left foot. He could not sit on his right. He often played in midfield. His right foot was always on the ground. His left foot was on the floor. He never sat on his left.. Thousands of eyes fixed themselves expectantly on Princeton's left half back, dreading or hoping to see him fall back for a kick. On the thirty yards Yale's line braced and held. Princeton tried a run outside of left tackle and got a yard. The ball was directly in front of goal. The Princeton cheers rang out redoubled in intensity, sharp, entreating, only to be met with the defiant slogan of Yale. ""Yale is the team to beat!"" Yale's slogan was met with a resolute ""No"" Princeton won the game 24-17. The game was played in New Haven, Connecticut, on November 14, 1913. The final score was 24-16. The match was played at Yale's Yale University.. Pemberton shuffled his scarred brown leather shoes uneasily and gnawed harder at his knuckles. Princeton was playing desperately, fighting for the twenty-yard line. A play that looked like a tandem at right guard resolved itself into a plunge at left tackle and gave them their distance. The Yale stands held staring, troubled faces. The Princeton stands were on their feet, shouting, waving, swaying excitedly; score cards were sailing and fluttering through the air. Pemberton scowled fiercely across. His left-hand neighbor whistled a tune softly. Princeton piled her backs through again for a yard. A last desperate plunge carried the little army of the Orange and Black over the coveted mark. The cheering died away.. The ball was caught in the middle of the field by a defender. It was the first goal of the match. The crowd was in raptures. The match was over in less than two minutes. The game was over. The players were elated. The fans were disappointed. The field was full of flags. The stadium was full. It had been a great day. The goal was a great moment. But it was not the first time this had happened. The first time it had happened in a match, it had been the second time. The second time, it was the third. The third time, the fourth. The fourth time, and the fifth. The sixth time, they had already scored. The fifth time, in the sixth minute, the goal was scored.. Princeton ran Yale's kick-off back to her forty yards. The Blue's right guard was taken out, white and wretched, after the first scrimmage. Princeton started at her battering again, content now to make only sufficient gains to keep the ball. But with a yard to gain on the third down a canvas clad streak broke through and nailed her tackle behind the line. Pemberton, shouting ecstatically, saw that the streak was his erstwhile neighbor, and was proud of the acquaintance. ""We've got time to score, but will we?"" asked the head coach alertly. ""I guess here's where your Uncle Tom gets a whack at Old Nassau--maybe."" He sat up and watched the head Coach alertly, peeling off his sweater for him. The next moment Pemberon was pe. Pemberton watched, with his heart fluttering up into his throat. The head coach's gaze fixed itself upon him, passed on up the line, came back to him and stayed. Pemberton dropped his eyes. It isn't good form to stare Fate in the face. Was it a second later or an age that his name was called? Pemberon's name was. The Yale supporters, however, found cause for rejoicing, and cheered gloriously until there was a fumble and the Blue lost four yards on the recovery. But, all said, it was slow work and unpromising with the score board announcing five minutes to play. ""Here's a pretty good chance to show what you can do,"" the coach said. ""Go in at left half; tell Haker to come out. And--er--Pemberon, here's apretty good chance of showing what he can. Pemberton ran a mile in 4:34 1-5. It was second down now, with nine yards to gain. Haker shoved him aside, mumbling impatient words through swollen lips. Pemberton ranged himself behind the big tackle disapprovingly. Where was the use, he asked himself, of wasting a down by plunging at the line? What had they put him in there for if not to take the ball? Then the signal came and the next moment he was in the maelstrom. He had run a mile. He'd run a miles in 4-5-1. He was running a mile, and he'd run it in four minutes and forty-two seconds. He would show Haker and everyone else whether he was a kid! He'd show them whether he'd ever been a kid.. Yale placed a tackle, full back and left half behind her tackle guard hole on the left. Her right half fell back about six yards to a position behind quarter. When the dust of battle lifted, the ball was just one yard nearer the Princeton goal. The only play from just this formation that he was acquainted with was one in which he merely performed the inglorious part of interference. However, maybe the quarter knew his business, though deep down in his soul he doubted it. It might mean a kick or a tandem, or a run around left end; Princeton's right half hesitated and edged back toward his line. Of course the ball is his, but why was he placed so far away from it? The only time he had been in this formation was in a game in which the Yale quarter back had interfered with him.. The Yale quarter had reckoned without Pemberton. The play started beautifully. But the Yale quarter hadn't reckoned with the fact that Pemberon was out. The Yale quarter were out of the game. And the Yale team had reckoned with that. The game had been won by the Yale side. And they had won the game in the final minute. But they had also taken a risk on the play. And it was a risk they didn't want to take. It was a play that was aimed at the left center of Yale's line, but in reality going through at the right end. And that was the risk they were taking. It wasn't the play they wanted to take, but the risk was worth it.. Pemberton's excited brain had confused the 'varsity with the freshman signals. The fact that he was to be practically unprovided with interference did not bother him. What was wanted was a touchdown, or, failing that, a good long gain. The ball disappeared from sight; and so, in a measure, did Pemberton. He had thought he was going to receive the ball, but it was actually the other way around. He was on his toes, waiting to dash across to where the hole was being torn open for him. And then something went wrong! A figure sped across toward the right end of the line between quarter and right half just as the ball left the former's hands. It was the quarterback, who had been on the receiving end of a pass from the right half. The play had been called off, and the quarter had been handed the ball back.. Yale's backs were messing around in a peculiarly aimless manner which, to the Princeton players, suggested a delayed pass or some equally heinous piece of underhand work. So Princeton piled through Yale's line to solve the difficulty, thinking little of the absurd youth who had shot around her left end without interference. From Princeton's center to her right end everything was confusion. It was a glorious struggle, but futile. For the ball was snuggled in Pemberton's right elbow, and he was down near the thirty yards sprinting for goal. In front of him was the Princeton quarter back; behind him, racing madly, came a Princeton half half. The ball was in the right elbow of Pemberon's right arm. He was glad the quarter tossed the ball so exactly; otherwise he would have had to slow down. As it was he was going like an express train by the time he swept around the Princeton line.. Pemberton saw the waving flags from the corner of his eyes. He feinted to the left, dug his shoes sharply in the turf and went by to the right. The Princeton quarter was in his path, white and determined, with fingers curved like talons in anticipation of his prey. Pemberton increased his speed by just that little that is always possible. The quarter dug his face in the ground, scrambled somehow to his feet, and took up the chase. The whole field was racing after him--was still a good ten yards behind. He escaped the quarter's diving tackle by the length of a finger. He was relieved. The twenty-yard line, dim and scattered, passed under his feet. He heard the cheers and shouts drowned the thumping of his heart and the pat, pat of his feet on the trampled turf. He saw the cheering flags and heard the shouts of the crowd.. Pemberton was running straight at top speed for the center of the goal line. The pursuing half back found his advantage, for he held a course nearer the center. At the ten-yard line the flying Yale man was a yard to the good; at the five-year line the Princeton player had him by the thighs and was dragging like a ton of lead. Pemberton's fighting spirit came to his rescue, however, and he won the match. The match was played at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, on November 14, 1881. The game was won by Yale, 2-1, and the game was played in front of a crowd of 2,000.. Pemberton fought on until the ball was three yards away. He crashed over on his face, midway between the goal posts. He locked his joints and strained forward until somewhere behind him a whistle shrilled. Then he rolled over on the back, closed his eyes and fought for breath. Few could have missed that goal; certainly not Yale's quarter back. Once more the ball went over the exact center of the goal line, but this time above the cross bar. There was rejoicing loud and continued until the final whistle was blown. It was the first time Yale had won a match in the US since the turn of the 20th century. The match was played at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, on September 26, 1881. The game was won by Yale's John Lydon, who scored a goal in the second half. The final score was 1-0. It is the only match in which Yale has won at least one game in the USA.. Yale beats Princeton 6-5. Pemberton: ""I ought not to have allowed that Princeton chap to get near me"" Yale's win over Princeton was the school's first in the Ivy League. Yale's first win over a major college team was in 1903. Yale won its first Ivy League title in 1903, beating Harvard. Yale had never beaten Harvard in the regular season before that year. The school's last victory over Harvard was in 1906, when the team won its"
0.67,0.77,52.629745733194014,"Lady Breynton had been dead this many a year. She hadn't come to her husband with her hands empty. They say that Sir Jasper had been very wild in his youth. But he took to her baby wonderful. I was nurse to that baby from the first, and a fine handsome little chap he was. When my Lady died he was wholly given over to my care. I believe any of us would have cut our hand off at the wrist if he had told us to. He had that kind of way with him, masterful and gentle at the same time, like as if he was kind to you for his own pleasure, and ordering you about for your own good. She worshipped the ground Sir Jasper walked on.. Jasper was as wild as his father had been before him. He made young men enemies, not friends. I loved him because I had brought him up, and I never had a child of my own. I never wished to be married, but I used to wish that little Jasper had been my own child. I should have loved him to the end but for one thing, and that comes in its own place in my story. But even those who loved young Jasper best couldn't help seeing he hadn't his father's winning ways.. There were many tales about Sir Jasper, but I didn't think it was my place to listen to them. Young Robert was a steady chap, and used to read and write of an evening instead of spending a jolly hour or two at the Dove and Branch. And Sir Jasper gave him books without end and good advice, and would have him so often about him he set everybody's tongue wagging to a tune more merry than wise. I could have had an authority over him then that I hadn't as his nurse, and perhaps it might have all turned out differently. I couldn't help seeing how like young Robert, the under-gamekeeper, was to the Family. He had their black, curly hair, and merry Irish eyes, and he. ""I always take a pleasure in remembering that I was with him to the last, and did everything that could be done for him with my own hands,"" says Nelly. ""It brings tears into my eyes when I think of it. 'Nelly,' he says, 'I know I can trust you.' And so he could, whatever it might have been,"" she says. ""And so he was with me to the end, and I said, 'Yes, sir.' And I said 'Yes' and so he can, whatever the case may have been."" ""And young Robert loved the master, of course. Who didn't?"" asks Nelly. 'Then go,' he said, 'to my old secretaire and open it' There was rows of pigeon-holes inside, and little drawers with brass knobs. 'You take hold of the third knob from the right, Nelly,' said he. 'Don't pull it; give it a twist round' I did, and lo and behold! a little drawer jumped out at me from another part of the secretaire.. 'The end has come very suddenly,' says he; 'but it is best this way' 'I think I shall sleep if you lay that beside me, for I am very tired, Nelly,' he said, 'very tired' 'Hand me out, my girl, hand me out,' he says. 'I know well enough you'll do it after' 'And when he said that, I was glad I had never kissed another man' 'You needn't wake the doctors. It's very dark outside. Hand me out'. 'I was putting something in the master's coffin he told me to put there' 'It's in a case. It may be some old letter or a lock of hair as belonged to your mother.' 'It may be an old letter,' says I, 'or some old lock of your mother's hair' 'I don't know what it is,' says the young man, 'but it's in the case.' 'What was it?' says I. 'An old letter, or a locks of hair.' 'I'm sorry,' he says, 'I didn't mean to upset you.' 'Yes, I know,' I say. 'It was. 'Good Lord, bless your soul, sir, no,' I said. 'That was no will or lawyer's letters, it was but some little token of remembrance he set store by.' 'Thanks, Nelly, that was all I wanted to know,' he replied. 'It seemed to me, if it was so, my master was right to make a proper provision for Robert as well as for Jasper' 'I'm going to trust you,' he said, 'and I'll tell you all about it' 'Yes,' I replied, 'I will.'. The doctor was staying in the house, and master's younger brother, besides the lawyer and young Master Jasper. I couldn't help thinking of my master as I had known him all these years. And then my poor Jasper--I say 'poor,' but I never loved and pitied him less than I did that night. He had lost such a father, and he could go troubling about whether he had got the whole estate or not. So I lay awake, and I thought of the coffin lying between its burning tapers in the great bedroom. And I wished they had not screwed him down, for then I could have gone, late as it was, and had another look at my master's face. And as I lay it seemed to me that I heard a door opened, and then a step, and a. Jasper's door was open and he could see the screws in the coffin. He took them out and set them on the table. He then went back to his room and opened the door. He said: 'I could not have moved, not for the crown, not if I had been able to' He said he had been trying not to think about what he had done. 'I was trying to keep from thinking about what I had done to my father' He added: 'He was a good man, and I was proud of him. He was not a bad man' He then left the room and returned to his bed.. Jasper went to his father's coffin and began to search for what I had put in beside him. He had not a thought for his father; all his thoughts was to find out what his father hadn't wished him to know. I cared no more for what he thought or what he felt than I should have done if he had been a common thief as, God forgive me, he was in my eyes at that hour. I may be a heartless woman, and I suppose I am, or how account for it? But when I saw my young master go to his dad's coffin like that, and begin to serve his own interest and his own curiosity, every spark of love I had ever had for the boy died out.. Young Sir Jasper and I both turned sharp. His ears were as quick as mine, and he had heard the key too, I suppose. So I crept behind him softly, softly, an inch at a time, till I got to where I could see the coffin. I kept looking at that dead face till I nigh forgot what I was there for. And while I was standing mazed like and stupid, young Master Jasper had got out the green case, and was turning over what was in it in his hands. Almost at the same time my heart came leaping into my mouth, and if ever a woman nearly died of fright, I was that woman. But then some one behind me put a hand on my shoulder and said, 'What's all this?'. 'Do I get nothing, then?' shrieked young Sir Jasper, trembling like a woman, and with the devil looking out of his eyes. 'Your father intended you to have the entailed estates, right or wrong; that was his choice' 'You, Jasper, are but the son by a second marriage; and Sir Robert, I congratulate you, for you are come. Jasper's father had left the estate to his son. The will was signed by Jasper's brother, Sir Robert. Jasper was furious with his father. He threw the doctor out of the house and never saw him again. Sir Robert was never heard from again. He died in his sleep in his room.. The author's master left her no money, but he bade his heir keep her on in his old place. She still lives on as a housekeeper at the Hall. The great picture of himself that hung in the Hall hangs in my room now, and looks down on me as I write, she writes. But to no purpose. He is all that I used to wish the boy Jasper might be, and he has a reason for loving me which Jasper never had. He has a great love for me, and I am glad to think that he did not choose to leave me money. But instead the great picture hangs in his room now."
0.86,0.96,68.41142857142857,"Bayard Newlyn was a guard at Yale. He was 6 feet and one inch tall and weighed one hundred and ninety-four pounds. He joined a poor frat and was queered right away. He wrote a book about his experiences at Yale called ""Bi"" Briggs. The book is published by Simon & Schuster, Inc., at $25.99.

Bi was taking about every course any of us had ever heard of--and several we hadn't--and had no time for football. We got licked for keeps that fall, and after the Crimson and the Bulletin and the Graduates' Magazine and the newspapers had shown us just what ailed our system of coaching, we started to reorganize things. We hadn't reorganized for two years, and it was about time. The new coach was a chap who hadn't made the Varsity when he was in college, but who was supposed to have football down to a fine point. Well, he started in by kidnaping every man in college who weighed over a hundred and sixty-five. Bi didn't escape. Bi had played one year in the freshwater college at left tackle and knew a touchdown from a nose-guard, and that was about all. Bi was for refusing to have anything to do with football at first;. Bayard Briggs was a good-looker, with sort of curly brown hair, nice eyes, a romantic nose, and cheeks like a pair of twenty-four-dollar American Beauties. When they took Bi from the second and put him in at right guard on the Varsity we all approved. But there was trouble right away. Bi didn't seem to fit. They swapped him over to left guard, then they tried him at right tackle, then at rightguard again. Then they placed him gently but firmly back on the second. And Bi was quite happy and contented and disinterested during it all. He was terribly good-natured. That was the main trouble with him. The fellows who did football for the papers fell in love with him on the spot. And they weren't far wrong. The coaches did expect great things from Bi.. ""I think the trouble was that Bi never got it fully into his head that it wasn't just fun--like p-in-the-corner or blind-man's-buff. He didn't mind when six coaches gathered about him and demanded to know what was the matter with him. He just assured them good-naturedly that he didn't know. When he came back to the second he seemed rather glad; I think he felt as though he had got back after a hard trip. He stayed right with us all the rest of the season. I wished afterwards that I hadn't had time myself. I fancy Bi's father had told him that he was coming to college to study, and Bi believed him.. Hecker was a successful lawyer in Tonawanda, New York. He didn't show up for spring practice; couldn't leave his work. At the end of the year he graduated summa cum laude, and the Crimson said he was coming back to the Law School and would be eligible for the team. Just as though it mattered. We showed up a week before college began and had practice twice a day. Yale trimmed us 23 to 6. The Crimson had to look up its old files to find out who Hecker was. Hecker had played right half two years, it seemed, but hadn't made any special hit, and Yale had won each year. The Herald said he had played for the Crimson. He was a good player, but he didn't come out either. The Harvard Crimson had a good team, but it was short-handed.. Hecker was about thirty-six, kind of thin, wore glasses, and was a terror for work. He'd always say ""please,"" and if you didn't please mighty quick you'd be sitting on the bench all nicely snuggled up in a blanket before you knew what had struck you. That's the sort of Indian Hecker was, and we loved him. If Hecker heard of a likely chap and thought well of his looks, it was all up with Mr. Chap. He was out on the gridiron biting holes in the sod before he knew it. that's what happened to Bi. Hecker's a little bit of all right, was Hecker. He's one of the quiet kind. He'll always say 'please' and 'please, please, please'. ""Slugger"" Bannen was a gentle, harmless chap, and one of the Earnest Workers in the Christian Association. He could stick his fist through an oak panel same as you or I would put our fingers through a sheet of paper. ""Slugster"" could have walked all over ""Bi"" if he'd really tried to, says the former guard. ""I had to fight hard, though, for I was up against Murray, last year's first sub,"" he says. ""We were shy on plunging halfs that fall and so I got my chance at last,"" he adds. ""It was a great experience for me, and I'll never forget it."" ""SlUGger"" was called ""Slagger"" because he looked like a prizefighter, but he was agentle, harmless man.. We disposed of the usual ruck of small teams, and by the first of November it was mighty plain that we had the best Eleven in years. A week before we went to Philadelphia I had a streak of good luck and squeezed Murray out for keeps. Penn had a dandy team that year and we had to work like anything to bring the ball home. It was nip and tuck to the end of the first half, neither side scoring. Then we took our tackles back and hammered out the only score. But that didn't send our stock up much, because folks didn't know how good Penn was. But the Eli's coaches who saw the game weren't fooled a little bit; only, as we hadn't played anything but the common or garden variety of football, they didn't get much to help them. But we didn't talk that way, and the general impression was that we were another one of the Beaten But Not Humiliated sort.. Bi played hard, but--oh, I don't know. Some fellow wrote once that unless you had football instinct you'd never make a real top-notcher. Maybe Bi didn't have football instinct. Though I'll bet if some one had hammered it into his head that it was business and not a parlor entertainment, he'd have buckled down and done something. It wasn't that he was afraid of punishment; he'd take any amount and come back smiling. Hecker and Cooper were just ahead of me. ""What's the matter with this man""--Hecker glanced at his notebook--""this man Briggs?"" he asked. ""He's a dub; that's all--just a dub,"" answered Cooper. ""That described him pretty well, I thought,"" he said.. The Dartmouth-Yale football game was played in the fall of 1961. The game was won by Dartmouth, but the game was marred by controversy. Dartmouth coach Hecker turned out his right guard after he was protested by Yale. Hecker replaced the guard with Blake, the first sub in the game. The match was played at Dartmouth's Alumni Stadium in Hanover, New Hampshire, on November 14. The Dartmouth-Dartmouth game was the first in the Ivy League series since the first game in 1881. The score was 1-0. The next day, Dartmouth won the game, 3-1, at home. The team went on to win the national championship. The season ended with a victory over the University of Pennsylvania. The final game of the season was at Yale, and Dartmouth won that game, 2-1.. Hecker tried shifting ""Slugger"" Bannen over to right and putting the full back at left. Jordan, the Yale left guard, was the best in the world, and we needed a man that could stand up against him. But ""Sluggger"" was simply at sea on the right side of center and so had to be put back again. After that the only thing in sight that looked the least bit like a right guard was Bayard Newlyn Briggs. They took Bi and put him on the Varsity, and forty-'leven coaches stood over his defenseless form and hammered football into him for eight solid hours on Wednesday and Thursday. And Bi took it all like a little woolly lamb, without a bleat. But it just made you sick to think what was going to happen to Bi when Jordan got to work on him!. ""We are going to give her a drubbing that she will look back upon for several years with painful emotion,"" said Hecker. ""It isn't often that we have an opportunity to beat Yale, and I propose to make the best of this one"" ""So kindly disabuse your mind of the idea that we are merely going out to play a nice, exhilarating game of football,"" he said. ""Incidentally; yes. But we are going more than play her; we aregoing to beat her to a standstill"" ""We're going to play Yale, sir?"" asked Briggs. ""Yes,"" replied Hecker, ""and we're not going to be able to stop her."" ""Then we'll play Yale,"" said Briggs, ""but we'll be in a much better position than before"". ""I suppose you know that your presence on the team is a sheer accident?"" asked the coach dryly. ""Er--certainly,"" answered Bi, getting a bit uneasy. ""What are you going to do about it?"" ""Do? Why, I shall do the best I can, Mr. Hecker"" ""We are going to simply wipe up the earth with Yale!"" said the coach. ""We would never have called on you if there had been anyone else in the college to put in Corson's place"" ""Indeed?"" murmured Bi politely. ""Indeed."" ""And you're going to play opposite him?"" ""Er --certainly"". ""I don't suppose I am any match for Jordan, but I shall try----"" said Bi. ""Don't you dare talk to me of doing the best you can!"" said the coach. ""You've got to make Jordan look like a base imitation before the first half is over!"" ""But it isn't fair!"" protested Bi, ""You know yourself that Jordan can outplay me, sir!"" ""I know nothing of the sort,"" said the Coach. ""I'm sure you know it!"" said Bi, with a smile. ""But I know it! I know nothing! I'm sure I know everything! I'll try my best!"" ""You'll try your best!"" replied the coach, ""and if you don't, we. ""Shall I tell you why we wouldn't have chosen you if there had been anyone else? Because you're a coward--a rank, measly coward, sir!"" ""That will do, sir,"" he said softly, like a tiger-puss purring. ""You've done what no one else has ever done, Mr. Hecker. You've called me a coward. You're in authority and I have no redress--now. But after to-day--"" He stopped and laughed unpleasantly. ""After to- day, sir, it's all over. Now, I'm going to go home and get some sleep."" ""I'm not going to get any sleep,"" he replied. ""I've got a lot of. ""Heroics!"" sneered the coach. ""They don't impress me, sir. I've said you're a coward, and I stand by it. I repeat it. You are a coward"" ""I'd kill you!"" blazed Bi. ""And I'll do it yet, you--you----"" ""Tut, tut! That's enough, Briggs. You can't impose on me that way. I haven't watched you play football all the fall to be taken in now by your melodrama"" ""After to-day you will find me quite at your service, Mr.--Coward. And meanwhile we'll call this interview off,. Bi seized his hat from the table and faced Hecker. He was smiling now, smiling with a white, set, ugly face. ""Perhaps I am wrong,"" he said softly with a little laugh. ""I think I am. Either that or you are lying. For if you are really willing to meet me after to-day's game you are no coward, sir.""Then he went out. Hecker: ""I didn't mind the crowd, but that band got me worried so, that I couldn't do a thing the first ten minutes. It's funny how a little thing like that will queer your game"" Hecker's team won the game, 24-21, and Hecker was named captain. He said: ""We had the ball and began hammering at the Yale line and kept it up until we had reached her fifteen yards. ""It was hammer and tongs from first to last--man's work and lots of it"" ""We didn't rely on tricks, but went at her center and guards and just wore them down"" ""When that first half was over--11-0 was the score--the glory of one Jordan was as a last season's straw hat"" ""It wasn't exciting football to watch, maybe, but it was the real thing with us. We had to work --Lord, how we had to working"" ""I'd never heard any noise!"" ""Maybe the crowd didn't shout! Talk about noise! I'd never hear any before!"" ""It was one-sided, if you like, butIt was no picnic"" ""The game was a great test for us. It was a test for the country."" ""The world was watching us"". Bi Briggs was a cyclone. To see him charge into Jordan--and get the jump on him every time--was alone worth the price of admission. And as for blocking, he was a stone wall, and that's all there is to it. Never once did the Elis get through him. He held the line on his side as stiff as a poker until quarter had got the ball away. And you could almost see the fur fly! Play? O my! He was simply great! And the rest of us, watching when we had a chance, just felt our eyes popping out. He was a new star blazed in the football firmament; and it was in the constellation of Harvard and its name was Bi Briggs.. Yale had us on the run and plugged away until we were digging our toes into our twelve-yard line. Then we held her. After that, although she still played the game as though she didn't know she was beaten, she was never dangerous. We scored twice more in that half in that game. And all the time he smiled; smiled when he went charging through the blue line. He smiled when we pulled him out of a pile-up looking like a badly butchered beef. But that smile wasn't pretty. I guess he was thinking most of the time of Hecker; and maybe sometimes he got Hecker and Jordan mixed up. We knew that Yale would forget that she was bruised and battered and tired and would play harder than ever. And she did. And for just about ten minutes I wouldn't have bet a copper on the game.. Bi was one of the last players to come in after the match. He had a bloody lip and an eye that was out of commission. He smiled as he strode across to where his opponent was standing. The match was over after just ten minutes of play. The score board said: ""Harvard, 22; Opponents, 0"" for the day. The game was a success for both teams. The final match was held at Wembley Stadium on November 17. The result was a 2-1 victory for the Red Devils. The tournament was the first to be won by a British team in the history of the game. It was also the first time the team had won back-to-back matches. The first time this had happened in the competition since the 1930s.. Bi stopped in front of the coach, that same sort of ugly smile on his face. The coach never raised a hand and never changed his expression. ""Gentlemen,"" he said, ""Mr. Briggs was quite within his rights. Please do not interfere with him."" The coach held up his hand and we quieted down. ""The incident demands explanation,"" continued the coach. ""As you all know, we were left in a hole by the loss of Corson and Blake, and the only man who seemed at all possible was Mr. Briggs"" The coach continued, ""As he had been playing all year, would have been no match for Jordan of Yale. But Mr.. Briggs, playing as he has been playing, would be no match at all for Jordan."". ""I told Mr. Briggs that he was a coward, something I knew to be false,"" says Jordan. ""I insulted him over and again until only my authority as head coach kept him from trying to kill me"" ""What I did is, I am well aware, open to criticism. But our necessity was great and I stand ready to accept any consequences,"" Jordan says. ""At least the result of today's contest in a measure vindicates my method"" ""You who saw Mr.. Briggs play will, I'm sure, find excuses for me,"" Jordan adds. ""But our necessity is great and we must win"" ""We must win,"" Jordan insists. ""We have to win."" ""We can't lose,"" says the coach. ""It's the only way we can win."" 'We can win,' says Jordan, ""but we have to first win'. Bi was hailed as the greatest guard of the year, and they put him on the All-American team, but I don't think Bi cared a button. Anyhow, when they tried to get him to come out for the eleven the next fall he absolutely refused, and nothing anyone could say would budge him. He said he was too busy. As for the gentleman himself, it remains with him to say whether he will accept my apology for what passed this morning, taking into consideration the strait in which we were placed and the results as shown, or whether he'll demand other satisfaction."" Hecker: ""For about ten seconds the room was as still as a graveyard. Then Bi stepped up with outstretched hand like a"
0.36,0.45999999999999996,30.381788851048576,"Hilltop School closed its fall term with just ninety-five students; it opened again two weeks later, on the third of January, with ninety-six. Kenneth Garwood had been booked for Hilltop in the autumn, but circumstances had interfered with the family's plans.. Kenneth reached the school before it was dark, and at a quarter of five was in undisputed possession, for the time being, of Number 12, Lower House. When Hilltop returns to school it takes the mid-afternoon express which reaches Moritzville just in time for dinner. Kenneth reached the firm conclusion that there were two persons at Hilltop whom he was going to dislike cordially.. The two men entered Lower House, a dormitory a hundred yards higher on the hill. The instructor was young, scarcely more than twenty-three, tall, sallow, near-sighted and taciturn. Mr. Whipple paused and searched unsuccessfully for a match. ""Just a moment, please, Garwood, and I will--"". Kenneth took up his suit case again. Mr. Whipple blinked behind his glasses. ""I trust that the possession of matches, my boy, does not indicate a taste for tobacco on your part?"" he continued, smiling deprecatingly.. Kenneth sat down in an easy-chair and indulged in regrets. ""I wish I hadn't been so fresh,"" he muttered ruefully. ""It doesn't do a fellow any good to get the teachers down on him"" Number 12 consisted of a small study and a good-sized sleeping room opening off.. The study was well furnished, even if the carpet was worn bare in spots and the green-topped table was a mass of ink blots. There were two comfortable armchairs and two straight-backed chairs, the aforementioned table, two bookcases, one on each side of the window, a wicker wastebasket and two or three pictures. On the whole, Kenneth decided, the study, seen in. Kenneth had traveled a good deal and had seen more of the world than has the average boy of his age. He looked at once self-reliant and reserved. At first glance one might have thought him conceited, in which case one would have done him an injustice. He was fourteen years of age, but he looked older. Not that he was large for his age; it was rather the expression of his face that added that mythical. Kenneth was good-looking, with nice, quiet gray eyes, an aquiline nose and a fairly broad mouth. His hair was brown and quite guiltless of curl. His body was well set up and he carried himself with a little backward thrust of the head and shoulders which might have seemed arrogant, but wasn't, any more than was his steady, level manner of looking at one.. Kenneth felt his prejudices melting away. Surely one couldn't dislike for very long such a jolly, mischievous-looking youth as this! Of Kenneth's own age was the newcomer, a little heavier, yellow-haired and blue-eyed. Merriment gave place to surprise, surprise to resentment on the boy's countenance. Kenneth merely looked respectfully interested. Joe Brewster slid out of his ulster, frowning angrily. ""You're a new boy, aren't you!"" he demanded. ""About an hour and a half old,"" said Kenneth. ""Well, you can't stay here,"" was the inhospitable response.. Joe gave a roar and a rush. Over went the armchair, over went Kenneth. The other boy growled assent. ""The fact is, Brewster, they put me in here with you because you are such a fine character. Dr. Whatshisname said you were the pride of the school, or something like that"" ""I guess they thought association with you would benefit me."". Kenneth was going to like Joe Brewster. He was quite sure he was; providing, of course, that said roommate left enough of him! And then, seeing, or rather feeling his chance, he toppled Joe over his shoulder and in a trice the tables were turned. Now it was Kenneth who was on top, and it took him but a moment to seize Joe. Kenneth was about to get up when a knock came at the door. Joe Brewster, a young boy of fifteen, answered. He was surprised to see Kenneth and Dr. Randall. He asked, ""What's up?"" and Kenneth replied, ""Behave?"". ""I was showing him a new tackle,"" explained Kenneth easily. Joe, somewhat red of face, shot him a look of gratitude. ""Oh,"" said the new arrival, ""and who the dick. Grafton Hyde sat down and viewed Kenneth with frank curiosity. ""Where are you from?"" he demanded. ""Cleveland, Ohio."" ""Any relation to John Garwood, the railroad man?"" ""Ye-es, some. ""It was all newspaper lies,"" said Grafton sententiously. ""Newspapers don't lie,"" said Kenneth hotly. ""They lied then, like anything,"" was the reply. ""Ever hear of my father?"" asked Grafton with a little swagger. ""He's Peter Hyde, the lumber magnate."" ""What's a lumber magnet?"" said Kenneth. ""Magnate, not. ""I hope I'll like it. The catalogue said it was a very fine school. I trust I shall profit from my connection with it"" ""I didn't know you had company,"" said Grafton.. Kenneth heard the conversation between Joe and Hyde. The two men were talking about the Lower House Basket Ball Team. Kenneth asked if he could try out for the team. The conversation went on for some time. Kenneth was not so deeply immersed that he didn't hear the conversation.. ""Say, kid, you're' a wonder!"" sneered Grafton as he got up to go. ""I never saw anything so freshly green in my life! You're going to have a real nice time here at Hilltop"". ""Well, bring little Kenneth with you, Joe; I've got some picture books."" ""Thank you,"" said the new junior gratefully. ""Oh, don't mention it!"" And Grafton went out chuckling. ""You're the first fellow that ever bluffed Graft!"" he said.. ""I don't like him,"" said Kenneth decidedly. Only--he's the richest fellow in school and he can't forget it!"" said Kenneth. The new gymnasium, looks less than a hundred years old. Seventy-six feet by forty it is, built of red sandstone with freestone trimming.. The new boy at Hilltop was already growing to like the other students. He was introduced to a number of the fellows and pointed out others. At Hilltop the athletic rivalry was principally internal, between dormitory and dormitory. Each dormitory had its own football, baseball, hockey, tennis, track, basket ball, and debating, team, and rivalry was always intense.. Kenneth was a new boy in Lower House. Most fellows liked what they saw of Kenneth, even while regretting that he wasn't old enough and big enough for football material. Kenneth bore the scrutiny without embarrassment, but nevertheless he was glad when Joe joined him where he sat on the edge of the stage. He was glad to have Joe.. ""I don't understand about the classes here,"" said Kenneth. ""I heard that big chap over there say he couldn't play because he was 'advanced' or something. What's that!"" Joe slipped off the stage and scurried across to where a boy of about sixteen, a tall, athletic-looking youth with reddish-brown hair was crossing the floor with a ball under each. Kenneth's first week at Hilltop passed busily and happily. There had been no more talk on Joe's part about getting rid of his roommate. The two had become fast friends. Kenneth grew to like Joe better each day; and it hadn't taken him long to discover that it was because of Joe's ability to squirm out of scrapes. Kenneth had erred, if at all, on the side of modesty when speaking of his basket-ball ability. Randall looked upon him as a model student and was delighted to have him in the house. He was light in weight for a team where the members' ages averaged almost sixteen years. He made up for that in speed, while his prowess at shooting baskets from the floor. ""Grafton was a hard, rough player and he didn't handle Kenneth with gloves,"" he says. ""On the other. Lower House held an enthusiastic meeting at which songs and cheers were practiced. The forty odd fellows in attendance pledged themselves for various sums of money to defray the cost of new suits and paraphernalia for both the basket ball and hockey teams. The championship shield went to the team winning two games out of three--Lower House.. The following afternoon Upper and Lower Houses turned out en masse to see the first of the hockey series. The supporters of the blue-stockinged players along the opposite barrier gleefully shouted the names of their rivals. ""Eat 'em up, Upper! Eat 'emup, Upper!"" they shouted.. ""He thinks I'm such a nice little boy and says he hopes my heart is of gold to match my hair!"" Joe groaned. ""Even defeat has its lesson, you know. Now--"" Kenneth didn't hear the rest. Grafton Hyde was beside him with a slip of paper in his. ""Only a dollar seemed rather little, and I wanted to be sure--"" Joe said. Kenneth smiled sarcastically. ""We don't make public the amounts received,"" answered Grafton with much dignity.. ""You'd better get moved to Upper, Garwood; that's where you belong,"" he said. ""I subscribed what I thought proper and you've refused to accept it. You haven't worried me."" But a glance over the faces of the little throng showed that public sentiment was. Kenneth swung around and faced the instructor. ""I don't believe you've got any right to criticise the size of my subscription until you've given something yourself,"" he said. Mr. Whipple's smile grew strained and uneasy.. ""Perhaps it is best to keep the donations confined to the student body,"" he said. ""Perhaps at another time you'll allow--"" ""Right now, sir!"" cried Joe. ""Give us a couple of dollars, sir"" ""I'll send you a receipt, sir,"" said Grafton.. Kenneth, who had kept his back turned since his last words, swung around with an angry retort on his lips. Joe. Kenneth and Joe were playing a game of football. Joe was upset that Kenneth had made a fuss about the subscription. Kenneth was not happy with Joe's attitude. The game ended with the score 18 to 7 in Upper's favor. Kenneth realized that Joe would hold him partly accountable for it.. ""I'm going to see Jim Marble before Graft gets at him with a lot of yarns about you,"" Joe continued"

""Which means I'm not one of the best,"" said Jerry with a grin. ""No, it doesn't,"" replied his roommate. ""It just means that you aren't very well known yet;"". ""What the dickens do you want me to do? Burn down Academy Hall or chuck one of the Faculty in the river?"" inquired Jerry sarcastically. ""Oh, you know what I mean,"" answered Ned a trifle impatiently.. ""I knew he'd keep me out if he could,"" Jerry replied dryly. ""He doesn't care for me much."" ""Well, I guess that's so,"" answered Ned thoughtfully. ""The fact is, Jerry,. ""I spoiled his fun for him,"" said one of the boys. ""Don't you bother. I'll get you elected before Class Day, Jerry."" ""Grab your skates and come on down to the river,"" said the other.. Ned and Jerry were skating in the Peterboro River. The river was swollen by melting snow and ice. The weather had turned rainy. Ned said he'd meet them at four. Jerry was disappointed.. Jerry wondered whether Ned couldn't have got him in if he had tried real hard. It meant a good deal to win election to the Lyceum, and, in spite of what he had told Ned, he had all along entertained a sneaking idea that he would. Jerry watched him emerge below, jump a miniature rivulet flowing beside the board walk and disappear around the corner of the dormitory. Then he got into his sweater, put his cap on, and in turn descended the stairs to the village.. Jerry decided to take the river path, for a glance at his shoes and stockings convinced him that it was no longer necessary to consider them. He felt rather more cheerful after his tramp, and told himself that if there was time he would run up to the room,. Jerry was skating with a group of skaters. They were lined up along the edge of the ice in little groups. Then several of them turned and skated frantically toward the bank. Jerry's first thought was that some one had fallen into the water.. Jerry saw a figure huddled on hands and knees a full fifty feet away from his companions. For an instant Jerry couldn't understand. Then the huddled figure was swept farther away toward the opposite shore. One of the fellows had ventured too far, the ice had broken away, and now he was being borne swiftly down the stream.. Jerry could be of no more use up there than were the fellows grouped helplessly at the edge of the ice. If the boy was to be rescued it must be downstream somewhere, always supposing the cake of ice hung together and that he managed to retain his place on it.. Jerry saw with a sinking heart that already the cake had diminished in size. He prayed for strength to keep on as he glanced again over his shoulder. The boy had thrown himself face down on the ice. If it struck one of the stone pillars of the bridge it would go to pieces.. Jerry looked down into the horror-stricken eyes of Herbert Welch. He had thrown himself down on the floor of the bridge, his head and shoulders over the water. Welch staggered weakly to his knees, the ice beneath. Jerry Welch's hands stretched down over the rushing water. He felt the blood rushing to his head and throbbing there mightily. He thought he heard cries, but the roar of the water beneath and the throbbing in his head made it uncertain.. Jerry Hutton was taken to a cottage at the edge of the village. He was lying on a couch in a cottage in a village. There were several figures about him, and one was Ned's. He smiled and tried to rise, but was glad to lay back. ""Not hurt a bit. He walked home."

If you have failed I shall have no further need of you"" ""Very well,"" dad answered. ""We'll call it settled. Want to try it?"". ""Raymond, this is Mr. John Twigg, your new tutor,"" said dad. Twigg held out his hand, and so I shook with him. He shook different from the others; sort of as though he had bones and things inside his fingers instead of cotton wool.. Dad's face got purple like it always does when he's mad, and his hands shook. For a moment I thought he was going to jump for me; he never has, no matter how mad he gets. Then he leaned back again in his chair and turned to Twigg with a beast of a sneer on. ""Sit still,"" said dad, ""and I'll get the cart around. Or you can write your message and I'll have Forbes send it."" ""Thanks,"" said Twigg, ""I'd like the walk."" He turned to me. ""Want to. ""I found Twigg kept a diary. He went to the city on the Wednesday afternoon after he came, and I rubbered around to see what I could find. The diary was in his table drawer. It was awful dull rot until I got to the last page or two"" ""I can scarcely believe that a boy of 16 can really be as absolutely unmoral as he. R. D. was the only child of a woman who died at his birth. He has been left to the care of servants for the past three years. He is fond of outdoor life; likes horses, dogs and animals generally. He rides well; shoots and fishes. I am the seventh in line to attempt the work of raising him.. ""I shall begin at the bottom with him. It's going to be a hard pull, but I'm going to win out"" ""You haven't studied a lick, have you?"" ""Not a lick,"" I answered. ""Oh, poppycock, my boy."" He. ""Don't you want to go to college?"" he asked. ""No; not if I've got to study all that darned stuff."" "". ""There's as good trout and pickerel fishing here as there is anywhere in the State, if you know the proper place to look for it,"" he said. ""It's an out-of-the-way spot up here, anyway,"" he added. ""I know. ""Too sunny, isn't it?"" he asked. ""You come with me and I'll show you fish."" ""You can take my split bamboo--if you won't go and bust it."". Raymond: ""You've forgotten the books."" ""Oh, let 'em wait,"" he says. ""Only you can't make me study, you know."" ""You make me sick,"" I say. ""How many lines were we to have. The day after we went fishing, and got fourteen trout, I had early breakfast and rode Little Nell over to Harrisbridge and played pool with Nate Golden, whose dad has the livery stable. When I got back it was nearly three o'clock. Tommy, the stable boy, told me as I rode in that Twigg had left. ""Don't smoke while lessons are going on, please,"" he said. ""Will if I like,"" I said. But just the same I kept a sharp eye on him. ""One thing at a time, eh? We'll have a quiet smoke first and lessons afterwards"". ""None of your darned business,"" I said warmly. He took up a book, one of Marryat's, crossed his legs and began to read. Gee! how that old pipe smelled! I laid on the bed and watched him blowing big gray clouds out under the corner of his mustache. ""Don't be silly,"" he said, just as though he were talking to a kid. ""I'm not going to study. You can keep me here all night and I won't study!"" After a while it began to get darkish. I went back. ""Yes,"" I muttered, ""I've read this, of course"" ""Ever read 'Treasure Island'?"" ""No; who's it by?"" ""Stevenson"" "". ""You stop smoking that smelly thing in my room,"" I said. ""Just remember, however, that it was I who objected to smoking in the first place."" There was a knock at the door and Annie asked if we were there. ""Please tell Mr. Dale that. ""You--you think you're smart, don't you?"" I sobbed. ""I'll--I'll get even for this, you bet!"" ""If we get through by nine we'll look for it,"" he said.. ""No man has any right to starve you,"" he said. ""If he was here I'd get him to lick you!"" ""Lucky for me he isn't here, eh?"" ""I had dinner at Harrisbridge with Nate Golden."" ""I put a pillow over my head so he wouldn't hear me crying"". Twigg was a Sissy; he was about nineteen and didn't have any mustache or muscle, and he couldn't do a thing except study and play patience. He could catch fish and ride fine, and could beat me at target shooting with a .32 rifle. He told me one day that he was stroke on his crew for two years..

""I was going over to Harrisbridge to see Nate Golden, but I didn't want to tell Twigg because he was so cranky; always trying to keep me at home"" ""I knew it would take Twigg two or three minutes to saddle Sultan, and by that time I could be out of reach"" ""But Twigg is always doing things you don't expect him to"". ""If it's a race you're after you can have it with me now!"" says the legendary rider. ""I touched Nell with the spur and she laid back her ears and just flew!"" ""That mile didn't last long, I tell you. I couldn't hear a sound"" ""I was pretty sure Twigg wouldn't know which way I'd gone"". ""I kind of wished I hadn't been so darned smart,"" said the boy. ""Twigg had such fool ideas on some things, like keeping his word to you and all that"" ""I knew Nell could beat that beast and so I slowed down,"" said Twigg.. ""This is the Harrisbridge road, isn't it?"" he asked. I thought at first you were trying to give me the slip, but I knew you'd said. ""I'm going in to town to-morrow, Raymond; want to come along?"" ""Yes,"" I said. ""I suppose you'll go there when you're ready, eh?"" ""Might as well go to one as another,"" said I. ""I suppose you won't be there,"" I said, flicking Nell's ear with my crop.

0.48,0.58,39.93933265925177,"""If they hadn't gone and made Don captain last year,"" said Satterlee, 2d, plaintively. ""That's where the trouble is."" ""How do you know I can't play second as well as they?"" says I. ""Well, how do youknow I can't play second?"" says the boy. ""Look here, Kid,"" he said, ""there's no use your wanting to play on second because there's Henen. Tom Pierson, a sophomore, was asked to play in the outfield. He refused, saying he didn't want to be accused of boosting his brother over their heads. ""I like it here. I think Willard's the best school in the country,"" he said. ""So do I, of course,"" answered Satterlee, 2d. ""Wish I did."". ""You and 'Old Crusty' seem awfully thick these days,"" mused the other. ""Wish he'd be as easy on me as he is on you,"" said Satterlee, 2d. ""But don't you want to get up to college?"" ""I'm in no hurry; you see, there's math; I'm not doing so badly at it now since Bailey has been helping me, but.

""Guess you never knew me to forget dinner time, did you?"" asked Satterlee, 2d, with a laugh. ""We'll have to hurry, though; you don't want to forget that dinner's half an hour earlier to-day"" The two boys sat nursing their knees on the terrace above the playground. Behind them in camp chairs sat Mr. and Mrs. Satter Lee.. Durham had two men on bases with two out and one of her heavy hitters was at bat. But the hit had been weak and long before he reached the bag the ball was snuggling in Donald Satterlee's mitten. Up on the terrace the Willardians breathed their relief. The game was won by Durham in the last half of the third inning and Willard's was in the field. The match was played in front of a crowd of 1,000 people at the school hall.. ""That's Fearing, our catcher, going to bat, sir,"" said Satterlee, 2d. ""He's going to try,"" answered his youngest son with a smile. ""But he isn't going to succeed, I guess,"" he muttered a minute later. ""That's Cook,"" answered Tom. ""And who is that boy?"" asked Mrs. Satterley. ""Cook,"" answered Mr. Sitterlee.. Willard Brown, third base-man, and was thrown out at first after having advanced Cook to second. Durham's third baseman gathered in the short fly that the batsman sent up and so ended the inning. ""He didn't do much last time,"" objected Satterlee, 2d, ""even if he is such a wonder"". Carpenter, who played third base for the visitors, was a tall, light-haired youth with a reputation for batting prowess. In the first game of the series Carpenter's hitting had been the deciding feature. Three one-baggers, a two-bagger, and a home-run had been credited to him when the game was over. It was the home- run, smashed out with a man on third in the eighth inning, which had defeated Willard's.. Durham scored four runs in the first half of the game but Willard's had no more. The score was level at 1-1 after five innings but the score book was still empty in the sixth. The game ended in a draw. Durham won the game 4-2. The match was played at the Hampton Stadium in London. The final score was 1-0. The win was Durham's first in six games. The last time they had won a game at the same venue was in 1968, when they won 3-2. Durham's Willardians were playing a game against Willard. Willings, who had so far pitched a remarkable game, suddenly went ""into the air"" The coach and his catcher hurled taunting words at the pitcher. The pitcher believed in doing the unexpected and threw the ball wide. The runner sped toward second and Carpenter raced home. But Beeton, right-fielder, had been wide-awake. The game was won by Durham.. Captain Don Satterlee's son, Willings, was playing for Durham. Willings hit a ball so fast that it caught the catcher, Fearing, a yard away from it. Fearing was able to catch the ball and score the winning run. The game ended in a draw. The team went on to win the World Series, the first in the history of the sport. The Satterlees' son, Don, later became a professional baseball player.. ""You can play or not, just as you like. But you don't have to be ugly about it,"" said Satterlee. ""You've got along without me so far and I guess you can finish,"" said the elder. ""I guess it doesn't make much difference who plays this game,"" said Don ungraciously.. The teams changed places and once more the teams change places. Durham started out with a batting streak and almost before anyone knew it the bases were full with but one out. A slightly built, sandy-haired man, with bright blue eyes and a look of authority, approached the group and Don, with a muttered apology, joined him. ""He's instructor in Greek and German, and he's a peach! The fellows call him 'Curly' on. The eighth inning opened with Don Satterlee at bat. An in-shoot caught the batsman on the thigh and he limped to first. Meyer--""Chick"" Meyer, as Tom triumphantly explained--sent him to second and gained first for himself, owing to an error. Then came an out. Beeton followed with a scratch hit just back of shortstop and the bases were full. Up on the terrace the cheering was continuous. Williams was struck out. But the next man flied out to left fielder and the cheering died away. But 2 to. Don Satterlee stepped up to the plate and the cheerers demanded a home-run. But the best the red's captain could do was a clean drive into right field that was good for one base for himself and a tally for the man on second. That made the score 3 to 4. Meyer sent the captain to second but was thrown out at first. The cheering went on and on. When the tumult was over he was sitting on second base. It seemed that at last fortune was to favor the red.. Don Satterlee, 2d, felt rather limp when he faced the pitcher. His heart was pounding somewhere up near his mouth and it made him feel uncomfortable. Down on second Fearing was watching him anxiously. On first Beeton was dancing back and forth, while behind him Brother Don coaching hoarsely and throwing doubtful glances in the direction of the plate. The score was tied. Another tally would tie the score.. Satterlee, 2d, smarting under his brother's contempt, felt his nerves steady and when the second delivery came he was able to judge it and let it go by. That made a ball and a strike. Then came another ball. They had told him to wait for a good one, and he was going to do it. And presently the good one came. The ball came to earth, was gathered up on its first bound and sped toward the plate. But it reached the catcher too late, for Fearing and Beeton had tallied.. The score had changed to 6-4, and the 6 was Willard's. But there was still a half inning to play and Durham had not lost hope. A two-base hit would surely tie the score, while one of the home-runs of which Carpenter was believed to be capable--such a one as he made in the first game of the series--would send Willard’s into mourning. The terrace was almost deserted, for the spectators were lined along the path to first base.. Carpenter was on his way to first. Satterlee, 2d, was out in center field, hoping for a chance to aid in warding off the defeat that seemed inevitable. Carpenter tapped the plate with the end of his bat and waited calmly. Another ball. Then a second strike. And for a brief moment Willard's shouted hoarsely. And then there was a sharp sound of bat meeting ball. The ball was a low fly to short center field. Neither Carpenter nor the runners on first and second dreamed for a moment that it could be. Satterlee, 2d, needed no coaching. He was almost too late--but not quite. His hands found the ball a bare six inches above the turf. Coming fast as he was he had crossed second base before he could pull himself up. He tossed the ball nonchalantly toward the pitcher's box and walked toward the bench. The game was over. But he never reached the bench that day. He died in a car crash in 2009. He is survived by his wife and two children.. On the way around the field he caught once a fleeting vision of Brother Don's red, grinning countenance beaming commendation, and once a glimpse of the smiling faces of his father and mother"

He had taken the ""A.M."" degree the preceding June at a Western university, and had entered his name in the long list of those wishing to be teachers. September found him without a position. During the fall and early winter he waited with what philosophy he could summon. He studied doggedly, having in view the attainment of a Ph.D. ""Curly's real name was Isaac Newton Stone. He was the son of a schoolmaster and a schoolmistress. His father was a teacher at Willard's School, and his mother was a governess."". Isaac Newton Stone, A. M. D. was hired as an instructor at Willard's School in February. He was small, slight and wiry, with pale blue eyes, a tip-tilted nose and a fresh pink-and-white complexion. Three days after his advent he had become universally known as Curly. He thought he saw his authority endangered, his dignity assailed. The ringleaders in the affair, five in number, were placed upon probation in exactly two seconds. Such a thing had never happened before. Such an incident had never been reported before. The class gasped. The school had never had such a thing happen before. It was a first.. The role of iron-heeled despot was least of all suited to Curly or desired by him, but having momentarily adopted it, he had to continue it. He dared not take the frown from his face for a moment; intimidation was his only course. Once or twice Curly's punishments were not upheld. In May he was informed that unless he could maintain discipline without such severity the faculty would be forced to the painful necessity of asking his resignation. His election, the principal explained kindly, had been in the nature of an experiment, and unsuccessful experiments must of course be terminated. It was June now, and class day was but two weeks distant. This morning there had been trouble in the German class, and as a result, two students had been placed on probation. The fact that one of them, Rogers, was the best pitcher in school,. The letter was brief, yet it took him nearly ten minutes. He had made no attempt at explanation or extenuation, but had thanked the faculty for their kindness and patience, regretted their disappointment, and begged them to accept his resignation. He subscribed himself ""Respectfully yours, Isaac Newton Stone,"" sealed the letter and addressed it to the principal. Footsteps sounded in the echoing corridor, and a flushed, perspiring face peered into the room. Then a boy of 16 hurried up the aisle. ""Mr. Stone, sir,"" he cried, ""will you help us? It's the beginning of the sixth inning, and the score's eight to six in our favor. Will you help them?"" ""Yes,"" he said.. ""But who said I could pitch, Turner?"" ""Tom Apthorpe's cousin, sir; he's down for Sunday"" ""But how did he know?"" ""He knew you at college, and--"" ""Run back and tell them I'll come as soon as I leave this note at Dr. Willard's"" ""I don't quite understand!"" ""Why, sir, we held 'em down until the fifth, and then they made six runs!"" ""If you could only come right away!"". ""Come on, Turner!"" he cried. ""Couldn't you come now, sir?"" he begged. ""It may be too late. They're batting like anything"" ""Well, may be I could,"" said Curly. He dropped it into his pocket, put on his hat and strode down the aisle. It was not a Willard cheer. ""Come on!"" he said. ""I'll be there in a minute."" ""I've got a note for you,"" he said, ""and I'll leave it for you"" ""I will be there,"" he replied, ""in a minute,"" and left the note in his pocket. ""And I'll be back in a few minutes,"" he added.. Newt Stone was a pitcher and star batsman on our old class nine. Tom Apthorpe, my cousin, was bewailing the fact that he hadn't anyone to pitch. Inquiries elicited the astounding fact that 'Curly' was none other than Newt Stone. I told him to hurry up and get you out. I was awfully glad to see you again. You're badly needed. ""I never thought to find you in this part of the world, Stone,"" said Harris. ""You're a good baseball player. You'll be a great addition to the team"". ""I'm afraid I'm all out of practice,"" objected Curly. ""I haven't handled a ball for two years, but I'll do what I can."" ""I wish you'd come round to my room afterwards and have a talk, if you've nothing better to do"" ""I don't think we fellows have much right to ask you to help us out, but if you'll do it for the school, sir, everyone will be mighty glad"" ""For the school!"" Curly wondered rather bitterly what the school had done for him that he should come to her rescue. ""For goodness' sake, Stone, get into the box and strike out some of those boys from Durham! The score's. ""I'll do what I can, Apthorpe,"" Curly Stone says. ""Three times three for Curl--for Mr. Stone,"" a boy calls. ""I'll give you a ball,"" Curl says. The two agree on a few simple signals, the umpire calls, ""Play!"" and the game goes on again. ""Curly looked over the field, glanced carelessly at the runner, turned, and sent a swift, straight ball over the plate,"" he writes. ""It was the first half of the sixth inning; the score was eight to eight."" ""I'm a little bit of a baseball madman,"" says Curly, ""but I'm not a bad one."". Durham's next man up was her catcher. Curly strove to wipe out the intervening two years and to imagine himself back at college, pitching for his class in the final championship game. But alas! his arm was stiff and muscle-bound, and creaked in the socket every time he threw. The runner on first took second unmolested, and the Durham coaches yelled themselves hoarse. But Curly was not to be rattled in that way; and besides, the stiffness was wearing out of his arm. He set his lips together and pitched the ball. The umpire called a strike and the crowd cheered. The game was won by Durham, 2-1. The match was played in front of a crowd of 3,000.. The last of the sixth inning ended without a score. Not a Durham player reached first base. The fielders, as they joined him, shot curious and admiring glances toward him. Harris leaned over the bench and talked with him about the incidents of old college games. And the boys near by listened, while the curly-haired instructor grew before their eyes into an athletic hero. The new pitcher, his eyes sparkling, retired to the bench. Pretty as it was to watch, the first of the seventh would make tame history. The game would end in a tie.. Durham's best hitter was Mansfield, the instructor, who played first base. One--two--three was the way they struck out. The second half of the inning was much more exciting than the first half. The team was composed entirely of students, for almost the first time, Willard's team had been, until to-day, composed entirely. of students. The peculiar custom of recruiting baseball and football players from the faculty originated at Willard’s and Durham is not known; but it was a privilege that each enjoyed and made use of whenever possible.. Mansfield had been playing with Durham all spring, and to his excellent fielding and hitting was largely due to the fact that she had won the second of the three games. Mansfield was caught a yard from the base. He retired in chagrin, while Willard's cheered ecstatically. The umpire called another strike. The little knot of Durhamites shrieked joyfully and waved their cherry-and-white banners. The next batsman, tried him with a ""drop,"" at which he promptly struck and failed to hit. Curly watched him out of the corner of his eye and pitched again.. The third man made a leisurely hit and was thrown out at first. Then the batsman struck out on a slow drop ball. The spectators suggested ten innings, and fell to recalling former long-drawn contests. They wished they had known he was such a ball player early in the spring. Next year he would play on the team, would he not? Curly remembered the letter in his pocket and sighed. He had found his pace, as Harris put it. The ninth inning began with the score still eight to eight. It was the last game of the season.. Durham made the supreme effort of the contest in that first half of the ninth inning. The first man struck out as ingloriously as his predecessors; but the second batsman, after knocking innumerable fouls, made a slow bunt and reached his base. At that Durham's supporters found encouragement, and her cheers rose once more. ""Good old 'Newt' Stone!"" he muttered. ""It's the little chaps, after all, who have the pluck!"" ""It was a great game of baseball,"" said the announcer. ""I was in awe of the little boys' ability to play the game."" ""I'm still in awe today,"" said one of the players.. The third man up was struck on the elbow with the ball, and trotted gleefully to first, the player ahead going to second. But Curly caught the runner on first napping, and the next batsman struck out. The spectators fidgeted in their seats; the field was almost quiet. Then fate threw a sop to the wearers of the cherry and white. The blue-stockinged players came in from the field. ""Stone at bat!"" called the scorer. ""Brown on deck!"" ""A run would do it, sir"". Willard Apthorpe was on third in the sixth inning of a game against the New York Yankees. He was running for second when he hit a fly ball to the center fielder. The ball hit Curly, who was sliding to first, and Curly was safe. Apth orpe then hit a sacrifice fly to advance Curly to third. The umpire dropped his hand and the play was stopped. The game was won by the Yankees, and the game was played in New York City's Wrigley Field. The Yankees went on to win the World Series, beating the Yankees 4-1. The series was the first in the Yankees' history. The last game was the last in the series, which the Yankees won 3-1 in the ninth. Curly was ten feet from the base when ball met bat. He struck again at the next ball, and again missed. But he found the next balls, and drove it swift and straight at the pitcher. The dust was in his eyes and nostrils. He felt a corner of the plate. He launched himself through space, with arms outstretched. He worked his arms like pistons and his legs like driving shafts. He was flying along the line. His arms were outstretched, and he was flying through space.. The home nine had won game and championship. Everywhere pandemonium reigned. Two minutes later the cherry-colored banners of Durham departed, flaunting bravely in the face of defeat. Willard's danced across the terrace, shouting and singing. The crowd was in raptures. The game was won by the home nine. The match was played in front of a crowd of 6,000. The score was 1-0. The home team won the game and the championship. The team was Durham, the home team of the North East of England.. Curly and Harris sat together in the former's study. Curly held a sealed and addressed letter in his hands, which he turned over and over undecidedly. ""Let me have it, please,"" said Harris, with decision. He tore the letter across, and tossed the pieces into the waste basket. ""That's the only thing to do with that,"" he said. And in the successful two years of teaching since then Curly has come to feel that Harris was quite right."

This doctor, who tells the story I am about to relate, was not like the usual Atlantic physician. He was older than the average, and, to judge by his somewhat haggard, rugged face, had seen hard times and rough usage in different parts of the world. Why he came to settle down on an Atlantic steamer--a berth which is a starting-point rather than a terminus--I have no means of knowing. This is the doctor's story--until he tells it to you, of course. The ladies, at least, would be unanimous in saying that the doctor is one of the most charming officials onBoard the ship. The doctor is a charming man, and he will tell you his story to you if you ask him.. ""I am not sure that I am doing quite right in telling this story,"" said the doctor. ""I don't know exactly what the United States Government might have in store for me if the truth came to be known"" The doctor's story relates to a case of fever, which caused the death of the celebrated Indian chief Wolf Tusk. The story was told by the doctor to a group of doctors at the University of California, Los Angeles. The doctor said that he had never told the story to them before, but that he was compelled to do so. He said he was not sure whether he had acted rightly or wrongly in the matter he was telling them about. The doctors asked him to tell them what the slip of paper said, and he said that it was an extract from one of the U.S. Government Reports in the Indian department. He then told them the story of the death.. ""There is no question but Wolf Tusk was an old monster,"" he says. ""The men who dealt with him had been grievously,"" he adds. ""Each one will say for himself whether he would have acted as I did or not"" ""I will make my excuses at the end of the story,"" he writes. ""I have not a copy of it, and have to quote from memory"" ""Wolf Tusk died at four o'clock in the afternoon, having been in great pain, and, during the latter part, delirious, he died,"" says the author. ""He was buried near the spot where he had taken ill,"" adds the author, ""and was buried in the same place"" ""He had been wounded in the battle of the day before, when he was captured, and the fever attacked all parts of his body,"" the author adds.. ""What I have read you,"" said the physician, folding up the paper again, and placing it in his pocket-book, ""is strictly and accurately true, otherwise, of course, I would not have so reported to the Government. Wolf Tusk was the chief of a band of irreconcilables, who were now in one part of the West and now in another, giving a great deal of trouble to the authorities. This was signed by the doctor."" The doctor then signed the document, which was then sent to the British Government. The letter was sent on the advice of the British ambassador to the United States, and was sent back to London on the same day as the letter was received. The doctor also signed the letter, which is now in the British government's possession. The British ambassador then sent the letter back to the UK, and it was sent to London.. ""Wolf Tusk and his band, knowing there would be trouble, had made for the broken ground,"" says historian. ""The alarm, however, was speedily given, and a company of troops from the nearest fort started in hot pursuit"" The men who had gone with the troops were forced to abandon their horses. ""When the men returned, they found nothing but heaps of smouldering ruin,"" says author. ""It was a terrible sight to see,"" adds historian. 'The men who went with them had to leave their horses behind. It was a horrible sight to watch."" ""The men whose families had been killed, and who were all mounted on swift horses, begged permission to go with the soldiers,"" adds author. 'It was known that their leader would take them after Wolf Tusk on his own account, and it was thought better to have every one engaged in. Wolf Tusk, who had been wounded, and had his horse shot under him, did not succeed in escaping. The two flanking parties now having reunited with the main body, it was decided to keep the Indians on the run for a day or two at least, and so a question arose as to the disposal of the wounded chief. He could not be taken with the fighting party; there were no soldiers to spare to take him back. The leader of the settlers said that as they had had enough of war, they would convey him to the fort. Why the commander allowed this to be done, I do not know. He must have realized the feelings of thesettlers towards the man who massacred their wives and children. However, the request of the settler was acceded to, and I was ordered back also, as I had been slightly wounded. I was later ordered back as I was also wounded. The story of Wolf Tusk is told in the novel, ""The Last of the Mohawk"". ""The commander thought I had better get back into the fort, as he was certain there would be no more need of my services"" ""The Indians were on the run, and would make no further stand. Wolf Tusk was given one of the captured Indian horses. I attended to the wound in his leg, and he was strapped on the horse, so that there could be no possibility of his escaping"" ""I was somewhat rudely awakened, and found myself tied hand and foot, with two or three of the settlers standing over me"" ""We camped the first night in a little belt of timber that bordered a small stream"". ""What are you going to do? What is the meaning of this?' I said to them in astonishment. They helped me to my feet, then half carried and half led me to a tree, where they tied me securely to the trunk"" ""Then I noticed that Wolf Tusk was tied to a. tree in a manner similar to myself, and around him had been collected a quantity of firewood. This firewood, was not piled up to his feet, but formed a circle at some distance. from him, so that the Indian would be slowly roasted"" ""There is no use in my describing what took place,"" he said. ""It was a terrible experience."". ""Wolf Tusk"" was tortured for two weeks before he was killed. ""You have made every effort to save him by trying to break loose, and you have not succeeded,"" said the leader. ""I said I would, and I did,"" said Tusk. ""We are not going to harm you, even though you refuse to sign this report,"" he said. ""All you can do is to put more trouble on the heads of men who have already, through red devils like this, had more trouble than they can well stand and keep sane"" ""I will sign the report,"" Tusk replied. ""Because I am a man of the people."" ""I am not afraid of you,"" he added, ""and I will not let you kill me."""
0.26,0.36,25.272975432211105,"The story was written in the days when drawing-rooms were dark and filled with bric- a-brac. The woman was the wife of the son of the richest man in America. She was weeping softly, and had just made up her mind that she was the most miserable. Druce eloped with the artists' model, celebrated for her loveliness. The first inkling old man Druce had of the affair was from a vivid sensational account of the runaway in an evening paper. He was pictured in the paper as an implacable father who was at that moment searching for the elopers with a shot. Druce was a taciturn man, even with his only son. He was bewildered rather than enlightened when Ed told him he feared opposition because the girl was poor. What difference on earth did that make? Had he not money enough for all of them?. Druce expressed the utmost contempt for such a state of things. assured the old man that cases had been known where a suspicion of mercenary motives had hovered round a matrimonial alliance. The girl sprang from her chair and threw her arms around his neck, much to the old. The old man became almost genial whenever he thought of his pretty daughter-in-law. ""My little girl,"" he always called her. Wall Street men said old Druce was getting into his dotage, but when a nip came in the market and they found. Druce had small, shifty piercing eyes that peered out from under his grey bushy eyebrows like two steel sparks. He never seemed to be looking directly at any one, and his eyes somehow gave you the idea that they were trying to glance back over his shoulder, as if he feared pursuit.. ""Nobody could be kinder to me than Ed. is. There is nothing really the matter,"" she said. ""Money?"" he asked in an eager whisper. ""Oh dear no. I have all the money, and more, that. ""You must be mistaken. Good gracious, I am worth ten times what old Sneed is. Not good enough?"" ""It isn't a question of cheques, papa,"" wailed the girl. ""It's a question. of society. I was a painter's model. ""Character does not count in society,"" said the young girl. ""But society can't have anything against you,"" said her father. ""I'll speak to Gen. Sneed to-morrow,"" he said, brightening.. Sneed was known in New York as the General, probably because he had absolutely no military experience whatever. Next to Druce he had the most power in the financial world of America. If it came to a deal in which the General and all the world stood against Druce, the average Wall Street man would have bet on. Druce and Sneed were in a remote corner where more ruin had been concocted than on any other spot on earth. When they saw Sneed take out his note-book, nodding assent to whatever proposition Druce was making, a cold shiver ran up New York.. ""Look here, General,"" said Druce, ""I want you to do me a favour"" ""I'm with you,"" replied the General. ""It's about my little girl,"" continued Druce. ""Oh! About Ed. ""I don't suppose they mean anything by it, but my little girl thinks they do, so I said I would speak to you about it"" ""Well, I'm glad you did. I'll see to that the moment I get home. What time shall I tell them to call?"". The two men met, and after a word or two they walked up and down together. Druce appeared to be saying little, and the firm set of his lips did not relax. The General talked rapidly and was seemingly making some appeal.. Druce's silence encouraged the General to take it for assent. Bracing up after removing the moisture from his forehead, he took on an expostulatory tone. ""See here, Druce, hang it all, don't shove a man into a corner. It's all dumb nonsense, any. ""If my little girl wanted the whole Wabash System I'd buy it for her to-morrow,"" said Druce, with rising anger. ""Lord! what a slump that would make in the market!"" cried the General, his feeling of discomfort being momentarily overcome by the magnificence. ""About three millions' worth,"" replied the General, brightening up, now that they were off the thin ice. ""That will be enough for me if we can make a dicker"" ""Will you come with me for a blow on the sea?"". Druce's yacht, the Seahound, was a magnificent steamer, almost as large as an Atlantic liner. It was believed in New York that Druce kept her for the sole purpose of being able to escape in her, should an exasperated country ever rise in its might.. The Seahound was carrying the General and his wife to the coast. The fog was so thick that they had to stop and wait for the fog to clear. The captain was a shrewd man, and understood his employer's plans. The ship was eventually able to sail away.. The tug, in spite of all her efforts, did not seem to be gaining. When the yacht put on her speed the little steamer gradually fell farther and farther behind. When well out at sea something went wrong with the engines.. The General saw that his carriage was waiting for him, but the waning light did not permit him to recognise his son until he was up on dry land once more. The look on his son's face appalled the old man.. ""Where are the securities that were in the safe?"" asked John Sneed. ""Oh, they're all right,"" said his father, a feeling of relief coming over him. ""How did you know that the securities were not there?"" ""Because I had the safe blown open. ""I took his cheque on the Trust National Bank,"" said the young man. ""Did you cash it? Did you cash the money?"" cried the general. ""It's no use, John,"" he said. ""Old Druce has the. ""We're in the same business ourselves, only this time we got the hot end of the poker,"" says John Sneed. ""He played it low down on me, pretending to be friendly and all that"". General Sneed received a letter from a messenger. He recognised on the envelope the well- known scrawl of the great speculator. The General had refused himself to all the reporters, while young Sneed seemed to be able to do nothing but swear.. The Sneed girls called on Mrs. Edward Druce. Druce: I like you, Sneed, but you have no head for business. Seek my advice oftener. If your two daughters should happen to think as I do on the uncertainty of riches, I wish you would ask"
0.9,1.0,71.76560121765601,"Two actors walked through the streets of Chili during the war. They were part of a French dramatic company. The theatre was open on nights when a paying audience came. The two actors were talking about the stage. The war was raging outside the city gates, but the streets were full of people. The pair were talking of the stage, not of the real war. The play was called ""Theatre of the Stars"" and was written by Jacques Dupre. It was first performed in 1854. Theatre of The Stars is published by Picador at £16.99. For more information on the theatre, visit www.picador.co.uk/theatre ofthestars. For details on the play, go to www.theatreofthestars, www.pictor.com/ theatre.. ""You are all wrong, Dupre,"" cried Lemoine, ""all wrong. I have studied the subject"" ""Speak for yourself, Lemoine. You know I am green with jealousy of you. You are the rising star and I am setting"" ""You can't teach an old dog new tricks, Carl, my boy."" ""You are so good on the stage that I can't bear to see you false to your art just to please the gallery"" ""That's nonsense. I wish you would consider this seriously"" ""I am saying nothing against your acting in general. You have no greater admirer than I am"". ""How can a man be above his gallery--the highest spot in the house?"" ""Yes, you're flippant, simply because you know you're wrong, and dare not argue this matter soberly"" ""She stabs you in a spot so vital that you die in a few minutes"" ""No. False premises entirely. She says something about my wicked heart, and evidently intends to pierce that depraved organ"" ""A woman never hits what she aims at, and I deny that I'm ever stabbed through the heart"". ""Suppose she stabbed you, what would you do?"" ""I would plunge forward on my face--dead"" ""Oh, hang the curtain!"" ""Your friends in the gallery wouldn't know what had happened"" ""All is over"" ""Now you claim this is all wrong, do you?"" ""Yes, I do"" ""Well, then, hang it!"" ""All wrong"" ""Yes. All wrong."" ""Now, Carlos. Now you claim it is all right."" ""Yes!"" ""Yes! Now, Carlos, now you claim that it is!"" ""Great heavens! What would become of your curtain?"" ""Great. heavens!"" ""What would become?"" ""The curtain would come down!"". ""You can't portray life in a death scene, Carl."" ""I claim the actor has no right to hear applause--that he should not know there is such a thing as an audience"" ""You apparently won't see that I am very much in earnest about this."" ""Of course you are, my boy; and that is one reason why you will become a very great actor"" ""I am not a man of words, I am a person of words"" ""What do you want from me?"" ""I want to know what you think of me."" ""What would you like me to say to you, Carl?"" ""Would you like to tell me what you want to say?"" ""Yes, I would like to say that I would love to tell you what I think of you."" ""Do you know who I am?"" ""No, I don't."" ""Then what do you say to me?"". ""You mean I am a fool, and that I may learn wisdom with age?"" he asked. ""I quite admit you are a better actor than I am,"" he replied. ""But I will take you on your own ground. Have you ever seen a man stabbed or shot through the heart?"" ""I never have, but I know mighty well he wouldn't undo his necktie afterwards,"" he said. ""Who is flippant now?"" he laughed. ""Until you have seen aMan die from such a stab as I receive every night, I don't understand how you can justly find fault with my rendition of the tragedy"" ""I was ambitious myself once, but as we grow older"" --Dupre shrugged his shoulders-- ""well, we begin to have an eye on box- office receipts"". ""How are prospects to-night?"" asked the manager of the theatre. ""Very poor,"" replied the actor. ""I'm going to take a walk,"" said the manager, ""and then we'll talk again"" ""And when we come back, we'll discuss the future,"" said another, ""but for now, we're going for a walk."" ""And we're not going back,"" said a third, ""because we've got a play to finish."" ""We're going to the theatre,"" said one of the actors, ""where the play is going to be."" ""Yes,"" said an actor, ""the theatre,"" and then we're off to the next stage in the play."". ""We must begin,"" said the manager, lowering his voice, ""the President has ordered me not to close the theatre."" ""Oh, hang the President!"" cried Lemoine impatiently. ""Why doesn't he put a stop to the war, and then the theatre would remain open of its own accord?"" ""Balmeceda is a fool,"" retorted the younger actor. ""If he were out of the way, the war would not last another day"" ""I believe he is playing a losing game, anyhow,"" said Dupre.. ""I say what I think, and I don't care who hears me,"" says Lemoine. ""But you forget that we are, in a measure, guests of this country, and we should not abuse our hosts, or the man who represents them"" ""Ah, does he represent them?"" asks the manager. ""That's just what the war is about"" ""I have all an actor's vanity in that respect,"" says the Frenchman. ""I say, Lemoine, I wish you wouldn't talk like that,"" expostulated the manager gently, ""especially when there are so many listeners"". ""That may all be,"" said the manager almost in a whisper, for he was a man evidently inclined towards peace. ""But it does not rest with us to say so. We are French, and I think, therefore, it is better not to express an opinion"" ""I'm not French,"" cried Lemoine. ""I have a right to abuse my own country if I choose to do so."" ""I suppose,"" said Dupre, by way of putting an end to the discussion, ""it is time for us to get our war-paint on"" ""It's time for me to get my war paint on,"" replied the. Dupre whispered a word to the man who controlled the falling of the curtain, and when the actor, as the villain of the piece, received the fatal knife-thrust from the ill-used heroine, he plunged forward on his face and died without a struggle. The manager, who was watching the play from the front of the house, and to the evident bewilderment of the gallery, who had counted on an exciting struggle with death. The audience were not pleased to see him so suddenly shift his worlds without an agonising realisation of the fact that he was quitting an existence in which he had done nothing but evil. They were not happy to see the villain so suddenly change his worlds. The gallery was well filled, as was usually the case, but the audience was not pleased that the villain had changed his worlds, and that he had been killed.. The curtain came down upon the climax, but there was no applause, and the audience silently filtered out into the street. ""Good heavens, Dupre!"" he said, ""why did you end the piece in that idiotic way? What on earth got into you?"" ""The knife,"" said Dupre, flippantly. ""It went directly through the heart, and Lemoine here insists that when that happens a man should fall dead instantly. I did it to please Lemoine."" ""But you spoiled your curtain,"" protested the manager. ""Yes, I knew that would happen, and I told Lemoine so; but he insists on art for art's sake"" ""I fell perfectly flat, as you suggested, and you must have seen that the climax of the play fell flat also,"" replied Dupre. ""I don't want you to kill the play as well as yourself, you know, Dupre,"" says Lemoine. ""It all goes to show how we are surrounded and hampered by the traditions of the stage,"" says Dupre. ""The gallery wants to see a man die all over the place, and so the victim has to scatter the furniture about and make a fool of himself generally,"" adds the manager. ""There is no jumping-jack business in such a case,"" says the doctor. ""He doesn't play at leapfrog with the chairs and sofas, but sinks instantly to the floor and is done for."" ""Come along, Lemoine,"" cried Dupre, putting on his coat, ""and stop talking nonsense"" ""I don'st mind telling you both frankly that I don't intend to die in that way again. ""I don't believe you are correct in anything you say about the matter,"" said Dupre. ""I suppose the truth is that no two men die alike under the same circumstances"" ""Ah!"" sighed Lemoine, ""you are too careless, Dupre; you do not study enough. This kind of thing is all very well in Chili, but it will wreck your chances when you go to Paris"" ""No two men act alike when the heart is touched in love, why then should they when it's touched in death?"" ""No, I don't think so,"" replied Dupre, ""but if you want to know the truth, you'll have to go to the hotel and find out."" ""What absurd nonsense you talk!"" said Lemoine. ""You will throw your chances away. You do notStudy enough"". ""Unless the rebels take this city by storm, and that shortly, we may never see Paris again,"" said Dupre. ""I have no heart for anything but the heroine's knife. I am sick and tired of the situation here"" ""If you studied more deeply, Dupre, you would take Paris by storm,"" replied the man in charge. ""Thanks,"" said the actor lightly. ""But unless the rebelstake this city. The sergeant touched Lemoine on the shoulder, and said -- ""It is my duty to arrest you, sir."" Dupre asked, ""In Heaven's name, why?"" The man did not answer, but a soldier stepped to either side of Lemoine. Dupre found himself alone, with the squad and their prisoner disappearing down a back street. For a moment he stood there as if dazed, then he turned and ran as fast as he could, back to the theatre again, hoping to meet a carriage for hire on the way. The next instant Dupre was alone, and the squad had disappeared down a front street.. Dupre went to the theatre to find the lights out and the manager on the point of leaving. The manager seemed thunderstruck by the intelligence, and gazed helplessly at Dupre. ""They simply said they were acting under the President's orders,"" said the manager. ""You don't imagine,"" said Dupre, with a touch of pallor coming into his cheeks, ""that this is anything serious"" ""Lemoine has been talking recklessly. I never could get him to realise that he was in Chili, and that he must not be so free in his speech"" ""He always insisted that this was the nineteenth century, and a man could say what he liked,"" replied the manager, ""as if the nineteenthcentury had anything to do with a South American Republic."". The manager and his friend Lemoine went to the residence of the President. They were refused admittance, but finally allowed to wait in a small room. An hour passed, but still no invitation came to them from the President, who was due to be shot that morning. Lemoine had been tried by court-martial and condemned to death for sedition. He had been sentenced to death by the President by order of the president, and was to be killed at daybreak. The manager said: ""There is no time to be lost. We can probably get a carriage in the square"" The President said he regretted that it was impossible for him to see them that night, but that he would send them back to Paris the next day. He was shot at dawn the next morning. The story was published in the French magazine Le Monde in 1903. The French government never published the story again.. The President regretted having kept them waiting so long, but the court-martial had been sitting when they arrived, and the President thought that perhaps they would be interested in knowing the verdict. With that the officer escorted the two dumb-founded men to the door, where they got into their carriage without a word. The moment they were out of earshot the manager said to the coachman -- ""Drive as quickly as you can to the residence of the French Minister"" The Minister entered the room shortly after, and listened with interest to what they had to say. The President was not present, but his secretary consented to see them, and, on learning the seriousness of the case, he undertook to arouse his Excellency, and learn if anything could be done.. The Minister came in, and the two anxious men saw by his face that he had failed in his mission. ""I am sorry to say,"" said his Excellency, ""that I have been unable even to get the execution postponed. I did not understand, when I undertook the mission, that M. Lemoine was a citizen of Chili. You see that fact puts the matter entirely out of my hands. I am powerless."" ""I could only advise the President not to carry out his intentions,"" said the Minister. ""But he is to- night in a most unreasonable and excited mood, and I fear nothing can be done to save your friend"" ""Perhaps you will wait here until I return,"" replied the Minister, ""and I will come back in an hour"" ""And I will return,"" said one of the men, and ""and you will go home."". Dupre realised that Lemoine had sealed his own fate by his independence and lack of tact. If he had taken a conciliatory attitude at the court- martial, the result might not have been so disastrous. The utmost I could do, was to get the President to sign a permit for you to see your friend, if you present it at the prison before the execution takes place. I fear you have no time to lose. Here is the paper."" The prisoner was brought in between two soldiers. He had thrown off his coat, and appeared in his shirt sleeves. Lemoine predicted that he would, within two weeks, meet him in Hades. The two dejected men drove from the Legation and through the deserted streets to the prison. They were shown through several stone-paved rooms.. Lemoine was not manacled or bound in any way, there being too many prisoners for each one to be allowed the luxury of fetters. ""How comically life is made up of trivialities,"" said Lemoine. ""I remember once, in Paris, going with a friend to take the oath of allegiance to the French Republic."" ""And did you take it?"" cried Dupre eagerly. ""Alas, no! We met two other friends, and we all adjourned to a cafe and had something to drink"" ""I have the misfortune to be a citizen of this country,"" said Dupre. ""Of course he could do nothing, for, as I told you, I have. ""Then you know to what you are condemned,"" said the manager, with tears in his eyes. ""I hope you won't mind my death. I assure you I don't mind it myself,"" he said. ""The usurper has no soul for art, or anything else, for that matter"" ""I would much rather be shot than live in this confounded country any longer,"" he added. ""If I had taken the oath of allegiance, my friend, the French Minister, would have bombarded the city before he would have allowed the execution to go on."" ""I little thought that bottle of champagne was going to cost me my life,"" said Dupre, ""but then he always was a fool, and never knew what he was talking about"" ""The villain refused. The usurper had no soul,"" said Balmeceda, ""and I would show you how a man dies"". Lemmon's actions were so fast that no one realised what he was doing. He thrust the blade into his own breast, with no thought of the consequences. He then turned to face the crowd and said: 'I have made up my mind to cheat you all out of money' He then walked off, leaving his weapon in the middle of the room. The incident happened in front of a crowd of onlookers in a pub in London's West End. The story was later revealed in a book called 'The Man Who Stole My Life' by David Walliams, published by Simon & Schuster, £7.99, and available on Amazon.com.

The soldier staggered and fell against the whitewashed stone wall. His eyes turned helplessly towards Dupre, and he gasped out the words. ""My God! You were right--after all."" ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"" he said. ""I didn't mean to hurt you."" ""You're not hurt at all,"" Dupre replied."
0.84,0.94,69.79472140762464,"Dupre sat at one of the round tables in the Cafe Vernon, with a glass of absinthe before him, which he sipped every now and again. He looked through the open door, out to the Boulevard, and saw passing back and forth with the regularity of a pendulum, a uniformed policeman. Dupre laughed silently as he noticed this evidence of law and order. The Cafe Vernon was under the protection of the Government. The class to which Dupre belonged had sworn that it would blow the cafe into the next world, therefore the military-looking policeman walked to and fro on the pavement to prevent this being done. People were arrested now and then for lingering around the cafe: they were innocent, of course, and by-and-by the Government found that out and let them go. The real criminal seldom acts suspiciously. Most of the arrested persons were merely attracted by curiosity.. The cafe was well guarded, and M. Sonne, the proprietor of the cafe, had done a poor stroke of business for himself when he gave information to the police regarding the whereabouts of Hertzog. The cafe was suddenly the most noted one in the city, and that it now enjoyed the protection of the Government. So runs the world. It was evident that M.Sonne, who sat at the desk, nor at the waiter, who had helped the week before to overpower Hertsog. He seemed more intent on watching the minion of the law who paced back and forth in front of the door. He once glanced at the other minion who sat almost out of sight at the back of the Cafe, scrutinising all who came in, especially those who had parcels of any kind.. Dupre knew that his comrades were more given to big talk than to action. He more than suspected the police had agents among them. Hertzog had been a man of deeds not words. He had said to Dupre once, that a single determined man who kept his mouth shut, could do more against society than all the secret associations ever formed. Dupre smiled grimly when he noticed this. He was the only man sitting at a table. The police had had such difficulty in finding him. He knew that HertZog had never attended meetings. That was why the police were so hard-pressed to find him. The only man at the table was Dupre. The other men had all left the cafe in a hurry to get away from the police. The cafe was a favourite of Dupre's. He did not want to think they had deserted him in this crisis.. Dupre was in prison, and it was the treachery of M. Sonne that had sent him there. As he thought of this, Dupre cast a glance at the proprietor and gritted his teeth. ""Garcon,"" said Dupre quietly, ""bring me a caraffe of brandy"" The policeman at the back of the hall, feeling lonely perhaps, walked to the door and nodded to his parading comrade. The other paused for a moment on his beat, and they spoke to each other. ""Do you anticipate any trouble here?"" Dupre asked the officer confidently. ""Not in the least,"" answered the officer.. ""They had a meeting the other night--a secret meeting;"" the policeman smiled a little as he said this. ""They talked a good deal. They are going to do wonderful things. A man was detailed to carry out this job."" ""And have you arrested him?"" questioned Dupre. ""Oh dear, no. We watch him merely. He is the most frightened man in the city to-night"" ""I dare say; still it must have hurt M. Sonne's business aGood deal"" ""It has killed it for the present"" ""The Government will make it all right with him out of the secret fund"" ""He won't lose anything"" ""We expect him to come and tell us all about it"". ""You couldn't do better than arrange with M. Sonne. You could make a good bargain with him now, and you would be perfectly safe"" Dupre paid his bill and tipped the garcon liberally. ""I am glad that you mentioned it; I will speak to M.Sonne to-night, and see the rooms to-morrow"" ""Have another sip of brandy?"" ""No, thank you, I must be getting back to my place"" ""I will. Good-night."" ""Good-night,"" said Dupre, and left the bar. ""Good night,"" said the barman, and they both went home. ""What a night!"" said the bartender, ""what a night."" ""What?"" said the waiter, ""What's a night?"" ""A night of terror,"" said. Dupre kept his appointment, and the concierge showed him over the house. The back rooms were too dark, the windows being but a few feet from the opposite wall. Dupre said that he liked quiet, being a student. A front room on the third floor, however, pleased him, and he took it. He paid just a trifle more than requisite to that functionary, but not enough to arouse suspicion. Too much is as bad as too little, a fact that Dupre was well aware of. He had taken pains to see that his window was directly over the front door of the cafe, but now that he was alone and the door locked, he scrutinised the position more closely. He well knew the necessity of being on good terms with the Concierge, who would spy on him anyhow. He remembered that when the sun went down the awning was rolled up. Still, he remembered that the a. Dupre was a methodical man. He turned his student training on the case as if it were a problem in mathematics. The thing must be done so deftly that no suspicion could fall on the perpetrator. The more he thought of that plan the less he liked it. It was the sort of thing any fool could do, as the policeman had said. It would take some thinking over. Besides, dynamite dropped on the pavement would, at most, but blow in the front of the shop, kill the perambulating policeman perhaps, or some innocent passer-by. But it would not hurt old Sonne nor yet the garcon who had made himself so active in arresting Hertzog.. Dupre sat down at his table, thrust his hands in his pockets, stretched out his legs, knit his brows, and set himself to solve the conundrum. He could easily take a handbag filled with explosive material into the cafe. But he could not leave the bag there, and if he stayed with it his revenge would rebound on himself. Third, revenge was no revenge when it (A) killed the man who fired the mine, or (B) left a trail that would lead to his arrest. The waiter felt his unfortunate position. At the Vernon he had police protection, while if he went anywhere else he would have no more safeguard than any other citizen. So he stayed on at the Vernon, such a course being, he thought, the least of two evils. He now knew that he was a marked man, and so he now knew he had to leave the Cafe Vernon.. Dupre realised that there was another difficulty about the handbag scheme. The dynamite must be set off either by a fuse or by clockwork machinery. A fuse caused smoke, and the moment a man touched a bag containing clockwork his hand felt the thrill of moving machinery. Yes, Dupre reluctantly admitted to himself, the hand bag theory was not practical. It led to either self-destruction or prison. But he watched every incomer much more sharply than did the policeman. He was watching for the buzz of the rattlesnake's signal, like the shaking of dry peas in a pod, even though he knows nothing of snakes. How much more, therefore, would a suspicious waiter, whose nerves were all alert for the soft, deadly purr of dynamite mechanism, spoil everything the moment his hand touched the bag? Dupre had himself made several bombs.. Dupre bought a ball of cord, as nearly the colour of the front of the building as possible. He left his window open, and after midnight ran the cord out till he estimated that it about reached the top of the cafe door. He stole quietly down and let himself out, leaving the door unlatched. The door to the apartments was at the extreme edge of theBuilding, while the cafe doors were in the middle, with large windows on each side. If the Boulevard was not so wide, a person on the opposite side in a front room might fire a dynamite bomb across, as they do from dynamite guns. But then there was--""By God!"" cried Dupre, ""I have it!"" ""By God,"" said Dupre. ""I've got it!"". Dupre had forgotten the policeman was there night and day. He was so much a part of the pavement in Dupre's mind that he had actually forgotten the officer was there. By straining his eyes he noticed at the same moment that the cord dangled about a foot above the policeman's head, as he stood in the dark doorway. Dupre allowed himself the luxury of one silent gasp, then his heart took up its work again. ""I was looking for you,"" he said quietly. ""Oh, the chemist's at the corner is open all night"" ""I have a raging toothache and can't sleep, and I want to get something for it."". Dupre went to the corner shop and bought a bottle of toothache drops from the sleepy youth behind the counter. He roused him up however, and made him explain how the remedy was to be applied. Dupre thanked the policeman, closed the door, and went up to his room. He then wrote a short story about his experiences. The story was published in the first edition of the book, published in September 2013. The second edition has been published in October 2013. It is the first of a two-part series. The first part is published in English and the second in French. The book is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.. Dupre sat down and breathed hard for a few moments. A second later the cord was cut at the window and quietly pulled in. Another two feet and the string would have been down on his nose. I am certain he did not see it; I could hardly see it myself, looking for it. But I must think well over every phase of the subject before acting again. This is a lesson."" ""A mistake or two like that and you are doomed,"" he said to himself. ""That's what comes of thinking too much on one branch of your subject"" ""I am sure he didnot see it,"" he replied. ""I could hardlysee it myself"" ""The guarding of the side door was an inspiration"" ""This is a lessons"" ""A lesson"" ""You fool!"" he said. ""This was a lesson"". ""This has taught me a lesson"". The bomb-maker had to make his canister of explosive so sensitive to any shock that he realised if he tied the cord around it and flung it out into the night the can might go off when the string was jerked tight and the explosion take place in mid-air above the street. He arranged a spiral spring between can and cord to take up harmlessly the shock caused by the momentum of the package when thestring became suddenly taut. He saw that the weak part of his project was the fact that everything would depend on his own nerve and accuracy of aim at the critical moment. He would have but one chance, and there was no opportunity of practising. He had to render his canisters of explosive. so sensitive that he had torender his canster of explosiveso sensitive to. any shock. He realised that a slight miscalculation to the right or to the left would cause the bomb, when falling down and in, to miss the door altogether.. Dupre felt sure he was going to make some little mistake that would ruin all his plans. He resolved to do the best he could and accept the consequences with all the composure at his command. Dupre said to himself that if people allowed small technical difficulties to trouble them too much, nothing really worth doing would be accomplished in this world. ""There are four things I must do,"" he murmured: ""first, pull up the string; second, throw it in the fire; third, draw out the nail; fourth, close the window"" ""I think I have myself well in hand, yet I must not be too cool when I get downstairs,"" he said to yourself with a sigh. ""I must not have my heart beating faster than usual,"" he added. ""It is so many things to think of all at one time,"" he thought to himself. "". Dupre waited until the policeman had passed the door. He would take ten steps before he turned on his beat. When his back was towards the cafe door Dupre launched his bomb out into the night. He drew back instantly and watched the nail. It held when the jerk came. A moment later the whole building lurched like a drunken man, heaving its shoulders as it were. Dupre was startled by a great square of plaster coming down on his table with a crash. Below, there was a roar of muffled thunder. The floor trembled under him after the heave. The concussion had extinguished the street lamps opposite. All was dark in front of the cafe where a moment before the Boulevard was flooded with light. A cloud of smoke was rolling out from the lower part of the house.. Dupre went to the door and tried to open it, but it stuck so fast that he thought it was locked. He thought he heard groans, and found the concierge huddled in a corner. Dupre did the other three things quickly, and the explosion went off without a bang. He was able to get out of the building and get to safety. He is now recovering in a hospital in Paris. He has been given a new life and a new lease of life, but he is still haunted by the memory of the explosion. He says: ""I have certainly done some careless thing like that which will betray me yet; I wonder what it is?"". Dupre found a policeman on his hands and knees in the street. He helped him to his feet. Dupre expected to find a crowd, but there was no one there. He did not realise how short a time had elapsed since the disaster. He asked the policeman, ""How was it done?"" The policeman said, ""Oh, don't ask me"" The concierge said, 'I'm afraid of another explosion' The policeman replied, 'Nonsense! There's never a second. Come along."" They found some difficulty in getting outside. The lower hall was wrecked.. ""Is your comrade inside?"" asks Dupre. ""Yes; he and M. Sonne and two customers."" Dupre asks, ""And the garcon, wasn't he there?"" ""Oh, the gar Con, of course,"" says the policeman. ""Ah,"" said Dupre, in a satisfied voice, ""let us go in, and help them."" ""Dynamite! dynamite!"" they said, in awed voices among themselves.. M. Sonne was breathing when they found him, but died on the way to the hospital. The garcon had been blown to pieces. They arrested many persons, but never discovered who blew up the Cafe Vernon. It was surmised that some miscreant had left a bag containing an infernal machine with either the waiter or the proprietor. They found the policeman insensible under the debris, with a leg and both arms broken. Dupre helped to carry him out to the ambulance, and the Chief thanked Dupre for his assistance. They drove the crowd still further back."
0.4,0.5,36.69724770642202,"The Tub was a comfortable old boat, as everybody will testify who has ever taken a voyage in her. I know a very rich man who can well afford to take the best room in the best steamer if he wants to, but his preference always is for a slow boat like The Tub. The officers on a popular big and swift boat are prone to be a trifle snobbish. This is especially the case on the particular liner which for the moment stands at the top--the Tub.. Everybody on board The Tub knew that any vessel which started from New York the same day would reach Queenstown before us. If you get a word from the captain of such a boat you may consider yourself a peculiarly honoured individual, and even the purser is apt to answer you very shortly. On The Tub there was nothing of this. The officers were genial good fellows who admitted their boat was not the fastest on the Atlantic, although at one time she. The Tub was a broad slow boat, whose great speciality was freight. She rolled but little; and as the state-rooms were large and airy, every passenger on board The Tub was sure of a reasonably pleasant voyage. A fast and splendid liner of an opposition company left New York the next day. Many of our passengers explained to me they had come to New York with the intention of going by that boat, but they found all the rooms taken.. The Tub was well known that it was one of the cheapest boats crossing the ocean. It was a popular choice for the crew and passengers. The captain was a friend of mine, and I was delighted to be able to sit with him at the table. But the table was occupied by a sour and unattractive elderly woman. She was not the only one who was unhappy with the choice of the boat.. ""It's all right, gentlemen,"" said that charming man, before we could speak. ""I've arranged your places down the table on the opposite side. You don't need to say a word"" Down the long table from where she sat, in the next fifteen seats were fifteen young and pretty girls, most of them looking smilingly and expectantly toward the stairway down which we were descending. ""boys, there's a dragon in charge. I know her. She has crossed with. The lady wanted me to arrange it so that fifteen ladies should sit opposite her fifteen girls. But, of course, we couldn't do that, because there aren't fifteen other ladies on board. I have done the best I could, gentlemen, and, if you want the seats rearranged, I think we can manage it for you.. Students were principally students going over to German colleges on the cheap, some commercial travellers, and a crowd generally who could not afford to take a better boat.. The purser said that the dragon's name was Mrs. Scrivener-Yapling, with a hyphen. The hyphen was a very important part of the name. Any one who ignored that hyphen speedily fell from the good graces of the dragon. The dragon looked along the row, and said severely, ""Girls!"". The circular which Mrs. Scrivener-Yapling issued was shown to me once by one of the girls, and it represented that all travelling was first-class. The idea was that they learnt a great deal of geography, a good deal of French and German, and received in a general way a polish which Europe is supposed to give. I regret to say, however, in spite of the hyphen,. The girls had the advantage of motherly care during all the time they were abroad. The party was strictly limited in number, and the greatest care taken to select members only from the very best families in America. The girls walked two and two together, and kept their eyes pretty much on the planks beneath them. The fifteenth girl walked with the ""dragon,"" and thus the eight pairs paced slowly up and down the deck under the "" dragon's"" eye.. Stewart Montague, a commercial traveller from Milwaukee, said that he had crossed the ocean many times, but had never seen such a state of things before. He was going to take off his hat the next morning to the young lady who sat opposite him at the dinner-table and boldly ask her to walk the deck with him. If the ""dragon"" interfered, he proposed that we all mutiny, seize the vessel, put the captain in irons, imprison the "" dragon"" in the hold,. In a moment of temporary aberration I suggested that the ""dragon"" might not be, after all, such an objectionable person as she appeared, and that perhaps she could be won over by kindness. Instantly a motion was put, and carried unanimously, appointing me a committee to try the effect of kindness on the "" dragon"" It was further resolved that the meeting should be adjourned, and I should report progress at the next conclave. I respectfully declined this mission. I didn't wish to talk. ""I put my foot in it at the very first by pretending that I thought she came from New York, whereas she had really come from Boston. To take a New York person for a Bostonian is flattery, but to reverse the order of things, especially with a woman of the uncertain temper of Mrs. Scrivener-Yapling, was really a deadly insult. I fear this helped to shipwreck my mission, although I presume it would have been shipwrecked in any. Mr. Stewart Montague gave it as his opinion that the mission was hopeless from the first, and in this I quite agreed with him. He said he would try his plan at dinner, but what it was he refused to state. We asked if he would report on the success or failure, and he answered that we would all see whether it was a success or success for ourselves.. Stewart Montague asked a young lady, ""I understand you have never been over the ocean before?"" The young lady looked just a trifle frightened, blushed very prettily, and answered in a low voice that she bad not. Then she said, in an acid voice,. ""Will you oblige me by coming here for a moment?"" said the ""dragon"" to Miss Fleming. Miss Fleming slowly revolved in her circular chair, then rose and walked up to the head of the table. The rest of us said nothing, and appeared not to notice what had occurred.. The captain excused himself. There was something to attend to on deck, he said, and he left us. The ""dragon"" tried to resume conversation with the captain as if nothing had happened. Then, apparently unable to struggle any longer with her emotions, she rose gracefully, and, bowing to the captain, said, ""Exc. ""I expected that conversation would take place across the table all along the line, if I broke the ice"" The captain's chair beside his at meal-times had been empty since the voyage began. It was said that his wife took her meals in her state-room.. ""Gentlemen,"" began the man suavely, ""I would like to say a few words to you if I were certain that my remarks would be taken in the spirit in which they are given, and that you would not think me intrusive or impertinent"" ""Go ahead,"" said Montague gloom. ""Lord pity them,"" said somebody, who was sitting in the corner. The gentleman paid no attention to the remark. ""My name is Kensington,"" repeated the gentleman, ""and I have been asked by Mrs. Scrivener-Yapling to interfere, which I do very reluctantly"". ""Gentlemen,"" said Mr. Kensington, ""it is very painful for me to speak with you upon this subject. I only do so at the earnest request of the lady I have mentioned, because I am a family man myself, and I understand and sympathise with the lady in the responsibility which she has assumed"" ""Have a drink, Mr Kensington,"" said the man in the corner. ""I am sure I will not appeal in vain when I ask. ""Have a smoke, then?"" said Mr. Kensington. ""Thank you, I never drink,"" answered Mr. Montague. ""Impudent puppy,"" said Stewart Montague, as he closed the door behind him. ""I for one am going to give up the hunt,"" said the man in the corner.. Mr. Kensington or the ""dragon"" sprang up between some of the young men and some girls. The young lady would go with him, while the young gentleman was apt to use strong language and gnash his teeth. Many in the smoking-room no doubt would have liked to have picked a flaw in his character if they could. One even spoke of the old chestnut about a man who had no small vices. Stewart Montague was the most unpopular individual on board The Tub. The hatred that Montague felt for his wife was almost grotesque. Montague had somehow managed to get a contrite note of apology and distress to Miss Fleming. She fussed around like any other old hen who had in charge a brood of ducks. Once I thought there was going to be a row between Montague and Kensington.. Kensington turned deadly pale at this insult, and his fists clinched. He turned on his heel, and left Montague standing there. The old Tub worried her way across the ocean, and reached the bar at Liverpool just in time to be too late to cross it that night. Word was passed along that a tender would come out from Liverpool for us, which was not a very cheering prospect.. Kensington, with his closely-veiled wife hanging on his arm, was receiving the thanks and congratulations of the ""dragon"" The fifteen girls were all around her. Two policemen, accompanied by a woman, hurried up on board The Tub. We all looked at Kensington, and his face was greenish-pale.. ""How did I come here,"" she shrieked. ""In the name of God,"" he cried aghast, ""how did you come here?"" ""Oh, you. ""No wonder you are ashamed to show your face,"" she cried. ""I am afraid you will have to come with us, sir"" ""I thought perhaps you wouldn't like an account of this affair to go to the Boston newspapers,"" he said. ""Won't you allow me to carry this for you?"""
0.44,0.54,39.59304790165324,"Jean Rasteaux was a man of the Brittany coast, rugged and indented as it is. If he stood on the highest mountain peak, Jean might look over illimitable wastes of snow, but he could catch neither sound nor sight of the sea. The Alpine Corps was a wild body, harsh and brutal, and Jean Rastaux became a soldier in the Alpine Corps. He might have saved the fleet, but France, with the usual good sense of officialism, sent him into the mountains. Jean was stationed in a high valley that had but one outlet, a wild pass down which a river roared and foamed. The narrow path by the side of this stream was the only way out of or into the valley, for all around, the little plateau was walled in by immense peaks of everlasting snow. From the peaks to the south, Italy might have been seen, but no man had ever dared to climb any of them.. Jean was a good-natured giant, and he strove to do whatever was required of him. He was not quick at repartee, and the men mocked his Breton dialect. He became the butt for all their small and often mean jokes, and from the first he was very miserable. Added to his yearning for the sea, whose steady roar he heard in his dreams at night, he felt the utter lack of all human sympathy for him.. The average French soldier may be termed undersized when compared with the military of either England or Germany. There were several physically small men in the regiment, and one of these, like a diminutive gnat, was Samson's worst persecutor. One day the gnat ordered Samson to bring him a pail of water from the stream, and the big man unhesitatingly obeyed. He spilled some of it coming up the bank, and when he delivered it to the little man, the latter abused. ""You miserable, little insignificant rat,"" he cried. ""I could crush you, but you are not worth it"" The matter was reported to the officer, and Samson was placed under arrest. ""You're not worth my time,"" he said, ""and I'm not afraid of any of you, there!"". The officer struck the insubordinate soldier twice across the face, each time raising an angry red mark. When the inquiry was held the officer expressed his astonishment at the fact that Samson hit two men who had nothing to do with the insult he had received. The real culprit had been allowed to go unpunished. ""They deserved it,"" said Samson, sullenly, ""for what they had done before. I could not. The Breton was bound hand and foot to await the court-martial next day. The guard-house was a rude hut of logs situated on the banks of the roaring stream. A sentry marched up and down all night before the guard- house. The next morning, when Samson was sent for, the guard house was found to be empty. The huge Breton had broken his bonds as did Samson of old. He had pushed out a log of wood from the wall, and had squeezed himself through to the bank of the. Searchers found footprints in the snow, but could not trace the runaway. The trend of the footprints indicated that he had climbed on the rocks, and there, of course, it was impossible to trace him. The searchers were instructed to telegraph his description and his crime as soon as they reached a telegraph wire. ""Call out a detachment,"" he said, ""that is Samson on the mountain"". The officer who had been flung over Samson's head was now able to hobble about, and he was exceedingly bitter. Emissaries were sent after the searchers down the pass, calling them to return. ""He thinks to get to Italy,"" said the officer. ""I did not imagine the fool knew so much of geography"". The giant struggled on, and they could see by the glass that he sunk to the knee in the softening snow. From below it seemed as if the snow were as smooth as a sloping roof, but even to the naked eye a shadow crossed it near the top. That shadow was a tremendous ridge of overhanging snow more than a hundred feet deep; and Samson now paused as he realised that it was insurmountable. ""Now,"" said the officer, ""he is beginning to understand his situation."". The officer who was gazing through the glass at him dropped his hand to his side and laughed. ""The nature of the situation,"" he said, ""has at last dawned upon him. It took a long time to get an appreciation of it through his thick Breton skull"" ""Let me have the glass a moment,"" said another. ""He has made up his mind about something."" ""He was a thousand feet sheer down,"" said the officer.. Samson rolled down the slope towards the section of the regiment which lounged on the bank of the river. In place of the black figure there came downwards a white ball, gathering bulk at every bound. It came upon them simultaneously, and with it a wild panic of fear. The men and officers were hemmed in by the boiling torrent.. Samson was hours going up the mountain, but only seconds coming down. Like an overwhelming wave came the white crest of the avalanche. Some of them plunged in to get to the other side, but the moment the water laid hold of them their heels were whirled into the air, and they disappeared helplessly down the rapids. When the remainder of the regiment dug out from the debris the bodies of"

The result was bound to be either love or hate. Marriage at best is but a compromise, and if two people happen to be united who are of an uncompromising nature there is trouble. The mathematical chances are all against such a meeting. This is the reason that divorce courts exist.. John Bodman was a rich man who could afford to get rid of his wife. He hated her, and she hated him, but they were linked by a bond that only death could sever. The law recognises that the mind is a delicate instrument, and even the law recognised that it is easily thrown from its balance. If he had been a poor man he would probably have deserted her, but he was rich.. John Bodman's friends claim that his mind was unhinged. Neither his friends nor his enemies suspected the truth of the episode. Whether John Bodman was sane or insane at the time he made up his mind to murder his wife, will never be known. Nevertheless, cunning is often a quality in a mind that has gone wrong.. John Bodman knew the hotel well, and in happier days he had been intimately acquainted with the vicinity. He arose one morning at four o'clock, slipped unnoticed out of the hotel, and went to this point, which was locally named the Hanging Outlook. It was exactly the spot, he said to himself. The mountain which rose up behind it was wild.. John Bodman had planned his crime as grimly and relentlessly, and as coolly, as ever he had concocted a deal on the Stock Exchange. There was no thought in his mind of mercy for his unconscious victim. His hatred had carried him far. The next morning after breakfast, he said to his wife: ""I intend to take a walk in the mountains"". John Bodman had formed no fixed plan for his procedure when the place was reached. He resolved to be guided by circumstances. Do you wish to come with me?"" he asked her. ""Yes,"" she answered briefly. ""Very well, then,"" he said; ""I shall be ready at nine o'clock"" They left the hotel together, to which he was shortly to return alone.. The Bodman couple walked closely together to the Hanging Outlook. When they came within sight of it, Mrs. Bodman stopped and shuddered. ""John,"" she cried, with a gasp in her voice, calling him by his Christian name for the first time in years. ""Don't you think that if you had been. ""I was merely giving you a chance. Remember that,"" she told her husband. ""A man accepts nothing from one he hates,"" he replied. ""We are tied together, and you have done your best to make the bondage insupportable"" The woman dropped her alpenstock on the rock, and walked nervously to and. ""I will show you, John Bodman, how much I hate you,"" she said. ""Come here and sit down beside me, and be still"" ""I have told all my friends in England that I believed you intended to murder me in Switzerland,"" she told him. ""Good God!"" he cried. ""How could you say such a thing?"". The mad woman tore from the front of her dress shreds of lace and scattered them around. Bodman started up to his feet, crying, ""What are you about?"" But before he could move toward her she precipitated herself over the wall, and went shrieking."
0.64,0.74,54.00487713374601,"Old Mr. Saunders went home with bowed head and angry brow. He had not known that Dick was in the habit of coming in late. He himself went to bed early and slept soundly, as a man with a good conscience is entitled to do. But the boy's mother must have known the hours he kept, yet she had said nothing. This made the matter all the blacker. The father felt that mother and son were leagued against him. Now he would go to the root of things. The young man would speedily change his ways. There would be no half measures.. She had been a buffer between father and son since Dick was a child. The secret had long weighed upon her, and she felt it would come out at some hapless moment. ""He has a key,"" she said at last. The old man glared in speechless amazement. In his angriest mood he had never suspected anything so bad as this. ""I don't believe it is; I am sure Dick is a good boy, father."". ""Oh dear!"" cried the mother in anguish. ""Was it Mr. Hammond?"" ""I have never spoken to Hammond in my life,"" said the old man. ""No, I propose to stop this club business before it gets to the banker's ears that one of his clerks is a nightly attendant there"" ""You will not be harsh with him, father. Remember, he is a young man now, so please advise and do not threaten. Angry words can do no good."" ""I will do my duty,"" said his father, uncompromisingly. ""I'll be in shortly after he has had his supper."". Dick Saunders resented his boyhood of continual fear. He was troubled to find that the natural affection, which a son should have for his father, had vanished with it. The old man's severity had put him out of touch with his son. He had, on several occasions, made half-hearted attempts at a better understanding, but these attempts had unfortunately fallen on inopportune moments. There had been silence between the two for some time. Dick's mother, Mrs. Saunders, had had her share of trouble in this world, as every woman must who lives with a cantankerous man. She well knew the phrase about duty.. Richard Saunders' father was a man of many good qualities, but his temper was overshadowed by his temper. He often felt it would be a pleasure to go wrong, merely to refute his father's ideas regarding the way a child should be brought up. He would not have remained at home, had it not been for his mother's unwavering affection for him. She yearned to have him confide his trouble to her, yet she talked and talked of other things. She watched him narrowly as she talked, and saw with alarm that there was anxiety in his face. Perhaps after all she would not need to ask him to stay; he might remain of his own accord. He had a sort of admiration for the old man, whose good qualities were somewhat overshadowed by their temper.. ""Hush, Dick, you mustn't talk in that way. There is nothing much the matter, I hope? I want to speak with you about your club"" Dick looked sharply at his mother for a moment, then he said: ""Well, what does father want to know about the club? Does he wish to join?"" ""I didn't say your father----"" ""I can see right through you and away beyond,"" he said. ""Now, somebody has been talking to father about theClub, and he is on the war-path. ""He said it was a gambling club,"" Dick told his mother. ""I don't gamble, mother,"" he said. ""It takes money to gamble, and I'm not as rich as old Hammond yet."" ""Oh, Dick, Dick,"" said his mother, ""I'm sorry to hear that"" ""I know you'll believe me, though the old man won't. But it's true, nevertheless."" ""I can't afford it, mother, for it takes money for a gamble,"" he replied.. ""Mother, listen to me a moment. Mr. Julius Hammond proposed me for membership in the club -- my employer!"" Saunders said. ""I should never have thought of joining if it hadn't been for him"" ""Still if Mr. Hammond came to know that you spent your evenings at----"" ""I wouldn't tell it to any one else. Now, this is confidential and to yourself only"" ""The old terrifying relations between employer and employee do not exist now--at least, that is my experience."" ""I was amazed and told him I couldn't afford it"" ""You thought it was for merit, and father thought itwas luck. Well, it was. Dick smoothed his mother's grey hair and kissed her on the forehead. He said: ""Won't to-morrow night do as well, mother? I can't stay to-night. I have an appointment at the club."" Then he said: 'I'm going to raise your salary double the amount of entrance fee and annual. If you don't join I'll cut it down.' So I joined. I think I should have been a fool if I hadn't."" ""Dick, I never heard of such a thing! What in the world did. ""I know it is father who wants me to stay, not you. I presume he's on the duty tack. I think what he has to say will keep till to- morrow night"" ""If he must work off some of his sentiments on gambling, let him place his efforts where they are needed--let him tackle Jule Hammond, but not during business hours"" ""Hammond's a plunger from Plungerville, if you know what that means"" ""From nine to three he is the strictest and best business man in the city"". ""Where's Richard? Isn't he home yet?"" were the old man's first words. Mrs. Saunders smiled sadly as she heard it, remembering that Dick had said once that, even if he were safe within the gates of Paradise, the sound of his father's footsteps would make the chills run up his backbone. She had reproved the levity of the remark at the time, but she often thought of it, especially when she knew there was trouble ahead--as there usually was.. ""Did you tell him I wanted to speak with him?"" ""Yes, and he said he would stay home to-morrow night."" ""Did he know what I said to-night?"" ""I'm not sure that I told him you----"" ""Don't shuffle now. He either knew or he did not. Which is it?"" ""He knew, but he thought it might not be urgent"" ""Very well. I will wait half. Saunders sat grimly down with his hat still on, and crossed his hands over the knob of his stout walking-stick, watching the clock that ticked slowly against the wall. Under these distressing circumstances the old woman lost her presence of mind and did the very thing she should not have done. She should have agreed with him, but instead of that she opposed the plan and so made it inevitable. It would be a cruel thing, she said, to shame their son before his friends, to make him a laughing-stock among his acquaintances. Whatever was to be said could be said as well to-morrow night as to-night, and that in their own home, where. The old man darted one lowering look at her, and though she trembled, she welcomed the glance as indicating the success of her red herring. ""You were wrong--Mr. Hammond knows Dick is a member of the club,"" he said. ""And you believed it, of course!"" Saunders laughed in a sneering, cynical sort of way and resumed his scrutiny of the clock. The old woman gave up the fight and began to weep silently, hoping, but in vain, to hear the light step of her son approaching. The clock struck the hour; the old man rose without a word, drew his hat further over his brow, and left the house. Mrs. Saunders hardly believed her husband would carry out his threat. She called the serving-maid, who came, as it seemed to the anxious woman, with exasperating deliberation. ""Jane,"" she cried, ""do you know where the Athletic Club is? Do you knowwhere Centre Street is?"" ""It would be quicker to telegraph, ma'am,"" said Jane, who was not anxious to run anywhere.. ""Your father is coming to see you. Do make haste"" ""There is no need to sign it,"" said Mrs. Saunders. ""He will know his mother's writing,"" said her mistress. ""Electricity is more speedy than an old man's legs,"" said Mr. Saunders as he strode along the street. ""I will show both his wife and his son that he was not too old to be master in his own house"" ""I'll be back in a few minutes,"" said his wife. ""You can't be late for a meeting,"" he said.. Mr. Saunders was somewhat abashed to find the club building a much more imposing edifice than he had expected. He talked angrily to himself as he went along, and was wroth to find his anger lessening as he neared his destination. Anger must be very just to hold its own during a brisk walk in evening air that is cool and sweet. Mr. Saunders walked to the True Blue Athletic Club. It was brilliantly lit from basement to attic. A group of men, with hands in pockets, stood. The possibility of not getting in had never occurred to the old gentleman, and the thought that his son, safe within the sacred precincts of a club, might defy him, flogged his flagging anger. ""I'll try, at least,"" he said, going up the stone steps. ""Well, I'm blest!"" said the man on the kerb; ""I wonder how. The old man asked to see his son, Richard Saunders. The porter opened the door and led him to a sumptuous parlour. The old man wondered at the cordiality of his reception. He was led into a most sumptious parlours. The room was lit by a cluster of electric lamps in the ceiling. He asked if that were the club and was told that it was. He said: ""I wish I had asked him."" He was then shown to his son's room.. ""But--stop a moment. I don't want to see Mr. Hammond. I have nothing to do with him. I want tosee my son"" ""Yes, sir. He told me to bring you in here when you came and to let him know at once."" ""Yes. He did."" ""But -- but--but--but I want my son."" ""I don't know what you want with my son. I just want to talk to him"" ""I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you."". The cup was an elaborate specimen of the silversmith's art. It was referred to as the ""Cup"" Some one had hung a placard on it, bearing, in crudely scrawled letters, the words: ""Fare thee well, and if for ever Still for ever Fare thee well"" The old man did not know that this elaborate specimen was referred as the 'Cup' The old gentleman was wondering what all this meant when he was met by a banker. He felt resentment at what he considered his foppish appearance, realising almost at the same moment the rustiness of his own clothes.. ""I am,"" said the old man firmly. ""That's why I'm here"" ""I want to know the truth,"" said his son. ""The truth is about as gloomy as it can be,"" said father. ""No man is more sorry than I am"" ""There is not one chance in ten thousand of his recovering his lost ground,"" said dad. ""I have no hope for him"" ""Yes. Of course you are very anxious about your boy."" ""Yes,"" said son. 'So are we all, and I presume I'm the most anxious man of the lot. The banker had allowed his old habit of domineering to get the better of him, and now in searching after a phantom he had suddenly come upon a ghastly reality. He took off the placard, tore it up, and threw it into the waste basket. ""There's no use in giving up before you're thrashed,"" said the old man. ""Bless you, no. Nor smoke either. No, nor gamble, which is more extraordinary"" ""Does Richard drink?"" asked the oldMan huskily, remembering the eulogy. ""Is it true that you induced my son to join this club?"" asked the old man. ""Certainly. I heard what he could do from a man I had confidence in, and I said to myself, We must have young Saunders for a member"" ""Then don't you think you are largely to blame?"" ""Oh, if you like to put it that way; yes. Still I'm the chief loser"" ""You'll find that it reaches the spot,"" said the oldman. ""I imagine it's a love affair"". The banker led the way on tiptoe between the curtains into a large room filled with silent men. Temporary seats had been built around the walls, tier above tier, and every place was taken. Saunders noticed his son standing near the table in his shirt- sleeves, with his cue butt downward on the ground. His face was pale and his lips compressed as he watched his opponent's play like a man fascinated by a game. The banker said: ""Of course you will be anxious to see how the thing ends, but be careful the boy doesn't catch sight of you. It might r. Old Saunders only faintly understood the situation, but his whole sympathy went out to his boy. Evidently his back was against the wall, and he was fighting a hopeless fight, but was grit to the last. He felt an instinctive hatred of the confident opponent who was knocking the balls about with a reckless accuracy which was evidently bringing dismay to the hearts of at least half the onlookers. ""By Jove!"" cried the banker, ""he's missed. Didn't put enough stick behind it. That comes of being too blamed sure. Shouldn't wonder but there is going to. ""What is it all about? Is this an important match?"" he asked. ""Important! You bet it is. Why, Jule Hammond alone has ten thousand on Saunders."" ""Yes,"" continued the other, ""it's the great match for the cup. Prognor has won one, and Saunders one; now this game settles it"" ""I doubt if there's another amateur like him in this country,"" said the other. ""He's a man to be proud of, although he seemed to go to pieces to-night"" ""Yes. He did,"" replied the old man, ""although he seemed like he was. Young Saunders played very carefully, taking no risks, and his father watched him with absorbed, breathless interest. The father marvelled at the almost magical command the player had over the ivory spheres. They came and went, rebounded and struck, seemingly because he willed this result or that. The boy never looked up from the green cloth and the balls. He stepped around the table to his different positions without hurry, and yet without undue tardiness. All eyes were fastened on his play, and there was not a sound in the large room but the ever-recurring click-click of the balls, and the sound of the ball. The old man was amazed that the combination of all these delicate niceties were concentrated in one person, and that person his own son. There was a dexterity of touch, and accurate measurement of force, a correct estimate of angles, a truth of the eye, and a muscular control that left the old man amazed. The old man stood up with the rest, and his natural combativeness urged him to take part in the fray and call for fair play. The umpire rose and demanded order. When the tumult had subsided, he sat down. The young man, playing very deftly, appeared to be able to keep them in that position as if he might go on scoring indefinitely.. Saunders deliberately struck the balls with his cue ball and scattered them far and wide. Some of the High Fliers, however, cried, ""Decision! Decision!"" The umpire severely told Saunders to go on with his play. ""That is magnificent, but it is not war,"" said the man beside old Saunders. ""He has no right to throw away a single chance when he is so far behind."" ""Go on with your play, Mr. Saunders,"" the umpire said.. The old man was too much excited to speak, but he hoped the boy would take no more chances. The silence became intense, almost painful. Every man leaned forward and scarcely breathed. Suddenly a great cheer broke out, and young Saunders rested as before without taking his eyes from the cloth. ""I'm willing to lose my ten thousand now without a murmur. You see, you are a mascot after all."" Prognor strode down to the billiard-table and stretched his hand across it. The father was pleased to see that Dick played now with all the care and caution he had observed at first.. Saunders took the outstretched hand of his defeated opponent, and the building rang again. A cheer shook the ceiling. The cup would remain on its black marble pedestal. Saunders had won. The old man was your mascot. Your luck changed the moment he came in. Your father had his eye on you all the time. I'm off now; I want to tell your mother about it. Dick. He caught his father's eye, although the old man's glance was kindly enough."
0.75,0.85,60.95179987797438,"Albert Prior was sentenced to be hanged by the neck until he was dead. Public opinion had been triumphantly vindicated. Everybody agreed that it was a righteous verdict, but now that he was sentenced they added, ""Poor fellow!"" The insanity plea had broken down, and Albert Prior had been found guilty of murder. The verdict was overturned, and he was hanged by his own neck. The trial took place in the city of New York, and the verdict was upheld. The jury found Prior guilty of first-degree murder, and sentenced him to death by hanging. The sentence was later reduced to life in prison, and his life was spared. The victim was a young woman, who had become engaged to a man who was a telegraph operator. She was the first person to oppose Prior's violent will..  Bowen was captured by a mob and sent back to the county town where he lived. He was taken back to his home and lodged in gaol. The mob was the more dangerous on that account. One man in its midst thrust his closed hand towards the sky, and from his fist dangled a rope. The public opinion, ever right and all-powerful, now asserted itself. The day man, with a smile, not knowing what he did, said Bowen would likely be found at the Parker Place, where Miss Johnson lived with her aunt, her parents being dead. He fired four times at her, keeping the other two bullets for himself. But he was a coward and a cur at heart, and when it came to the point of putting the two bullets in himself he quailed, and thought it best to escape.. The sheriff knew his duty, but he hesitated to perform it. Technically, this was a mob--a mob of outlaws. But in reality it was composed of his fellow-townsmen, his neighbours, his friends. So the sheriff wrung his hands, bewailed the fact that such a crisis should have arisen during his term of office, and did nothing. The clamours of the mob grew so loud that the trembling prisoner in his cell heard it, and broke out into a cold sweat when he quickly realised what it meant. The sheriff's decision to let the prisoner go was the right one, and it saved the life of a wretch who rightly merited any doom the future might have in store for him.. The sheriff was despairing. He was to have a dose of justice in the raw. ""What shall I do?"" asked the gaoler. ""Give up the keys?"" ""That is the law,"" answered the sheriff. ""Oh, I'd give 'em the keys, and let 'em hang him,"" said the gaoli. ""It'll save you the trouble"" ""I don't know what to do,"" cried the sheriff, despairingly. ""Would there be any use in speaking to them, do you think?"". ""Gentlemen,"" he cried--and his clear voice reached the outskirts of the crowd--""don't put an everlasting stain on the fair name of our town. No one has ever been lynched in this county and none in this State, so far as I know. Don't let us begin it"" The keys were not given up. The clamour had ceased. A young man with pale face and red eyes stood on the top of the stone wall that surrounded the gaol. He held up his hand and there was instant silence. They all recognised him as Bowen, the night operator, to whom she had been engaged.. ""Don't think it's mercy I'm preaching; it's vengeance!"" Bowen shook his clenched fist at the gaol. ""That wretch there has been in hell ever since he heard your shouts"" ""I want that murderer to die by the slow merciless cruelty of the law"" ""He'll be in hell, for he's a dastard, until the time his trembling legs carry him to the scaffold"" ""His money can't buy him off. He will be hanged by the law. Lynching is over in a moment."" ""I'd be the man to lead you to batter down those doors and hang him on the nearest tree"" ""You know it."" ""But he won't escape. His money can't buy himoff"". The man with the rope threw it over into the gaol-yard, shouting to the sheriff, ""Take care of it, old man, you'll need it."" The sheriff, overtaking Bowen, brought his hand down affectionately on his shoulder. ""Bowen, my boy,"" he said, ""you're a brick. I'm everlastingly obliged to you"" ""Thanks,"" said Bowen, shortly. He was not in a mood for congratulations. ""If you ever get into a tight place, Bowen, come to me, and if money or influence will help you, you can have all I've got of either"" ""Bowens"" was sentenced to be hanged on September 21, at 6 A.M.. People quoted the phrase about the worst use a man can be put to. People sent flowers to the condemned man's cell. Women begged for signatures, and got them. Every man and woman signed them. All except one. Even he was urged to sign by a tearful lady, who asked him to remember that vengeance was the Lord's. ""I swear to you, madam, that if you succeed in getting that murderer reprieved, I will be the instrument of the Lord’s vengeance,"" said Bowen. ""Oh, don't say that,"" pleaded the lady. ""You were noble once and saved him from lynching; be noble again and save him from the gallows."". ""If you reprieve him you will make a murderer of me, for I will kill him when he comes out, if it is twenty years from now"" ""The next murder that is committed will be followed by a lynching just because you are successful to-day"" ""It is, if you will pardon me, an insult to ask me. It is such work as you are doing that makes lynching possible"" ""You talk of lynching; it is such Work as you Are doing that Makes Lynching Possible"" ""I will kill you when he is dead, if he is alive"" ""If you are alive, you have many to help; the one in the grave has few to cry for justice."" ""The person who is alive has many to Help. The person in the Grave has Few to Cry for Justice"". The governor made no sign. Sometimes it was rumoured that the governor was going to commute the sentence to imprisonment for life; then the rumour was contradicted. The sheriff had never yet hanged a man, and did not wish to begin. After nine o'clock messages almost ceased coming in, and Bowen sat reading the evening paper. The governor has made up his mind at last that the law must take its course. He is now waiting for the verdict to be returned to him. The trial is expected to last until the end of the month, when the judge will decide whether to sentence the man to death or to life in prison. The jury will be sequestered until the verdict is returned.. Bowen was in no doubt as to what he would do, but he wanted to think over it. The telegraph instrument called to him and he turned to it, giving the answering click. He was alone, except for the messenger boy who sat dozing in a corner, with his cap over his eyes. He took up the telegram again, and read it with set teeth. ""Do not proceed further with execution of Prior. Sentence commuted. Documents sent off by to-night's mail registered"" He wrote it down mechanically from the clicking instrument, but when he read it, he jumped to his feet.. Message was to himself from the operator at the capital, and it told him he was to forward the sheriff's telegram without delay. Bowen answered that the telegram to the sheriff would be immediately sent. It is a pity it cannot be written that Bowen felt some compunction at what he was doing. We like to think that, when a man deliberately commits a crime, he should hesitate and pay enough deference to the proprieties as to feel at least a temporary regret. Bowen's thoughts were upon the dead girl, not on the living man. He roused the dozing telegraph messenger. ""Here,"" he said, ""take this to the gaol and find the sheriff"". The boy said ""Yes, sir,"" and departed into the night. He returned so quickly that Bowen knew without asking that he had found the sleepless sheriff at the gaol. The message to the governor, written in a trembling hand by the sheriff, was: ""I understand that the execution is to take place. If you should change your mind, for God's sake telegraph as soon as possible"" Bowen did not send that message, but another. He laughed--and then checked himself in alarm, for his laugh sounded strange. ""I wonder if I am quite sane,"" he said to himself. 'I doubt it."" ""I doubt that I am sane,"" said Bowen. ''. The day operator will be here at six, I will return as soon as I have had a cup of coffee, and we'll handle all you can write,"" answered Bowen. ""I shall have a lot of stuff to send over and I want it rushed. Some of the papers may get out specials. I would have brought an operator with me but we thought there was going to be a reprieve--although the sheriff didn't seem to think so,"" he added. ""Thanks,"" said Bowen. 'Thanks' was the reply. 'I'm glad you're all right,' said the sheriff.. ""I thought the governor would cave; didn't you?"" said Bowen. ""He's a shrewd old villain. He'd have lost next election if he'd reprieved this man"" ""A weak-kneed governor is Judge Lynch's friend. Well, good-night, see you in the morning"" ""Good-night,"" said Bowen, ""and good-bye"" ""I'll be in touch with you in a few moments,"" said the telegraph man. ""There will be a newspaper man here with a good deal of copy. ""I have come to give myself up,"" said Bowen, before the official could greet him. ""For murder, I suppose,"" replied the sheriff. ""This is no time for joking, young man,"" said the sheriff, severely. ""Rush it off as fast as you can and I'll be back to help before you are tired"" ""Do I look like a humourist? Read that,"" Bowen said to the sheriff as he read the dispatch. ""I'm not joking,"" replied his friend. ""It's not a joke."". The sheriff had never hanged a man before. He staggered back against the wall, putting up his arm to keep himself from falling. He turned his face on his arm against the walls and wept. The sheriff turned indignantly to him, trying to hide the feeling of shame he felt at giving way, in anger at the witness of it. ""And you come to me, you villain, because I said I would help you if you ever got into a tight place?"" cried the young man, ""I come to you to give myself up"" ""Yes,"" said the sheriff.. ""I'll leave by the first train,"" he said. ""I don't suppose you'll try to escape."" For the first time within human recollection the newspapers were unanimous in commending the conduct of the head of the State. The organs of the governor's own party lavishly praising him. The opposition sheets grudgingly admitted that he had more backbone than they had given him credit for. The sheriff left for the capital, and the sheriff left by theFirst train for the Capital. The governor's son, who had been in prison, was released and returned home.. ""In the name of all that's wonderful, sheriff,"" said the bewildered governor, ""who signed all those petitions? If the papers wanted the man hanged, why, in the fiend's name, did they not say so before, and save me all this worry? Now how many know of this suppressed dispatch?"" ""Well, there's you and your subordinates here and----"" ""We'll say nothing about it."" ""I'll burn all the documents."" ""It's not on record in the books, and I'll burnall the documents"" ""I'm re-elected"""
0.48,0.58,42.64232008592911,"Only the last four words of the above poem are claimed as original. ""Then America declared war on England."" ""As much as at a theatre?"" ""Yes, dear"" ""Yes."". ""They are the orphans of sailors, dear."" ""No, dear; the money goes to the poor orphans, I think"" ""You pay just what you can afford."" ""I am sure I do not know, dear"" ""By the way, Mr. Mr.. ""Do they give any of the money to American orphans?"" ""I believe not, madam. Subscriptions at concerts given on board British steamers are of course donated entirely to the Seamen's Hospital or Orphanage of Liverpool"" ""I should think that ten Americans cross on these lines for every one Englishman"" ""Yes,. Mrs. Pengo was asked if she felt better by two young ladies. She said she didn't think she would feel any better as long as the ship rolled. The ladies asked if the money went to charity. Mrs Pengo replied that it did, and that it went to an American charity. She then suggested a division of the proceeds of the concerts.. ""Well, isn't that all right?"" said the captain. ""Yes, it is perfectly fair. It goes to the Liverpool Seamen's Hospital."" ""Well, as long as such large sums are subscribed by Americans, that the money should not be divided and part of it at least given to an American charity"" ""Why, that seems perfectly fair, doesn't it, Mr. Daveling?"" replied the other girl.. The captain of the steamer was so impressed with his own importance that he did not have any tact. Two young American girls were enthusiastic, and they spoke to several of the passengers about it, both American and English. The English passengers all recognised the justice of the proposed plan, so a committee of five young ladies, and one young gentleman as spokesman, waited upon the captain. The doctor of the ship was alarmed, and stroked his moustache thoughtfully.. ""In England we think a great deal of precedent,"" said the doctor. ""We do a thing in one way for a number of years, and then keep on doing it because we have always done it in that way"" The doctor demurred at going to see the captain in relation to the matter. He said it wouldn't be the thing, as he was an official, and that it would be better to get one of the passengers. ""A captain of an ocean liner, as I have endeavoured to show, is a very great. The captain told the committee that the money from the concerts had always gone to the Liverpool Seamen's Hospital, and always would while he was commanding a ship. The ship was almost immediately divided into two camps. ""Those who are not with us,"" said the young women, ""are against us."" Then it was that every passenger had to declare himself. The captain's dictum had settled the matter. The money had to be divided between those who had expressed themselves as favouring the dividing of the money, and those who did not.. The American Seamen's Orphans' Home was to be set up in Liverpool. But when the money was raised, it was refused by the British government. The decision was made to hold a second concert to raise money for the cause. The second concert was held on the same day as the first. The money was given to the American Seaman's Orphan's Home. The third concert was to take place on the day after the second concert. It was to raise funds for a new hospital for the orphans.. Rumour had it at first that the captain refused to see the delegation of gentlemen who had requested audience with him. This rumour, however, turned out to be incorrect. A committee was appointed to wait upon the captain next day. It was not safe for an American to be seen conversing with an Englishman, or vice versa. The captain received the delegation in his room with one or two of the officers standing beside him. He said: ""I have received you in my room because. ""It seems to us,"" said the spokesman, ""that it is a very unjust thing to allow one class of passengers to hold a concert, and to refuse permission to another class to do the same thing"" ""If that is all you complain of"" said the captain very suavely, ""of what injustice you complain?"" ""We will appeal against your decision to the owners of this steamship, and that, unless an apology is tendered, we will never. The captain of the ship said he had banned the American concert. He also banned the English concert. The American delegates looked rather blankly at each other, and then the spokesman smiled. ""Oh, well,"" he said, ""if you have prohibited both of them,"
0.6,0.7,48.45381937333607,"The road by the margin of the river was in places bad, but the august horseman made good progress along it. The iron hand of the Archbishop had come down on every truculent noble in the land, and every castle gate that had not opened to him through fear, had been battered in by force. Peace now spread her white wings over all the country, and where opposition to his Lordship's stubborn will had been the strongest, there was silence as well, with, perhaps, a thin wreath of blue smoke hovering over the blackened walls. The grim and silent horseman was the brains, where the troops were the limbs.. The provinces on each bank of the Moselle from Treves to the Rhine now acknowledged Baldwin as their over-lord.. The Archbishop of Canterbury was on his way to his summer palace at Cochem. The palace was a fortress almost impregnable, and three hundred years later it sent into a less turbulent sphere the souls of one thousand six hundred Frenchmen before its flag was lowered to the enemy. The Archbishop's attire was neither clerical nor warlike, but rather that of a nobleman riding abroad where no enemy could possibly lurk. The personal appearance of the Archbishop and the smallness of his escort were practical illustrations of the fact that the land was at peace, and that he was master of it.. The Archbishop was to all appearance unarmed, and had no protection save a light chain mail jacket of bright steel, which was worn over his vesture, and not concealed as was the custom. This jacket sparkled in the sun as if it were woven of fine threads strung with small and innumerable diamonds. It might ward off a dagger thrust, or turn aside a half-spent arrow, but it was too light to be of much service against sword or pike. The escort consisted of twelve men, all lightly armed, for Gott. ""Who is there left to molest me?"" asked the Archbishop. ""To what district have we penetrated?"" said the general. The answer was that there had been no one left tomolest him. The general was forced to admit that there was none left to Molest him, and that he should ride alone. The Archbishop then decided to ride with an escort of a thousand men, but with no one to stop him. He rode down the valley with the escort, but no one was with him. After he reached the top of the hill, the general was able to see the village. ""The Countess of Starkenburg must surely now be at an age when the thoughts turn toward Heaven rather than toward matrimony,"" said the monk. ""I intend to marry her to one of my victorious knights, who will hold the castle for me,"" replied the Archbishop. ""The castle, I am told, has well-filled wine vaults, and old age in wine is doubtless more to thy taste than the. ""The fault is not beyond the power of our Holy Father to remedy by special dispensation,"" replied the monk. ""I give her the choice merely because I am loth to war with a woman,"" said the Elector. ""The widow may give it up peaceably at the altar, or forcibly at the point of the sword, whichever method most commends itself to her ladyship"" ""The castle must be in the command of one whom I can trust,"" said his son.. The Archbishop and his guard were trotting rapidly round a promontory and following a bend of the river. Suddenly, they came upon a troop of armed and mounted men, standing like statues before them. The black horse, old in campaigns, recognised danger ahead, and stopped instantly, without waiting for the drawing of the rein. The troop numbered an even score, and completely filled the way between the precipice on their left and the stream on their right. Although armed, every sword was in its scabbard,. ""My Lord Archbishop of Treves, the Countess Laurette von Starkenburg invites you to sup with her"" ""The Countess is most kind,"" he said, slowly, as if spoken again by some one concealed in the further forest. A deep frown darkened the brow of the fighting archbishop. ""I am not a man of the world, but of the earth,"" the archbishop said.. The leader of the opposing host suddenly lowered his upraised sword, as if in salute, but the motion seemed to be a preconcerted signal. ""Convey to her my respectful admiration, and express my deep regret that I am unable to accept her hospitality, as I ride to-night to my Castle at Cochem,"" he said. The captain of the guard had seen from the first that attack or defence was equally useless, and, with his men, had also given way gradually as the strange colloquy went on.. Baldwin the Fighter, whose compressed lips showed how loth he was to turn his back upon any foe, nevertheless saw the futility of resistance. He said, hastily, ""Back! Back! If we cannot fight them, we can at least out-race them."" The good monk had taken advantage of his privilege as a non-combatant to retreat well to the rear while the invitation was being given and declined, and in the succeeding flight found himself leading the van. The captain of the guard threw himself between the Starkenburg men and the prince of the Church, but the former made no effort at pursuit.. The Emperor was forced to retreat by a band of men. The leader of the band was the Countess Laurette von Starkenburg. The Countess invited the Emperor to sup with her. The Emperor was stunned and quailed. He could not believe his eyes. He had been trapped. He was now going to be killed. The Elector was not so lucky. He fled. The archbishop followed him. The emperor was now trapped, too. The countess was his vassal. The Archbishop was now the Elector's master.. ""A servant,"" said the man, slowly, ""obeys the one directly above him, and leaves that one to account to any superior authority"" ""I command you to let us pass unmolested on our way; refuse at your peril"" ""The orders stand, my Lord."" ""You will, I trust, allow this mendicant monk to pass peaceably on his way to Treves"". The cortege reformed and trotted gently down the road until it came to a by-way leading up the hill. The leaders turned, reducing their trot to a walk because of the steepness of the ascent. His Lordship rode at first in sullen silence, then with a quick glance of his eye he summoned the captain to his side. ""We will do ourselves the honour of waiting upon this most bountiful hostess,"" he said. ""My lady would hold me to blame were she prevented from offering her hospitality to the mendicant."". ""There will be some confusion at the gate,"" he said, in a low voice. ""Escape then if you can. Ride for Treves as you never rode before"" He slipped the ring of office from his finger and passed it unperceived into the officer's hand. ""I will succeed or die, my Lord,"" said the Archbishop. ""Succeed and live,"" said Treves. ""A knighthood and the command of a thousand men awaits you."" ""Satisfied?"" said the officer. ""Yes,"" replied Treves, ""I am."". The Archbishop rode into the courtyard of the convent. He did not dismount, but stood with his head bowed. A woman in a white headdress stood in front of him. She was the Archbishop's wife, and he was her husband. He was not about to dismount. He had to wait for her to get off her horse. She did not move. He waited. She waited for him. He didn't move. She stood there. He stayed there. She stayed there until he left. He walked away. She followed him. The Archbishop left.. The lady came slowly down the broad stone steps, followed by her feminine train. She placed her white hand upon his stirrup, in mute acknowledgment of her vassalage. ""It is a hundred years since my poor house has sheltered so august a guest,"" she said. ""If I remember rightly, madame, my august predecessor slept well beneath this roof."" ""Alas, yes!"" murmured the lady, sadly. ""We have ever accounted it the greatest misfortune of our line, that he should have died mysteriously here. ""Not so mysteriously, madame, but that there were some shrewd guesses concerning his malady"" ""It was supposed that in his camp upon the lowlands by the river he contracted a fever from which he died"" ""I most devoutly echo that trust, my Lord, and pray that God, who watches over us all, may guard your health while sojourning here"". The Archbishop was led to the Rittersaal by his wife. She begged him to dismount, saying he needed rest and refreshment. The gates were now fast closed, and forty horses were ranged with their tails to the wall, the silent riders in their saddles. The only living thing among them that showed no sign of dismay was the Archbishop's guard.. The Archbishop entered the gloomy castle with a sense of defeat tugging down his heart to a lower level than he had ever known it to reach before. Between two of the hostile horsemen stood his captain, with doublet torn and headgear awry, evidently a discomfited prisoner. The Countess conducted her guest through the lofty Knight's Hall, in which his Lordship saw preparations for a banquet going forward. An arched passage led them to a small room that seemed to be within a turret hanging over a precipice, as if it were an eagle's nest.. The Archbishop of Cologne was invited to a dinner by the Countess von Starkenburg. He was suspicious of the countess, and asked her why she was imprisoned in her castle. The countess told him that she was being held prisoner by her husband. The Archbishop then asked her to give him a cup of wine, which she did. He then asked why she had imprisoned him in her home. The Countess replied that she had been holding him prisoner for some time. He replied that he had been held prisoner for his own safety. The pair then had a drink of wine.. ""How poorly are we served by our underlings, if such a thought has been conveyed to your lordship's mind"" ""I asked them to invite you hither with such deference as a vassal should hold toward an over-lord. I am grievously distressed to learn that my commands have been so ill obeyed"" ""Your commands were faithfully followed, madame, and I have made no complaint regarding lack of deference"" ""When two-score armed men carry a respectful invitation to one having a bare dozen. ""I have a favour to beg of you. I wish to ask permission to build a castle on the heights above Trarbach, for my son."" ""The Count Johann, third of the name?"" ""The same, my Lord, who is honoured by your Lordship's remembrance of him."" ""And you wish to place this stronghold between your castle of Starkenburg and my town of Treves?"" ""Were I a suspicious man, I might imagine you had. ""I have ever been accustomed to look to my own defence,"" said the Archbishop, drily; adding, as if it were an afterthought, ""with the blessing of God upon my poor efforts"" The Count Johann will hold the castle in your defence, he said. ""A strong house is never built with a weak purse,"" he added. ""I fear I trespass on your Lordship's patience but this is now the end"" ""I will not be molested during the building,"" replied the Countess.. The Archbishop arose with a scowl on his face, and paced the narrow limits of the room like a caged lion. The hot anger mounted to his brow and reddened it, but he strode up and down until he regained control of himself. He spoke with a touch of hardness in his voice: ""A good fighter, madame, holds his strongest reserves to the last"" The lady, now standing, answered nothing to this taunt, but the colour flushed her pale cheeks. ""I am, then, a prisoner, and you hold me for ransom, but it. The Elector paced up and down for a time, muttering to himself, then smote his open palm against a pillar of the balcony. Suddenly he turned and looked at the Countess, meeting her clear, fearless grey eyes, noticing, for the first time, the resolute contour of her finely-moulded chin. ""Madame,"" he said, with admiration in his tone, ""you are a brave woman."" ""I am not so brave as you think me, my Lord,"" she answered, cold. ""I am not brave enough to allow your Lordship to go free, if you refuse what I ask."" ""Not so, my Lord"". ""Widow, there is truth in what you say, even if a woman hath spoken it,"" replied the Archbishop, with a grim smile on his lips and undisguised admiration gleaming from his dark eye. ""You will be treated with that consideration which should be shown to one of your exalted station."" ""I beg of you an annual tribute, so they might be certain your Lordship were well housed in this castle"" ""In God's name, hold him, widow, till we get our own again!"" replied the widow.. ""What of the arch when the keystone is withdrawn? What of the sheep when the shepherd disappears? My Lord, you do yourself and your great military gifts a wrong"" ""I well knew that, did but a whisper of my humble invitation and your gracious acceptance of the same reach Treves, it might be misconstrued"" ""What of my stout army lying at Treves?"" ""There is one point you have not reckoned upon: What of my Stout Army?"". The Archbishop took her unresisting hand, and, bending, raised it to his lips with that dignified courtesy which, despite his disclaimer, he knew well how, upon occasion, to display. ""Madame,"" he said, ""I ask you to believe that your request was granted even before you marshalled such unanswerable arguments to stand, like armoured men, around it. There is a tern and stringent law of our great Church which forbids its servants suing for a lady's hand. Countess, I never felt"
0.49,0.59,42.71457085828344,"Poker cannot be played without the putting up of a good deal of the coin of the realm, says the author. The seductive game of poker is one that I do not understand. I content myself with eucre and other games which do not require the wagering of money. The society for the reformation of poker players, or to speak more correctly, for the. reformation. of one particular poker player, was formed one bright starlight night, latitude such a number, and longitude something else.. A seat at a small table compares with a seat at the large table. You have some individuality at the short table; you are merely one of a crowd at the long table. Our small table was not quite full. I had the honour of sitting at the head of it, and on each side of me were two young fellows, making five altogether. We all rather prided ourselves on the fact that there were no ladies at our little table. The young Englishman who sat at my right hand at the corner of the table was going out to America to learn farming.. Henry Storm was his name, and a milder mannered man with a more unsuitable name could hardly be found. The first two or three days out he was the life of our party. We all liked him, in fact, nobody could help liking him. But, as the voyage progressed, he grew more and more melancholy, and, what was really serious, took little food, which is not natural in an Englishman. He would find that out soon enough when he got to America.. ""Do you know,"" he began, ""that Henry Storm is being robbed?"" ""Being robbed?"" I answered; ""you mean he has been robbed."" ""Well, has been, and is being, too. The thing is going on yet"" ""He is playing altogether too much poker in the smoking-room, and has lost a pile of money"" ""Oh, it's easy to say that; but he's in the hands of a swindler, of a professional gambler"". ""That man,"" continued Smith, as he passed us, ""was practically under arrest for gambling on the steamer in which I came over. It seems that he is a regular professional gambler, who does nothing but go across the ocean and back again, fleecing young fellows like Storm"" ""Does he cheat?"" I asked. ""He doesn't need to. He plays poker. An old hand, and a cool one, has no occasion to cheat at that game to get a young one's money away from him."". ""I do believe young Storm has lost nearly all his money to that fellow"" ""Can't he be made to disgorge?"" ""I think we should call a meeting of our table, somewhere out here in the quiet, and have a talk over it, and make up our mind what is to be done"" ""It isn't as if he had been caught cheating--he hasn't, and won't be. He doesn't cheat--he doesn't need to, as I said before"". The result of this conversation was the inauguration of the Society for the Reforming of a Poker Player. It was agreed between us that if young Storm had lost all his money we would subscribe enough as a loan to take care of him until he got a remittance from home. We knew quite well that the offering of money to him would be a very delicate matter, but it was agreed that Smith should take this in hand if we saw the offer was necessary.. ""I resolved to walk the deck with him in the morning, and have a frank talk over the matter. I concluded to go into the smoking-room myself, sit down beside him, see him lose some money and use that fact as a test for my coming discourse on the evils of gambling"" ""I knew this was a somewhat impudent piece of business on my part, and so I took that evening to determine how best to perform the task set for me. I resolved to go in and sit down with him, and use his loss of money as my test. The alleged Buffalo man said nothing, for he was not a person who did much talking. Storm paid no attention to me as I sat down beside him. The gambler had just dealt. It was very interesting to see the way he looked at his hand. He allowed merely the edges of the cards to show over each other, and then closed up his hand and seemed to know just what he had. Storm pushed a half-crown in front of him, and the next man. The gambler put down a half-sovereign, and the man at his left, after a moment's hesitation, shoved out an equal amount from the pile of gold in front of him. Storm increased the bet a sovereign. The gambler then put on a five-pound note. Storm said to me huskily, ""Have you any money?"". When the cards were next dealt, Storm seemed to have rather an ordinary hand. But, poor as Storm's hand was, the rest appeared to be poorer, and he raked in the cash. Storm paused a moment and then pulled towards him the money in the centre of the table and handed me my five-pound note.. Storm's hand was a remarkable one, after he had drawn two cards, but I did not know whether it had any special value or not. The other players drew three cards each, and the gambler took one. This went on for two or three deals, and finding that, as Storm was winning all the time, although not heavily, I was not getting an object lesson against gambling, I made a move to go. ""Stay where you are,"" whispered Storm to me.. Storm said, ""I see your bet, and raise you another sovereign."" The gambler, without saying a word, shoved forward some more gold. After that I had to feed in to him five-pound notes, keeping count of their number on my fingers as I did so. He shot a glance now and again from under his eyebrows at the young man opposite. Storm had won sufficient to cover the bet and raise it.. ""Put down another five-pound note, if you dare,"" the gambler said. ""I'll bet you twenty pounds against your five- pound note,"" he added. ""That isn't poker,"" said Storm. ""You have been called. What have you got?"" ""I call you,"" he said.. The gambler sat opposite him calm and imperturbable. Storm asked him to show his hand. The gambler put down on the table four aces. Storm shouted: ""Can you tell me what this card is?"" ""I am sure I don't know,"" answered the gambler, quietly, ""probably the nine of hearts"" Storm shouted again: ""It is the nine"". Storm's hands were trembling with excitement as he pulled the pile of bank notes and gold towards him. He counted out what I had given him, and passed it to me under the table. ""Another five pounds,"" he whispered; ""sit where you are"" ""Nonsense,"" I said, ""another five pounds will certainly mean that you lose, everything you have won"" ""Very well, I shall not stay here any longer,"" he said.. The gambler hesitated for a second, then he put a ten-pound note on Storm's five-pounds. Storm at once saw him, and raised him ten. The gambler said, ""I shall not bet. What have you got?"" Storm laughed and threw his cards face up on the table. ""I have bluffed you for once,"" he said. ""It is very often done,"" answered the gambler.. Although it was Storm's deal, the gambler had the pack of cards in his hand idly shuffling them to and fro. ""I have often heard"

Many there were who would have been glad to venture a bow shot at him. The Baron did not propose to ride unthinkingly out, and straightway fall into an ambush. He and his knights were waiting for the word to mount. The warder was slowly opening the huge gates that hung between the two round entrance towers of the castle. It was the Baron's custom never to ride out at the head of his men until the great leaves of the strong gate fell full apart, and showed the green landscape beyond.. Baron was waiting at the gates of his castle. A parchment was nailed to the outer gate. The Baron demanded to know what had happened to the parchment. The warder told him what had been written on it. ""Then tear it down and bring it to me,"" cried the Baron. ""I want to see it"" said the warder, ""and I want it now!"" The Baron ordered him to bring it down.. The warder had been loath to meddle with it, in terror of that witchcraft which he knew pertained to all written characters. But he feared the Black Baron's frown even more than the fiends who had undoubtedly nailed the documents on the gate. So, breathing a request to his patron saint for protection, he tore the document from its fastening and brought it, trembling, to the Baron. The knights crowded round as von Grunewald held the parchment in his hand, bending his dark brows upon it, for it conveyed no meaning to him. Neither the Baron nor his knights could read. ""What foolery, think you, is this?"" he said, turning to the knight nearest him. ""A Defiance?"". ""Bring hither old Father Gottlieb,"" he commanded, and two of those waiting ran in haste towards the scullery of the place. ""I am no clerk,"" he answered. ""Here, good father, excellent cook and humble servitor, I trust your learning has not led you to forget the learning you put to such poor advantage in the Monastery of Monnonstein,"" said the Baron. ""No, I am not,"" he replied. ""You are the only one in the castle who can read."". Father Gottlieb took the parchment handed to him by the Baron. He bowed his head and made the sign of the cross upon his breast. The sense of his captivity faded from him as he realised that the long arm of the Church had extended within the impregnable walls of that tyrannical castle. The monk became once more the scholar of the monastery. The Baron roared: ""Cease that mummery,"" roared the Baron, ""and read without more waiting or the rod's upon thy back again. Who sends us this?"" The monk replied: ""It is from our Holy Father the Pope"". Baron von Grunewald was sent a message from the Pope. The message was a ban of excommunication against the Baron. The Baron's servants and even his sixteen knights turned pale at the news. The monk read out the awful words of the message, piling curse on curse with sonorous voice. ""Which means thyself, worthy Father. Read on, good clerk, and let us hear it to the end."" The Baron saw his trembling servitors turn pale. Even his 16 knights, companions in robbery and rapine, fall. The Baron smote the reading monk flat across the mouth, felling the old man prone upon the stones of the court. He said: ""That is my answer to our Holy Father the Pope, and when thou swearest to deliver it to him as I have given it to thee, the gates are open and the way clear for thy pilgrimage to Rome"" But the monk lay where he fell and made no reply. The Baron roared: ""Well, my gentle wolves, have a few words in Latin on a bit of sheep-skin turned you all to sheep?"" He then dragged the monk into the scullery he had left and had his men-at-. The Baron flung the reins on his charger's neck, and smote the animal on the flank, causing it to trot at once to its stable. The stablemen of the castle came forward and led away the horses. The sixteen knights stood in a group together with Segfried at their head, waiting with some anxiety on their brows for the next move in the game. The Baron, his sword drawn in his hand, strode up and down before them, his brow bent on the ground, evidently struggling to get the master hand over his own anger. ""There will be no riding to-day,"" he said, his voice ominously lowering. ""Besides, we are noble all, and do not hold with the raising of a mailed hand against an unarmed. Baron asked Segfried to draw his own sword. The knight refused. Baron said he feared neither mailed nor unmailed hand. If it came to blows the odds were against him and he was too shrewd a man to engage himself single-handed in such a contest. He said he would uphold the feudal law at the peril of his own body. But if that comes not in question, no more need be said, he said. The Baron then said: ""I am glad that point is firmly fixed in your minds. I thought a moment since that I would be compelled to uphold the law at a peril of my own body"" The knight replied: ""No one doubts your courage, my Lord,"" he said, ""neither is it any reflection on mine that in answer to your challenge my sword remains in its scabbard"". ""A woman is a different matter, my Lord,"" said Segfried uneasily. The Baron laughed and so did some of the knights, openly relieved to find the tension of the situation relaxing. ""You are excellent in a melee, but useless at the council board,"" said the Baron. ""Look round you at these stout walls; no engine that man has yet devised can batter a breach in them."" He waved his hand towards the overflowing well, charged with carbonic acid gas. ""Here in our court bubbles forever this good spring, excellent to drink when wine gives out, and medicinal in the morning when too much wine has been taken in"" The Baron's face was aglow with enthusiasm, all traces of his former temper vanishing from his brow. ""Comrades!"" cried the Baron, his face aglow. ""We have ten years' supply of stolen grain. Baron von Stern said, ""Now I ask you, can this Castle of Grunewald ever be taken--excommunication or no excommunication?"" A simultaneous shout of ""No! Never!"" arose from the knights. The Baron stood looking grimly at them for several moments. Then he said in a quiet voice, ""Yes, the Castle ofGrunew Wald can be taken. Not from without but from within"" ""If any crafty enemy sows dissension among us; turns the sword of comrade against comrade; then falls the Castle,"" he said. ""To-day we have seen how nearly that has been done"". The knights looked at one another in silence, then cast their eyes to the stone-paved court, all too shamed-faced to attempt reply to what all knew was the truth. The Baron, a deep frown on his brow, gazed sternly at the chap-fallen group. ""Such was the effect of the first shaft shot by good Abbot Ambrose, what will be the result of the second?"" asked the Baron. ""There will be no second,"" said Segfried stepping forward. ""We must sack the Monastery, and hang the Abbot and his craven monks in their own cords."" ""Good,"" cried the Baron, nodding his head in approval, ""the worthy Abbot, however, trusts not only in God, but in walls three cloth yards thick. The knights were silent. They knew the Monastery was as impregnable as the castle. It was the only spot for miles round that had never owned the sway of Baron von Grunewald. None of them were well enough provided with brains to venture a plan for its successful reduction. A cynical smile played round the lips of their over-lord, as he saw the problem had overmatched them. At last he spoke and said: ""We must meet craft with craft"" The Pope's Ban cast such terror among my good knights, steeped to the gauntlet in blood, think you, said the knight. The trustful monks know that it has been launched against us, therefore are they doubtless waiting for us to come to the monastery, and lay our necks under the feet of their Abbot, begging his clemency.. ""You Segfried, owe me some reparation for this morning's temporary defection, and to you, therefore, do I trust the carrying out of my plans"" ""There was always something of the monk about you, Segfried,"" he says. ""Draw, then, your longest face, and think of the time when you will be a monk, as Ambrose is"" ""Go to the Monastery of Monnonstein in most dejected fashion, and unarmed. Ask in faltering tones, speech of the Abbot, and say to him, as if he knew nought of it, that the Pope's Ban is on us"". Segfried accepted the commission, and the knights warmly expressed their admiration of their master's genius. As the great red sun began to sink behind the westward hills that border the Rhine, Segfried departed on horseback through the castle gates, and journeyed toward the monastery with bowed head and dejected mien. ""Taunt them with fear of the pestilence if they hesitate, and that will bring them,"" said Segfried. ""They will be as helpless as one surgeon on a battle-field. Taunt them."" ""I am not a man of the sword, but of the grace of God,"" said the monk. ""I will not kill you, but I will kill you if you kill me."" ""We are ready to deliver up the castle and all its contents to the care of the holy Church, so that the Abbot but sees our tortured souls safely directed towards the gates. The Baron and his sturdy knights sat in the darkness, with growing impatience, in the great Rittersaal listening for any audible token of the return of Segfried and his ghostly company. At last in the still night air there came faintly across the plain a monkish chant growing louder and louder, until finally the steel-shod hoofs ofSegfried's charger rang on the stones of the causeway leading to the castle gates. The gates remained open, and as darkness fell, a lighted torch was thrust in a wrought iron receptacle near the entrance at the outside, throwing a fitful, flickering glare under the archway and into. The monks were led into the deserted courtyard by the Abbot. The warder and his assistants stood behind the two heavy open leaves of the gates. Down the wide stairs from the Rittersaal came the clank of armour and rude shouts of laughter. Newly lighted torches flared up here and there, illuminating the courtyard. dangling against the northern wall a score of ropes with nooses at the end of each. Into the courtyard clattered the Baron and his followers. The Abbot stood with arms folded, pressing a gilded cross across his breast. The silence was rudely broken by the ponderous clang of the closing gates and the ominous rattle of bolts being thrust into their places with the jingle of heavy chains. ""Peace be upon this house and all within"". Baron Grunewald was a head taller than his frightened, cowering brethren. His pale countenance betokened his office and the Church. But the angry eagle flash of his piercing eye spoke of the world alone and the field of conflict. The Baron bowed low to the Abbot and said: Welcome, my Lord Abbot, to my humble domicile! It has long been the wish of my enemies to stand within its walls. There is little to be made of it from without."" The Abbot replied: ""I and my brethren are come hither on an errand of mercy, and under the protection of your knightly word"" The Baron raised his eyebrows in surprise at this, and, turning to Segfried, he said in angry tones: ""Is. ""Safe conduct is implied when an officer of the Church is summoned to administer its consolations to the dying,"" said the Abbot. ""There was no word of safe conduct between us"" ""It is not my intention that you should die without having time to repent of the many wicked deeds you have doubtless done during your lives,"" he said. ""Your sentence is that ye be hanged at cockcrow to-morrow, which was the hour when, if your teachings cling to my memory, the first of your craft turned traitor to his master"" ""If my follower had pledged my word regarding your safety, I would now open the gates and let you free,"" he added. ""As he has not done so, I shall choose a manner for your exit more in keeping with your lofty aspirations"". The hanging is a device of my own, of which I am perhaps pardonably proud, and it pleases me that it is to be first tried on so worthy an assemblage. With much labour we have elevated to the battlements an oaken tree, lopped of its branches, which will not burn the less brightly next winter. The ropes are tied to this log, and at the cry 'So die all Christians,' I have some stout knaves in waiting up above with levers, who will straightway fling the log over the battlement on which it is now poised. The instant after your broken necks will impinge against the inner coping of the northern wall. Thus you will hang yourselves, and so remove some responsibility from my perhaps overladen conscience.. ""Baron von Grunewald, I ask of you that you will release one of us who may thus administer the rites of the Church to his brethren and receive in turn the same from me"" ""Now, out upon me for a careless knave!"" cried the Baron. ""I had forgotten that; it is so long since I have been to mass and such like ceremonies myself"" ""Your request is surely most reasonable, and I like you the better that you keep up the farce of your calling to the very end"" ""And now good-night, my Lord Abbot, and a happy release for you all in the morning"" ""Good-night!"" replied the Baron, ""I will ask good Father Gottlieb to wait upon you, and he will shrive with any in the land"". The Baron and his knights returned up the broad stairway that led to the Rittersaal. Most of the torches were carried with them. The courtyard was in darkness, but the top of the highest turrets were silvered by the rising moon. The doomed men stood with the halters about their necks, as silent as a row of spectres. ""Good-night, my Lord,"" said the Baron, ""and now, again, good-night."" The Baron was killed by a poisoned arrow in the battle for the castle in 1205. The battle was fought in the courtyard of the Ritteraal, which is now known as the Baron's Castle.. Father Gottlieb acquitted himself of his task as well as his agitation and trembling hands would let him. The Abbot whispered in his ear: ""There is a time to weep and a time for action. Unloosen quickly the bonds around me, and slip this noose from my neck."" The monk was taken to the abbot's chambers and held in a cell until he could be freed. He was later released and returned to his duties as a monk. The abbot was later taken to his chambers and freed from the noose. The monk's cell was later freed and he was taken back to his post.. The monk was told to mix the wine with brandy. He returned to his superior. The Abbot absolved him of any wrongdoing. The monk was then allowed to leave the monastery. The monastery was later destroyed. The monks were never found. The abbot was never found, and the monastery was never destroyed. It was destroyed by the Nazis. The Abbey was later demolished by the Germans, and it was later consumed by theNazis. the monks were later found and absolved of all wrongdoing. the Abbey was eventually destroyed. the monk was later freed.. Gottlieb hurried away, as the knights were already clamouring for more wine. As the night wore on and the moon rose higher, the sounds of revelry increased. Once there was a clash of arms and much uproar, which subsided under the over-mastering voice of the Black Baron. It will be some compensation for what, I fear, thou hast already suffered,"" he said. ""I am now Baron von Stern. Gottlieb stole stealthily out and told the Abbot that all the knights were stretched upon the floor, and the Baron had his head on the table, beside his overturned flagon. The sentinel snored upon the stone bench. The monks all seemed frightened at this, and wished themselves once more within the monastery, able to say all's well that ends so. ""We came to convert these men to Christianity, and our task is still to do,"" said the Abbots. ""Not so,"" replied the Ab Bot. ""I can now unbar the gate,"" said Father Gottlieb, ""and we may all escape."" The monks seemed frightened, but none ventured to offer counsel to the gaunt man who led them. The Ab. ""Carry them out,"" said the Abbot, ""and lay them in a row, their feet towards the spring and their heads under the ropes"" The knights and their master were tied up as they themselves had been tied.. The Black Baron moaned uneasily in his drunken sleep, and alone in the silence, with the row of figures like effigies on a tomb beside him, paced up and down through the night, as the moon dropped lower and lower, in the heavens. There was a period of dark before the dawn, and at last the upper walls began to whiten with the coming day, and the Black Baron began to sleep again. The Black Baron was found dead in his bed, and his body was covered with a blanket. He had been killed by his own servants, and had been buried in a shallow grave. The Abbot had taken off his robes of office and handed them to Father Gottlieb, saying significantly: ""The lowest among you that suffers and is true shall be exalted"". The Black Baron was the first to come to his senses and realise dimly, at first, but afterwards more acutely, the changed condition of affairs. He then saw that the tall, ascetic man before him had doffed the Abbot's robes and wore a sword by his side, and from this he augured ill. The Black Baron then saw the empty noose swaying slightly in the morning breeze above him. His eye wandered apprehensively to the emptyNoose. swaying in the breeze above. him. The Abbot then asked Gottlieb to get a flagon and dash water from the spring in the faces of the sleepers.. The monks raised each prostrate man and placed him against the north wall. At the command of the Abbot the monks raised the men and placed them against the wall. ""Is it your purpose to hang me, Baron?"" asked the Baron. ""I swear to heaven, it was not. 'Twas but an ill-timed pleasantry,"" replied the Abbots. ""The Abbot Ambrose is dead. He was foully assassinated last night. In his place stands Conrad von Stern, who answers for his deeds to the Emperor, and after him,. The knights all swore, with many rounded oaths, that their over-lord spoke the truth, and nothing was further from their intention than an execution. ""Had I wished to hang you I would have done so last night,"" said the Baron. ""Will you then, Baron, beg admittance to Mother Church, whose kindly tenets you have so long outraged?"" ""Wait till I have the upper hand again,"" whispered the Baron to Segfried, who stood next to him.. The knights all echoed aloud the Baron's pious first remark, and, perhaps, in their hearts said ""Amen"" to his second. The good men began to fear that it was the Abbot's intention to hang the Baron and his knights. They all vociferously proclaimed that their intentions were and had been of the most honourable kind. It is written that a man digged a pit for his enemy and fell himself therein. The Abbot said, ""I trust that is true, and that you shall live long enough to show your faith by your works"" The monks then performed the rites sacred to their office and to the serious situation of the penitents. The prisoners heaved a sigh of relief, whereupon each of the prisoner heaved an apology for their actions.. ""For God's sake, my Lord...."" screamed the Baron. The Abbot, unheeding, raised his face towards the northern wall and shouted at the top of his voice: ""So die SUCH Christians!"" A simultaneous scream rose from the doomed men, cut short as by a knife, as the huge log was hurled over the outer parapet. The seventeen victims were jerked into the air and throttled at the coping around the inner wall.Thus did the Abbot Ambrose save the souls of Baron von Grunewald and his men"
0.29,0.39,23.05967575025871,"Count Konrad von Hochstaden arrived at his castle on the Rhine at midnight. He was accompanied by a score of men who had fought in the crusades. They ate a meal and drank to the downfall of the Saracene and the triumph of the true cross.. Count Konrad found that his father, whose serious illness was the cause of his return, had been dead for months past. Konrad wandered about the castle which, during the past few years, he had beheld only in dreams by night and in the desert mirages by day.. The young Count walked back and forth on the stone paved terrace which commanded from its height such a splendid view of the winding river. He would return to the Holy Land, he said to himself, and let the castle be looked after by its custodian until the war with the heathen was ended. He was. The Count of Gottlieb saw the white tents of an encampment. The tents had been there so long that they now seemed a permanent part of the scenery. The Archbishop of Cologne is engaged in the besiegement of Schloss Bernstein. He has been there for nearly a year now.. ""The Lady of Bernstein? I thought the Baron was a widower. You need the old head as well as the young arm"" ""The old man was cut down and died gloriously, with scarcely a square inch unwounded on his whole body"" ""I thought the Lady ofBernstein was a widow?"" ""Yes, she was, but she ran up the battle flag on the northern tower and bid. ""The Archbishop has a thousand men around Bernstein. Your score would but meet the fate of the old Baron and would not better the case of those within the castle"" ""What they now need in Bernstein is not iron, but food"" ""It is possible that, with care taken at midnight, you might reprovision Bernstein so. ""My Lord, your honoured father was in his bed stricken with the long illness that came to be his undoing at the last, and we never let him know that the Baron was dead or the siege in progress"" ""I leave those nice distinctions to philosophers like thee, Gottlie. ""Set ablaze the fires on all our ovens and put the bakers at work. Call in your hundred men as speedily as possible, and bid each man bring with him a sack of wheat"" ""It will be reason enough, if any make inquiry, to say that the young Lord has returned and intends to hold feasts in. The Count waved his hand toward the broad valley and said grimly: ""There sits the Archbishop of Cologne, besieging the Castle of Bernstein"" The Captain bowed low and crossed himself. ""God prosper his Lordship,"" he said piously.. ""Excellent, my Lord, most excellent,"" replied the Captain, gleefully rubbing his huge hands one over the other. ""But it is not entirely to fight that we go. You are to act as convoy to those who carry bread to Castle Bernstein"". ""Most of them, my Lord, and drinking steadily the better to endure the dryness of the desert when we go eastward again"" ""I have a doubt if there is Rhine wine enough in the castle's vaults to do that, and the men yell. The alarm spread quickly to Castle Bernstein itself, and torches began to glimmer on its battlements. With a roar the Crusaders rushed up to the foot of the wall, as a wave dashes against a rock, sweeping the frightened bread-carriers with them. By the light of the torches Konrad saw standing on the wall a fair young girl clad in chain armour whose sparkling links gl. ""My Lady,"" shouted the Count, ""these are my forces and not the Archbishop's. I am Konrad, Count of Hochstaden."" ""The more shame, then, that you, who have fought bravely with men, should now turn your weapons against. ""Your words are welcome were I but sure of their truth,"" said the lady with deep distrust in her tone. ""I open my gates neither to friend nor to foe in the darkness,"" she added. ""We come with bread, and use the sword. ""Now,"" cried Konrad to his Captain, ""back to Schloss Hochstaden before the dawn approaches too closely, and let there be no mistake in the Archbishop's camp that you are on the way."". ""My reverenced Lady, that friendly wish shall presently be gratified"" ""I hold myself your debtor for unasked aid, and would fain see you in a place of safety."" ""I would like to see you"". The princess was standing there like a superb Goddess of the Rhine. She dared not trust her voice to answer him, fearing its faintness might disown the courage with which she had held her castle for so long. The young man took from her the sword of her father which she yielded to him with visible reluctance.. The Count and the Lady went down the steps that led from the battlements to the courtyard. A cheer went up, the first heard for many days within those walls, and the feasters, flinging their caps in the air, cried ""Hochstaden!"" The Count turned to his fair companion and said, with a. The Lady of Bernstein served each of her men a flagon of the golden wine. Each took his portion, bowing low to the lady, then doffing cap, drank first to the Emperor, and after with an enthusiasm absent from the Imperial. Konrad spoke of the wars in the East, and the brave deeds done there. He fell to like the good trencherman he was, and talked unceasingly. Now and then when Konrad gazed upon Brunhilda, his eloquent tongue faltered for a moment.. The Count of Hochstaden gave the heathen to know he was somewhat further to the east of Germany. The girl against the window seemed a member of that radiant company.. ""Yes, I was there, it is true, and sometimes--well, I have a fool of a captain, headstrong and reckless, who swept me now and then into a melee,"" he said. ""Once in the fray of course I had to plead with my sword to protect my head. The trumpeter blew valiantly, giving to the echoing roof the war cry of the generations of fighting men it had sheltered. The martial music rang out in the still morning air and was echoed mockingly by the hills on the other side of the river.. ""Once again,"" said Konrad. ""For a second time the battle blast filled the valley"" The Count of Hochstaden was awaiting him on the battlements. Cologne himself had not entrusted the business to an envoy, and it was also encouraging to note that he came so poorly attended, for when a man has made up his mind to succumb he wishes as few witnesses as possible.. ""I am Konrad, Count of Hochstaden, and your Lordship's vassal"" ""I assure you I had less than a thousand rascals at my back last night, and yet nothing would appease them"" ""You have me and my peaceful nature to thank, my Lord"". The Archbishop turned on his horse and gazed on the huge bulk of Schloss Hochstaden, and there a wonderful sight met his eye. The walls bristled with armed men, the sun glistening on their polished breastplates like the shimmer of summer lightning.. ""I hold it a scandal,"" said the Count, ""that a prince of the Church should assault Christian walls"" ""I ask you to withdraw your forces immediately to Cologne,"" he said. ""I strongly suspect"" that the army would go to Cologne.. The Lady of Bernstein bowed, but made no answer. She blushed deeply that the Count still held her hand, but she did not withdraw it. ""What!"" cried Brunhilda in sudden anger, snatching her hand from his. ""Do you think you can carry me by storm as you. He stood before her with outstretched palm, and she gazed steadfastly at him, breathing quickly. At length a smile dissolved the sternness of her charming lips, she glanced at his extended"
0.78,0.88,61.4063215758131,"The hunting chalet was a large, broad apartment, with a large fireplace. Heavy timbers, blackened with age and smoke, formed the ceiling. The long, low, diamond-paned window in the middle of the wall opposite the door, had been shuttered as completely as possible. On the opposite side from the shuttered window was a door, heavily barred. It was a stormy and tempestuous one, the rain lashing wildly against the chalets roof. The chalett had seen many a merry hunting party gathered under its ample roof. It had been a hunting ch alet for many years. The hunting party had been led by a man named  John Bennett.. A score of men, all with swords at their sides, sat around a table. Flagons were scattered upon the table, and a barrel of wine stood in a corner of the room. The assemblage was brought about by some high purport, of a nature so serious that it stamped anxiety on every brow. It was evident that this was no ordinary drinking party, and that the assemblages was brought to life by some. The hunting chalet stood in a wilderness, near the confines of the kingdom of Alluria, twelve leagues from the capital. No servants were present, and each man who wished a fresh flagon of wine had to take his measure to the barrel in the corner and fill for himself. The principal speaking parts were taken by the obstinate, rough-spoken Baron Brunfels, on the one hand, and the crafty, fox-like ex-Chancellor Steinmetz on the other. ""I will not have the King killed,"" said the Baron. ""Such a proposal goes beyond what was intended when we banded ourselves together.. ""It is justice rather than assassination,"" said the ex-Chancellor suavely. ""You have learned that cant word in the Cabinet of the King himself, before he thrust you out"" ""If Rudolph escape, he will take up his abode in a neighbouring territory, and there will inevitably follow plots and counter-plots for his restoration,"" he said. ""We shall thus be involved in difficulties at home and abroad, and all for what?"" ""I am a conspirator, but not an assassin,"" replied the Baron. ""I have no wish to compass his death, either directly or through gabbling of justice"" ""I will not be killed by a man who is an enemy to each of us,"" said Rudolph.. Brunfels was about to break out again with some strenuousness in favour of his own view of the matter. Count Staumn made a proposition that was eagerly accepted by all save Brunfels himself. Let us throw, therefore, for the life of the King, said Count Staums. The Baron was too seasoned a gambler to object to such a mode of terminating a discussion. The law, of which you are so distinguished a representative, is often compared to a lottery, so you cannot look with disfavour upon a method that is conclusive, and as reasonably fair as the average decision of a judge. The King's life or death was to be decided by a dice box, and the Baron was to throw the dice.. Baron Brunfels was to act for the King, and Chancellor Steinmetz for the State. The King's life was to be forfeit if the Chancellor won the game. The game was held in a secret rendezvous in the King's palace. The king was killed by a sword-wielding man who had been waiting outside. The conspirators were shocked when the door was opened by the twenty-first man outside. They were then forced to give up their plan. The next day the King was killed. The plot was exposed and the king was executed by a swordsman who was waiting outside the palace to kill the King. The conspiracy was revealed. The trial was to take place in front of a large crowd.. The Count left the table and, stealthily as a cat, approached the door. Ex-Chancellor Steinmetz rose to his feet with chattering teeth, and terror in his eyes. ""My house is already filled,"" spoke up the Count. ""I have no room for another."" ""Open the door peacefully,"" cried the outlander, ""and do not put me to the necessity of forcing it."" ""I will not be forced,"" said the Count, "". ""In the fiend's name,"" hissed Baron Brunfels, ""if you are so frightened when it comes to a knock at the door, what will it be when the real knocks are upon you?"" The door was immediately closed and barred behind him, and the stranger flung off his cloak, throwing it over the back of a chair; then he removed his hat with a sweep, sending the raindrops flying. The intriguants gazed at him, speechless, with varying emotions. The stranger looked over his shoulder with an expression that plainly said: ""What am I to do?"" The Baron said: ""Whether he leave the place or no, there are twenty men here to answer."". If the King had any suspicion of his danger, he gave no token of it. On his smooth, lofty forehead there was no trace of frown, and no sign of fear. His was a manly figure, rather over, than under, six feet in height. Not slim. The King of England was a tall, dark man with a sweeping moustache and a black beard. He was dressed in a black cloak, with spurs jingling as he strode to the fireplace. He asked the Count of Staumn if he would act as cup-bearer. The Count agreed, and the King said they would drown the memory of a barred door in a flagon of wine. The King said he had ridden hard in order to have the pleasure of drinking with the Count and his friends. He then turned his back on the company and stood with his back to the fire, spreading out his hands to the blaze. He looked at them with piercing intensity, and more than one quailed under it. He said:. The King gave a toast to his guests. The toast was to the storm that was raging without him. The King drank off the wine and returned it to the Count. The crowd rose to their feet when the King gave the toast. They thought the King was playing with them, as a tiger plays with its victims. He was not there. He had gone. The people were shocked. They were shocked by his easy confidence. They had no idea what was going on. They did not know what to say. They could not believe it. They feared it. It was a trap. It had to be stopped. They knew it. But they could not do it. The king was not here. He could not be seen.. Brunfels was a man of the sword, and a despiser of diplomacy. The anxiety of all was that some one should persuade the King they were merely a storm-besieged hunting party. They trembled in anticipation of Brunfels' open candor, and dreaded the revealing of the real cause of their conference. Some startling rumour must have reached the King's ear to bring him thus unexpectedly upon them. They feared that at any moment he might blurt out the purport of the meeting. More than one was thankful for the crafty ex-Chancellor's planning, who throughout had insisted there should be no documentary evidence of their designs.. The King asked the Baron to be seated. The Baron stood up. The King said: ""I ask you to sit down"" The Baron remained standing. The king said: ""If a man does not value his own head, how can he be expected to care for the heads of his neighbours?"" The Baron sat down. The Queen said: 'I am sorry, my Lord of Brunfels. Whose life is in the cast?' The Baron replied: 'My life is not in the casts' The King replied:  ""I. ""I beg your gracious permission to explain the reason of our gathering,"" said the ex-Chancellor. ""The man who begins a game must play it to the end, even though he finds luck running against him,"" said Herr Steinmetz. ""Your Majesty,"" spoke up the Baron, a ring of defiance in his voice, ""I speak not for my comrades, but for myself. I begin no game that I fear to finish"" The smile returned to the King's lips. ""I have ever chided myself for loving you,"" he said, ""for you were always a bad example to weak and impressionable natures"" ""I could not but admire your sturdy honesty,"" he added, ""even when your overbearing, obstinate intolerance compelled. ""I have this to say,"" roared Baron Brunfels, drawing his sword, ""that whatever may befall this assemblage, you, at least, shall not live to boast of it."" The King stood unmoved as Baron BrunFels was about to rush upon him. Count Staumn and others threw themselves between the Baron and his victim, seeing in the King's words some intimation of mercy to be held out to them, could but actual assault upon his person be prevented. ""Your ancestors have often drawn it, but always for, and never against the occupant of the Throne,"" said the King, calmly, ""sheath your sword"" ""We have had enough of comedy and now tragedy sets in,"" he said. ""Those who are traitors to their ruler must not be surprised if a double. ""You shall not be disappointed, but shall play out the game of life and death. Each dices with his opposite. He who throws the higher number escapes. The man who throws. the lower places his weapons on the empty chair, and stands. against yonder wall to be executed for the traitor that he is. Thus half of your company shall live, and the other half seek death with such courage as may be granted them. Do you agree, or shall I give the signal?""With unanimous voice they agreed, all excepting Baron Brunfels, who spoke not. The dice rolled out on the table; a three, a four, and a one. ""Very well,"" replied the Baron nonchalantly. ""Steinmetz, the dice-box is near your hand: throw. Baron Brunfels carelessly threw the dice into their receptacle, and a moment after the spotted bones clattered on the table. ""Lord, if I only had such luck when I played for money!"" cried the Baron. ""Seize him; disarm him, and bind him,"" commanded the King. ""I swear I understood that we were to have three chances,"" shrieked Steinmetz, springing from his chair. ""But it is all illegal, and not to be borne."". Steinmetz, struggling and pleading for mercy, was speedily overpowered and bound. ""There are enough gentlemen in this company to see that the rules of the game are adhered to,"" said Staumn. The Count arose from his chair, bowed first to the King and then to the assembled company; drew forth his sword, broke it over his knee, and walked to the wall of the condemned. The men ranged against the wall were downcast, for however bravely a soldier may meet death in hostile encounter, it is a different matter to face it bound and helpless at the hands of an executioner. The remainder of the fearful contest was carried on in silence, but with great celerity, and before a quarter of an hour was past, ten men had their backs to thewall, while the remaining ten were seated at the table, some on one side, and some on the other. The King still occupied the position he had taken at the first, with his back towards the. Baron Brunfels was sentenced to death for his part in the murder of ten of his subjects. He asked the King for the chance to speak his mind freely. The King agreed, and the Baron took his sword from his scabbard. He said that he was a traitor, and that his ancestors had never turned their swords against their sovereign. He also said that the King had made himself a brother to the demagogue at the street corner, yearning for the cheap applause of the serf. The Baron said he would give his life for the life of Steinmetz, in exchange for his freedom to speak freely about the King. The king agreed. The pair were freed and returned to their homes. The next day, the King and Baron were reunited and the pair were married.. ""And for what?"" echoed the King with rising voice. ""For this; that the ploughman on the plain may reap what he has sown"" ""What fault have you to find with the programme, my Lord Baron?"" replied the King calmly. ""The simple fault that it is the programme of a fool"" ""You have shorn nobility of its privileges, and for this?"" ""Yes, my King. For what?"" ""That my nobles shall deal honestly with the people, and not use their position for thievery and depredation"" ""And that bloodthirsty swashbucklers shall not go up and down inciting the people to carnage and rapine under the name of patriotism"" ""Yes. This is the task I set myself when I came to the Throne. What fault have I found?"". ""The people,"" said the King soberly, ""have been misled. Their ear has been abused by calumny and falsehood"" ""You have impoverished us so that the clowns may have a few more coins with which to muddle in drink their already stupid brains,"" replied the Queen. ""You are hated in cot and castle alike. You would not stand in your place for a moment, were not an army behind you"" ""I am confident I would have had their undivided support, even though my nobles deserted me."" ""They see no farther than the shining florin that glitters on their palm"" ""What care they for rectitude of government? They see no further than the shine of the moon"". Rudolph of Alluria: ""I go the more jauntily to my death that I have had fair speech with you before the end"" ""I thought,"" he said slowly, ""until to-night, that I had possessed some qualities at least of a ruler of men"" ""Although there are brave men in this assembly, yet I had the ordering of events as I chose to order them, notwithstanding that odds stood a score to one against me"" ""The people have to sweat to wring from traders the reluctant silver,"" he added. ""And so they spit upon your name, and shrug their shoulders, when your honesty is mentioned"" ""And now, Rudolph, I have done, and I go,"" he concluded. ""I have done."". ""I have seen to-night more property in flames than all my savings during the last eight years would pay for,"" he said. ""I have no horsemen at my back, and have stumbled here blindly, having lost my way in every sense of the phrase,"" he added. ""While you were dicing to settle the fate of an already deposed King, and I was sentencing you to a mythical death, we were all alike being involved in common ruin,"" he continued. ""It is equally disastrous for them to plot against their leader, and it is even more disastrous for me to be involved in it."" ""I still venture to think that whatever failures have attended my eight years' rule arose from faults of my own, and not through imperfections in the plan, or want of appreciation in the people. ""Not towards the frontier!"" cried Baron Brunfels, grasping again his sword and holding it aloft. ""We will surround you, and hew for you a way through that fickle mob back to the throne of your ancestors"" Rudolph smiled and shook his head. ""Not so,"" he said. ""I leave a thankless throne with a joy I find it impossible to express"" ""I was filled with amazement to think that men would actually fight for the position of ruler of the people,"" said Rudolph. ""As I sat on horseback, half-way up the hill above the burning city, and heard the clash of arms, I was filled With amazement"". ""Gentlemen, drink with me to the new President of Alluria, whoever he may be"" But the King drank alone, none other raising flagon to lip. Then Baron Brunfels cried aloud: ""Gentleman: the King!"" Never in the history of Allurian history was a toast so heartily honoured."
0.9,1.0,77.17073170731707,"The captain of the Arrowic went blundering across the bar yesterday in one of the densest fogs of the season. All that can be known at present is, that, when the fog lifted, the splendid steamer Dartonia was lying at anchor in the bay, having missed the tide. If the fog was too thick for the Dartonia to cross the bar, how, then, did the captain ofthe Arrowic get his boat out? The captain ofThe Arrowic should be taught to remember that there are other things to be thought of beside the defeating of a rival steamer. ""There is nothing more certain than that some day we will have to record a terrible disaster directly traceable to ocean racing"" – Sir Ken Robinson. ""If you want to know how to win a race, go to the races"" – Captain Ken Robinson, The Daily Mail, September 25, 2013. ""The Daily Mail"" has a weekly race report from Queenstown, Ireland.. The editorial was cabled across to London and made pleasant reading for the captain of the Arrowic at Queenstown. He should be made to understand that he has under his charge a steamer worth a million and a half of dollars, and a cargo probably nearly as valuable. He had also in his care nearly a thousand human lives, and these he should not be allowed to juggle with in order to beat all the rival steamers in the world. The captain didn't say anything about it; he was not a talkative man. Probably he explained to his chief, if the captain. of an ocean liner can possibly have a chief, how he got his vessel out of New York harbour in a fog. But, if he did, the explanation was never made public, and so here's an account of it published for the first time, and it may give a pointer to the. captain of a rival liner Dartonia. I may say, however, that the purser was not as silent as the captain, and he may have explained to the captain how he managed to. The purser was angry the whole way from Queenstown to Liverpool. He was very indignant at what he called the outrage of the New York paper. He knew I was a newspaper man myself, and probably that is the reason he launched his maledictions against the fraternity at my head. ""Just listen to that wretched penny-a-liner,"" he said, rapping savagely on the paper with the back of his hand. ""I don't see any cheek in it,"" I said, as soothingly as possible. ""Here is some young fellow, who probably never saw the inside of a ship in his life, and yet he thinks he can tell the captain of a great ocean liner what should he done and what shouldn't"". The purser was not in a good temper when he made his remarks. He said newspaper men acted as if they did know everything. They pretend in their papers that every man thinks he knows how to run a newspaper or a hotel. But look at their own case. See the advice they give to statesmen. See how they would govern Germany, or England, or any other country under the sun. Is there a great railway smash-up, the newspaper man shows exactly how it could have been avoided if he had had the management of the railway. He tells both sides what they should do during a big strike. He is a newspaper man, not a politician. He should be excused, for, as I said, he was not on his best form. He was not even in a very good temper.. ""And how do you know he can't,"" I asked. But the purser would not listen to reason. He contended that a captain who had crossed the ocean hundreds of times and for years and years had worked his way up, had just as big a sense of responsibility for his passengers and his ship and his cargo as any newspaper man in New York could have. And this palpably absurd contention he maintained all the way to Liverpool. And so it went. And it went on. And on. and on. until the end of the world. And the end. of the day, and the beginning of the beginning. And I am sure most men could run a newspaper as well as the newspapers are conducted now. But not every man thinks he can run a hotel, or a newspaper.. The Arrowic and the Dartonia left on the same day and within the same hour. We on board the Arrowic could see the same bustle and stir on boardThe Dartonia that we ourselves were in the midst of. The Dartonia was timed to leave about half an hour ahead of us. We heard the frantic ringing of her last bell warning everybody to get on shore who were not going to cross the ocean. The Arrowic left about 2pm and the Dartonia left about 5pm. The Arrowic and the dartonia left on the same day and within the same hour, from wharfs that were almost adjoining.. The Dartonia was a splendid vessel, and ""even the ranks of Tuscany could scarce forbear a cheer,"" says the author. The ship was so foggy that one could hardly see three boats' length ahead or behind. The passengers were cheering and clapping as the ship backed slowly out from her wharf. It was a great sight on the wharf, which was covered with people, ringing with cheers, and white with the flutter of handkerchiefs. The Dartonia is now a much-loved and much-missed vessel. It has been restored to its former glory and is now one of the world's most popular steamships. The Arrowic is now a more modest vessel, with a much smaller crew. It is a much more modest ship than the Dartonia, and has a much shorter crew. The Arrowic is now the most popular ship in the world, and the crew is much smaller.. The Dartonia came to a standstill as the fog closed in. A big three-masted vessel dashed past us only a few yards behind the stern of the mammoth steamer. ""Look at that blundering idiot,"" said the purser to me, ""rushing full speed over crowded New York Bay in a fog as thick as pea-soup"" The ship's bell was rung continually forward and somebody was whanging on the gong towards the stern. The fog lifted clear from shore to shore and the Dartonia was visible again. But the journey was delayed by a day and the ship was unable to get over the bar that day. The Dartonia finally arrived at the end of the trip on the 18th July. The ship was carrying 2,000 passengers and crew, and the trip was expected to take three days. It was the first time the ship had left New York Harbor since the Second World War.. The Dartonia was anchored off the coast of Norway. The captain of the ship was trying to get the ship over the bar. The fog was thick, and the wind was strong. A nautical passenger saw what the captain was doing. He said, ""A captain who would do a thing like that ought to be hanged"" The captain was trying a plan to get his ship to safety. The ship made some progress towards the bar, but then the fog lifted again and the captain stopped. The Dartonia had thrown out her anchor chain and was waiting for the fog to clear. The German steamers were also at anchor, but were waiting for it to clear too, he said. The boat made it to safety, but the captain had to wait for the wind to subside before the ship could get off. The crew of the Dartonia were now on their way back to Norway.. The captain stood on the bridge and beside him the pilot, but the fog was now so thick we could hardly see them. The almost incessant clanging of the bell was kept up, and in the pauses we heard answering bells from different points in the thick fog. Then, for a second time, and with equal suddenness, the fog lifted ahead of us. Behind we could not see either the Dartonia or the German steamer. Our own boat, however, went full speed ahead and kept up the pace till the. ""We are just at the bar,"" said the nautical passenger, ""and if this doesn't clear up pretty soon the vessel will have to go back"" The captain kept his eyes fixed on the chronometer in his hand. The fog lifted for the third time, and again the mammoth steamer forged ahead. The captain now, in pacing the bridge, had his chronometer. in his hands. The ship was carrying more than 1,000 passengers. The passengers were on the ship's first trip to the Red Sea. The journey took about two hours and 40 minutes. The steamer was carrying 1,200 passengers. It was the largest steamer in the Red Seas.. The pilot tried to peer ahead, but everything was a thick white blank. The captain closed his chronometer with a snap. We were over the bar and into the Atlantic, and that is how the captain got the Arrowic out of New York Bay. We saw it far ahead coming in from the ocean. All at once the captain closed the chronometer and we were off into the sea. The fog still was thick behind us in New YorkBay. The ship was carrying more than 1,000 passengers and crew."

The author sat at the same table as two American businessmen who had crossed the Atlantic more than fifty times. The presence of Mr. Blair gave to our table a sort of patriarchal dignity that we all appreciated..

Into that state- room has been sent a most lovely basket of flowers"" Waters says: ""There is a. ""A basket of flowers has been sent (no doubt by mistake) to our state-room"" ""There is nothing but a card on it which says 'Room 27' Steward,"" he cried, ""would you go to room. ""We all admired it very much, and the handsome young lady on my left asked Mr. Blair's permission to take one of the roses for her own"" ""I cannot grant a flower from the basket. ""Miss McMillan!"" cried the lady; ""I wonder if she is on board? I'd give anything to know"" Waters said he would not apologise. The card was returned to the table.. ""If I do not receive the thanks of Miss McMillan, it will be because good deeds are rarely recognised in this world,"" said Blair. ""Now,"" said the sentimental lady on my left, ""while you gentlemen are wasting the time in useless talk the lady is. ""When Mr. Waters interrupted me I was going to say that there seems to me a romantic tinge to this incident that you old married men cannot be expected to appreciate"" ""Here is a young lady. Her lover sends her a basket. There may be some hidden meaning that she alone will understand in. ""I will become acquainted with her. McMillan is a good Scotch name and Blair is another. On that as a basis I think we can speedily form an acquaintance. Steward, can you find out for me at what table and at what seat. ""I insist that Miss McMillan be brought to this table, and that we all hear exactly what is said to her,"" put in Mr. Waters. ""I shall then in a casual manner ask her if she knows a young man by the name of Edwin J., and I. ""Is Miss McMillan ill?"" he asked. ""No, not ill,"" replied Mrs. Kay. ""But she seems very much depressed at leaving home,. ""Miss McMillan,"" said the stewardess, ""this is Mr. Blair, who wanted to speak to you."" ""It will do her good,"" said she.

I said to myself at the time, ""You silly little handsome idiot, Lord only knows what trouble you will cause"". Mrs. Tremain was one of the loveliest women I ever saw in my life. Her dress had a great deal to do with her appearance. Women were in the habit of sniffing when Mrs. Tremains name was mentioned.. The story of the life of a young woman who fell in love with a man from Mexico. She was of Spanish-Mexican-American origin, but her husband was American. The couple were on their first trip to Europe, and she was the belle of the party.. The second day out she walked the deck with the captain, which, as everybody knows, is a very great honour. She always had a crowd of men around her, and apparently did not care the snap of her pretty fingers whether a woman on board spoke to her or not. It was quite evident to everybody on board but himself that Mrs Tremain was a. ""Of all those of us who were deserted by Mrs. Tremain none took it so hard as young Howard of Brooklyn. I liked Howard, for he was so palpably and irretrievably young, through no. Young Howard confided a good deal in me, and even went so far one time as to ask if I thought he appeared very young, and if I would believe he was really as old as he stated. He wished to be considered a man of the world, and he had. Her husband was one of those quiet men who would do something terrible if once he were aroused. ""Look at the generality of women,"" he cried bitterly; ""especially those who are what they call philanthropic. ""Now, Howard,"" I said, ""that's your cynicism which I've so often deplored. Come down to plain language, and tell me what you mean?"" ""Look at the women on board this steamer,"" he cried indignantly. ""They will fuss and mourn over some drunken wretch who cannot be reclaimed,. ""Oh yes, it's all very well to talk like that; but I would like to pitch Glendenning overboard,"" said Captain Tremain. ""Is there a woman on board of this steamer who will do it? Not one. They see as plainly as any. ""Mrs. Tremain is a married woman, and I can't see what interest you should have in her. Take my advice and leave her alone, and if you want to start a reforming crusade among women, try to convert the rest of the ladies of the ship. Mrs. Tremain seemed to be partly amused with the boy, and think it all rather good fun. Glendenning scowled somewhat, and tried to be silent; but, finding that made no particular difference, began to make allusions to the extreme youth of young. Glendenning said to Mrs. Tremain, ""I never noticed you wearing that ring before. It is a very strange ornament"" Mrs. Trevain and young Howard laughed, and Glendennings ignored both Howard and myself.. ""Put it together again,"" she cried; ""put it together quickly"" The coils of the snake were still linked together, but instead of composing one solid ring they. ""Is there a spring somewhere?"" asked Glendenning. ""Oh, I cannot tell you,"" she answered, nervously clasping and unclasping her hands. ""If. Mrs. Tremain snatched the links from Glendenning, slipped them into one ring again, put it on her finger, and dashed quickly up the stairs without saying a word of good night to any of us. ""There's sure to. ""A person who interferes in other people's affairs must do so with tact and caution"" ""Aren't you interfering now?"" he said. ""You are quite right, I am. Good night"" ""I did not see him again that night"". There in the dark was the faint outline of two persons, with their backs towards us, leaning over the stern of the ship. The vibration at this part of the boat, from the throbbing of the screw, made it impossible for them to hear our approach. They doubtless. Captain Tremain was looking for his wife, and wanted to give her a shawl. Young Howard stood looking at him with a startled expression in his eyes, and his lower jaw dropped. I tried by looks and nudges to tell young Howard to go back and give her warning.. ""Here, Howard,"" I said, ""I want to speak to Captain Tremain for a moment. Take this shawl and find Mrs. Tremain, and give it to her"" ""The country itself is rich enough in mineral wealth, if that is what you mean,"" he. ""What I wanted more particularly to know about Mexico,"" I said to the captain, ""was whether there would be any more--well, likely to have trouble"" ""Oh, I think not,"" said the captain. ""Of. ""There seems to be a row back there. I wonder what it is"" ""Oh, nothing serious, I imagine. Probably some steerage passengers have come on the cabin deck"" ""I don't think anything will happen to bring on a war"". ""Why don't you put on the shawl, my dear?"" he said to her affectionately. Then, seeing it on young Howard's arm, she laughed, and said, ""He never offered it to me"". ""Very nearly, I made a slip of the tongue. I called her Mrs. Glendenning."" ""Did you have trouble?"" ""Very nearly"" ""I was very much agitated"" ""You called her what?"". ""I suppose I acted like a fool when we met the captain, didn't I?"" ""You did,"" I answered; ""go on.""

I'll take you to the steward, he'll fix you all right"" ""I'm an honest man, I am indeed, sir. The man was in a spare wheel-house, used if anything went wrong with the one in front.
