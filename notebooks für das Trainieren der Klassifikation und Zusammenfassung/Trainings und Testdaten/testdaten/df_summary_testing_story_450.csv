And the mercury shiver perpetually in the vicinity of zero!"" ""And every foot of earth be crusty-brown and bare with no white snow at all till the very last moment when you'd just about given up hope!"" ""For purposes of propriety and general historical authenticity there are of course parents in the story. And one or two other oldish persons"" ""And if you don't like dogs I don't know just what to advise you"". The Rattle-Pane House was the subject of a Christmas story. The story was set on the night of Christmas Eve. The house had been vacant for five weeks. The author describes the story as ""a tale of a young girl and a very old man"" The story ends with the young girl's death, and the house's return to its original location. The book is published by Simon & Schuster, Inc. in the U.S. and Canada. The first edition of the book is available now.. Flame's mother gasped when she heard her daughter's news. ""I've found out who's Christmasing at the Rattle-Pane House!—It's a red-haired setter dog with one black ear! And he's sitting at the front gate this moment! Superintending the unpacking of the furniture van!"" Flame herself re-telephoned within the half hour to acknowledge her absurdity. ""Oh Mother-Funny,"" apologized Flame, ""you were perfectly right. No lone dog in. ""Oh—Fl—ame!"" panted her Mother. ""Dogs—do—not—take houses!"" It was not from the chicken-yard that she had come running this time but only from her Husband's Sermon-Writing-Room in the attic. ""Well, they've taken this one, anyway! Taken it by storm, I mean! Scratched all the green paint off the front door! Torn a hole big as a cavern in the Barberry Hedge! Pushed the sun-dial. Flame's Mother was still persisting when she returned to her husband's study. ""Dogs do not take houses!"" she affirmed with unmistakable emphasis. ""Eh? What?"" jumped her husband. ""To be 'set' and 'dreamy' both? Absolutely 'set"" on being absolutely ' dreamy'? That was Flame!"" With renewed tenacity Flame's Mother reverted to Truth as Truth. ""Flame!"" she said. ""If you want to know the truth, just ask her!"" ""Yes, Mother?"" he replied. ""Yes?"" ""Yes!"" she replied.. Flame's Mother interrupted her husband's sermon. ""Dogs? Dogs? Who said anything about dogs?"" With a gesture of impatience he snatched up his notes and tore them in two. ""I think I will write about the Garden of Eden instead!"" he rallied. ""Now if you could see your way to make a sermon that smelt like doughnuts and plum-pudding!"" she suggested. ""The season happens to be Christmas time,"" she suggested bluntly. ""You interrupted me,"" he reproached her. ""Oh mother!"" telephoned Flame almost at once, ""It's—so much nearer Christmas than it was half an hour ago!"" ""I am making doughnuts,"" confided her Mother with the faintest possible taint of asperity. ""And Father's watching them? Then I'll hurry! M—Mother?"" ""Yes, Flame?"" ""I'll hurry!"" ""It would be a shame if anything spoiled!"". Flame's mother was concerned about her daughter's behaviour. ""There is a man with them! Don't tell Father! He's so nervous about men!"" ""Oh I hope not a young man! Where did he come from?"" ""I don't think he came at all,"" confided Flame. ""He looks to me more like a person who had always been there! Like something I mean that the dogs found in the attic! Quite crumpled he is! And with a red waistcoat!"" ""I wish we had a butler!"". Flame's Mother hung up the receiver. ""Dogs—do—not—have—butlers,"" she persisted unshakenly. ""I've paid cash for the telephoning and charged the cereal"" ""There is a lady at the Rattle-Pane House!"" Flame exclaimed. ""A—A—what Father would call a Lady Maiden!—Miss—"" ""Not a real lady, I think,"" protested her Mother. ""Not with all those dogs"". Flame said, ""Why Mother, they are the most absolutely—perfectly sanitary dogs you ever saw in your life!"" Into her eager young voice an expression of ineffable dignity shot suddenly. ""No real lady I think would have so many dogs.—It—It isn't sanitary."" ""Well, I'm eighteen,"" stiffened the young. ""Somebody ought to call anyway! Call right away, I mean, before she gets any more nervous!—Oh, Mother, it's been so long since any one lived in the Rattle-Pane House!"" ""I think she must have missed her train or something!"" ""The Butler has just gone to the Station to meet her! I heard him telephoning quite frenziedly! I think she may have a lost Lover somewhere! And all sorts of pressed flowers!"" ""Oh Mother, just one little wee single minute at the door. Flame herself was escaping. She was fleeing. She had escaped. She would not be caught. She could not be found. Her mother would not find her. She escaped. Her Mother would not catch her. Flame was escaping! She would be found, she would be caught, and she would have to escape. She would not be Found. She fled. She  had escaped! She was escaping. Her mother would not have found her, she wouldn't be found her. Flame was found her mother, and she would be found. ""Christmas Time adventures ought to smell like Christmas!"" she scolded. Glint for glint her shining eyes challenged the moon. Fearful even yet that some tardy admonition might overtake her she sped like a deer through the darkness. ""Maybe if I'm ever President,"" she argued, ""I won't do so awfully well with the Tariff or things like that! But Christmas shall smell of Christmas! Not just of frozen mud! And camphor balls!... I'll have great vats of Fir Balsam essence at every street corner!"". The Rattle-Pane House is a house in a lane in Cumbria. It was abandoned when the author visited it. The house is now being used as a Christmas tree. The author describes it as 'beautiful' and 'lovely' The house has now been converted into a holiday home for the elderly. It is called the Rattle Pane House. The owner, a woman called Flame, is now living there. She is a retired school teacher. She lives in a cottage in the middle of the lane.. ""Stop, Lopsy! Behave yourself, Blunder-Blot! Sillies! Don't you know I'm the lady that was talking to you this morning through the picket fence?"" she cried. ""I knew, of course, that there were three dogs—but who ever in the world would have guessed that three could be so many?"" she added. ""Maybe I'd better not plan to make my call so—so very informal,"" she decided suddenly. ""Not at a house where there are quite so many dogs! Not at a House where there is a butler!"" she added, adding, ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be so rude."". The dogs announced her ultimate arrival. Like a drift of snow the huge wolf-hound whirled his white shagginess into the vestibule. Shrill as a banging blind the impetuous coach-dog lurched his sleek weight against the door. Without knock or ring the door-handle creaked and turned, three ecstatic shapes went hurtling through a yellow glare into the hall beyond. Flame found herself staring up into the blinking, astonished eyes of. ""I never have had an engraved card,"" she confided quite abruptly. ""But you might tell Miss Flora if you please"" ""Oh, no! It isn't asking for a subscription or anything!"" she hastened quite suddenly to explain. ""It's just a Christian call!... B—Being so nervous and lost on the train and everything ... we thought Miss FlorA might be glad to know that there were neighbors."" ""We live so near and everything.... And can run like the wind!"" she added.. ""Now,"" thrilled Flame, ""the adventure really begins"" ""Kindly announce to Miss Flora,"" she repeated with palpable crispness, ""that the Minister's Daughter is at the door!"" The Butler stepped back a single jerky pace and bowed her towards the parlor. ""Dear me ... dear me,"" shivered Flame. ""The Minister's daughter is a bit stout! And Father starts all right but usually gets thinking of something else! But I...? Kindly announce!"" she repeated. ""That the Minister’s Daughter is a little stout! and Father started all right. But I..."". ""Miss Flora!"" he announced. ""They're not going to Christmas at all ... evidently!"" ""I can bring her flowers, anyway! My very first Paper White Narcissus! My—"" ""Of a pedigree so famous ... so distinguished ... so ..."" Numerically on his fingers he began to count the distinctions. ""Five prizes this year! And three last! Do you mind the chop?"" he gloated. ""Why, I thought Miss Flora was a Lady! Why—"" ""I thought you were a Lady, Miss!"". ""Oh my Glory!"" thrilled Flame. ""The breadth! The depth!... Did you never hear of alauntes?"" he demanded. ""Is Miss Flora as old as that?"" ""Miss Flora,"" said the old Butler with some dignity, ""is young—hardly two in fact—so young that she seems to me but just weaned"" With wags and growls and yelps of joy all four dogs met in Flame's lap. ""They seem to like me, don't they?"" triumphed Flame.. ""Mother's never let me have any dogs,"" she confided. ""Mother thinks they're not,"" he said. ""Come Christmas time I wishes I was dead."" ""I can't see nothing—think nothing but mush,"" he added. ""It ain't that I mind eatin' with them on All Saints' Day or Fourth of July or even Sundays. But come Christmas Time it seems like I craves to eat with More Humans."" ""He's got cider and plum puddings. And mince pies there is. But me I mixes dog bread and milk—dog bread and Milk"". ""Not he! Not Christmas Time! It's travelling he is,"" he confided darkly. ""He travels for 'em same as some folks travels for their healths"" ""Mr. Delcote?"" quickened Flame. ""Mr., Delcotes?"" ""Mr, Delcots?"" ""He's had ... misfortunes,"" he said. ""Most especially at Christmas Time he travels for his misf fortunes"" ""He says, 'Now Barret,'—that's me, 'I trust your honor to see that the dogs ain't neglected just because it's Christmas' "". ""But this Mr. Delcote?"" puzzled Flame. ""What a perfectly horrid man he must be to give such heavenly dogs nothing but dog-bread and milk for their Christmas dinner!"" ""It don't look like a very wholesome Christmas for me,"" sighed the old Butler. ""Not either way. Not what you'd call wholesome."" ""I've never seen a dog so happy as this one,"" he said.. ""Oh, darn Mr. Delcote!"" she cried. ""How? Where? Why? When?"" Appealingly her eager eyes searched the old Butler's inscrutable face. Through the quavering fingers that he swept suddenly across his brow two very genuine tears glistened. ""Yes'm,"" repeated the old man dully. ""Oh, if this only was a Parish Call,"" she deprecated, ""I could ask questions right out loud. But being just a social. ""I'll run like the wind! No one need ever know!"" she said. ""I'll take you to the Christmas tree!"" her Mother replied. ""But of course we'll have to go! The very first thing in the morning! Christmas Day, too! And leave you all alone! It's a perfect shame! But I've planned it all out for everybody!"" ""It's your Uncle Wally!"" said her Mother. ""He's the one who's going to take you!"" ""I'm not going to tell you. Flame and her Father dropped at once every helpful thing they were doing and sat down in rocking chairs to listen to the plan. ""Yes! Every detail is all planned out!"" she asserted with a breathy sort of pride. ""You and your Father are both so flighty I don't know whatever in the world you'd do if I didn't plan out everything for you!"" ""Young men might call. The Lay Reader is almost sure to call.... He's a dear delightful soul of course, but I'm afraid he has an amorous eye."" ""All Lay Readers have amorous eyes,"" reflected her husband.. Flame's Mother: ""There are reasons ... why I prefer that Flame's first offer of marriage should not be from a Lay Reader"" Her Father: ""Taken all in all it is a great asset"" ""Flame shall go to her Aunt Minna's"" announced the dominant maternal voice. ""By driving with us to the station, she'll have only two hours to wait for her train, and that will save one bus fare!"". ""Of Father-Funny,"" whispered Flame, ""I've got such a queer little pain"" ""I think you'd better be careful to wear one of your rather longish skirts,"" said Aunt Minna. ""And oh do be sure to wipe your feet every time you come in! And don't chatter!"" ""Yes'm,"" said Flame. ""I'm in a bit of a pain."" ""Yes're,"" said the old Butler. ""You're in a little pain.""""Yes'm. I'm in such a pain"". ""I've got such a sad little pain in my Christmas,"" said Flame. ""Oh dear me! Where is it? Go and find your Mother at once!"" ""Oh it isn't that kind of a pain,"" said her Father. ""It's inMy Christmas"" ""Did you ever in your whole life spend a Christmas just exactly the way you wanted to? Honest-to-Santa Claus now,—did you ever?"" ""Why, no,"" admitted her Father after a second's hesitation. ""Why—Why, why, no"". ""I agree with you ... utterly, Father-Funny!"" said Flame. ""But ... Father,"" she persisted, ""Of all the people you know in the world,—millions would it be?"" ""Why ... no, I don't know that I ever did,"" considered her Father. ""When you're young enough to enjoy the day as a 'holler' day there's usually some blighting person who prefers to have it observed as a holy day..."" ""Well, thousands,"" accepted Flame. 'Did you ever in your life know any one who had ever spent Christmas just the way he wanted to?"". ""U—m—m,"" encouraged Flame. ""When you're little, of course,"" mused her Father, ""you have to spend the day the way your elders want you to!... You crave a Christmas Tree but they prefer stockings! You yearn to skate but they consider the weather better for corn-popping! You ask for a bicycle but they had already found a very nice bargain in flannels! You beg to dine the gay-kerchiefed Scissor-Grinder's child, but they invite the Minister's toothless mother-in-law!... And after you're married?"". ""Well, I,"" triumphed Flame, ""have got a chance to spend Christmas just exactly the way I want to!... The one chance perhaps in a life-time, it would seem!"" Flame's Mother, herself, appeared abruptly in the door. ""Are you stone deaf? Didn't you hear the telephone? Couldn't you even hear me calling? Your Uncle Wally is worse! That is he's better but he thinks he's worse! And they want us to come at once! It's something about a new will!"". Flame stood up and said she was not going to Aunt Minna's. ""Father says I don't have to!"" she protested. ""You know how Uncle Wally feels about having young people in the house!"" ""No, of course, you didn't say it with your mouth,"" admitted Flame. ""But you said it withyour skin and bones!—I could feel it working."" ""Oh, I like him—some,"" conceded Flame, ""but I'm not sure about him"" ""I don't know whether you're trying to run him down ... or run him up,"". Flame said she wanted to make a Christmas for herself. ""I like him when he leaves out the Litany,"" she said of her Father. ""Yes, I like him very much,"" she added. ""What do you want to do?"" panted her Mother. ""Make a Christmas of my own!"" said Flame. ""Oh, of course, I know perfectly well,"" she agreed, ""that I could go to a dozen places in the Parish and be cry-babied over for my presumable loneliness. And probably I should cry a little. Flame's Mother wanted to make a Christmas of her own. ""Everything about it would be brand-new and unassociated!"" she said. ""I'm almost distracted! I'm—""""When in Doubt do as the Doubters do,"" suggested Flame's Father quite genially. ""Choose the most doubtful doubt on the docket and—Flame’s got a pretty level head,"" he interrupted himself very characteristically. ""Why, yes,"" he called back, ""I quite forgot to ask"". ""I want to make a Surprise for Miss Flora,"" she confided. ""Just what kind of a Christmas is it, Flame, that you want toMake?"" Her Father asked. ""Why, at the Rattle-Pane House, you know!"" rallied Flame. ""Don't you remember that I called there this afternoon?"
0.43,0.53,32.374230908432864,"The Traveling Salesman was distinctly fat and unmistakably dressy in an ostentatiously new and pure-looking buff-colored suit. From his huge cowhide boots to the lead smouch that ran from his rough, square chin to the very edge of his astonishingly blond curls, he was one delicious mess of toil and old clothes and smiling, blue-eyed indifference.. The Young Electrician is an extraordinary, strangely mysterious, utterly unexplainable masculine face. The sort of face that almost inevitably flares up into a woman's startled vision at the one crucial moment in her life when she is not supposed to be considering alien features. It is the face of a man who has just been told that he is going to die.. The Peasant's Tale is a novel about a young man's journey through the world. The novel is about a man's struggle to find his way back to the land of his birth. The story is told through the eyes of a young boy. The author is the son of a teacher and the grandson of a farmer. The book is published by Simon & Schuster, priced £20.. ""Why, sure you can listen!"" he repeated benignly. ""Traveling alone's awful stupid, ain't it? I reckon you were glad when the busted heating apparatus in the sleeper gave you a chance to come in here and size up a few new faces"" Then, shifting his sample-case adroitly to suit his new twisted position, he began to stick cruel little prickly price. ""She don't follow you so much, I reckon, because you are her love as because you've got her love,"" he says. ""And yet—there's times when I ain't so almighty sure that her following you is. ""Oh, that's what you meant by the 'whole darned business,' was it?"" cried the Youngish Girl suddenly, edging away out to the front of her seat. Along the curve of her cheeks an almost mischievous smile began to quicken. ""Oh, yes! I heard that, too!"" she confessed cheerfully. ""By forgiving you just one more forgive. ""What was the first thing you said? What started you talking about it? Oh, please, excuse me for hearing anything at all,"" she finished abruptly. ""I've been traveling alone now for five dreadful days, all the way down from British Columbia, and—if—you—will—. ""I guess you'll have to go ahead and tell her about 'Rosie,'"" he suggested grinningly to the Traveling Salesman. ""Oh, pshaw!"" flushed the Young Electrician, crinkling up all the little smile-tissue around his blue eyes. ""Why, I tell you it wasn't anything so. ""We simply got jollying a bit in the first place about the amount of perfectly senseless, no-account truck that'll collect in a fellow's pockets,"" he said. ""Then some sort of a scorched piece of paper he had, or something, got him telling me about a nasty, sizzling close call he had to-day with a live wire"" ""Then I got telling him here. ""I don't call that an 'indiscreet letter'!"" she protested almost resentfully. ""You might call it a knavish letter. Or a foolish letter. Because either a knave or a fool surely wrote it. The Traveling Salesman asked, ""Where in creation does the 'indiscreet' come in?"" The Youngish Girl's jaw dropped. ""Why—why—I think I'd call an 'indISCreet letter' a letter that was pretty much—of a gamble perhaps,"" she said. ""But a letter, I mean, that is absolutely on the square!"" he protested.. You can poke them a little and make a guess at the shape, and you can rattle them a. ""Oh, yes, I know it sounds comic,"" he acknowledged wryly. ""But your 'Honey' and your 'Dolly Girl' andYour 'Pink-Fingered Precious' nonsense! Why, it isn't real!"" ""It doesn't even make sense!"" the Youngish Girl cried. ""It's not real! It's just nonsense!"". ""Sounds like something out of a summer vaudeville show or a cheap Sunday supplement,"" he said. ""I don't suppose it sounded so specially comic to the widow. I reckon she found it plenty-heap indiscreet enough to suit her"". 'Martha,' I says, 'Martha, it sure does beat all how we fellows that travel round so much in cars and trains are always and forever picking up automobile veils—dozens of them, dozens' 'I wouldn't wonder if my wife had as many as thirty-four tucked. The Salesman said that it's not just death that's pulling Martha down. He said that she has a sore thought. And God help the crittur with a sorethought! He said. God help anybody who's got any one single, solitary sick idea that keeps thinking on top of itself.. ""Well, who was Rosie?"" persisted the Youngish Girl absent-mindedly. ""Why, Rosie was nothing!"" snapped the Traveling Salesman; ""nothing at all—probably."" Altogether in spite of himself, his voice trailed off into a suspiciously minor key. ""But all the same,"" he continued more vehemently, ""all the same. The Salesman's gold-rimmed eyes went frowning off across the snow-covered landscape. ""Lots of things, I haven't a doubt, that would make my wife kind of mad, but nothing, I'm calculating, that she wouldn't understand"" ""Life insurance ain't by any means, in my mind, the only kind of protection that a man. The Traveling Salesman's mirth rang joyously out above the roar of the car. ""There'll be no ladies swelling round in crape at my funeral that my wife don't know by their first names!"" he said. ""Tell you about my wife?"" he repeated. ""She's little and young and was a school-teacher. ""I thought it was her fault—'most all of the first year,"" he confessed delightedly. ""And then think of her!—Little, young, a school-teacher, too, and taking poetry to read on the train same as you or I would take a newspaper! Gee! What would you expect?"" Again his mouth began to twitch a little. ""All of a sudden, one. ""So that's how I learned my table manners,"" he grinned, ""and that'sHow I learned to quit cussing when I was mad round the house"" ""That's howI learned not to come home and talk all the time about the 'peach' whom I saw on the train or the street. Traveling Salesman: A man who doesn't go to work deliberately to study and understand his wife is a fool. Women are awfully understandable if you only go at it right, he says. The only thing that riles them in the whole wide world is the fear that the man they've married ain't quite bright, he adds. ""A fellow's a fool when he marries who don't go out and find out what his wife thinks of him,"" says the Traveling. ""It's only, I tell you, that it makes a woman feel just plain silly to think that her husband don't even know as much as she does,"" he says. ""Why, a man will go out and pay every cent he's got for a good hunting dog—and then snub his wife for being the finest untrained retriever in the world"". ""Ella's a traveling man, too. Sells shotguns up through the Aroostook. Funny, ain't it, and me selling undervests? Ella's an awful smart girl. Good as gold"" ""It 'most breaks her heart if her man don't seem to care about it,"" said the Traveling Salesman.. ""Once I would have brought her down to the house for Sunday, and advertised her as a 'peach,' and a 'dandy good fellow,' and praised her eyes, and bragged about her cleverness,"" he says. ""But now—now—what I say now is: 'Wife, I'm going to bring Ella down for Sunday. You've never seen her, and you sure will hate her. ""I ain't any more than jumped off the car Saturday night when there's my little wife out on the street corner with her sweater tied over her head, prancing up and down first on one foot and then on the other"" ""She's so excited, to slip her hand in mine and tell me all about it. And she's made us a chocolate cake as big as. ""I sure talk too much,"" he muttered. ""I guess maybe you'd like half a chance to read your story."" ""I don't care a darn whether she rouges a little bit or not,"" he said. ""And you. The Traveling Salesman shrugged the compliment from his shoulders. ""Oh, I'm bright enough,"" he grumbled, ""but I ain't refined."" Slowly to the tips of his ears mounted a dark red flush of real mortification. ""There's no special object in reading,"" she said, ""when you can hear a bright man talk!"" He turned and stared for a second from the Young Electrician's embarrassed grin to the Youngish Girl.. ""Oh, dear me!"" said the Youngish Girl, with unmistakable sincerity. ""I'm afraid you haven't learned anything at all from me!"" ""Oh, yes, I have too!"" cried the Traveling Salesman, his whole round face lighting up suddenly with real pleasure. ""And I'll bet you a hundred dollars that you're a good deal more of a 'lady'. ""I'll bet you've met the Governor-General at least once in your life,"" said the Traveling Salesman. ""He dined at my house with me a week ago yesterday."" ""And I'll bet, most of anything, that you're haughtier than. ""All our kind of folks are playmates to you, and you take us as easy and pleasant as you'd slide down on the floor and play with any other kind of a kid,"" he says. ""Would you think it awfully impertinent of me if I asked you how you do your hair like that?"" he asks. ""Surer than smoke, after I get home and supper is over and the dishes are washed and I've just got. The Traveling Salesman asked, ""How did that lady in the train do her hair?"" The Youngish Girl explained: ""It's just three puffs, and two curls, and then a twist."" ""Oh, I hope I ain't been too familiar,"" he added, with sudden contriteness. ""Maybe I ought to have introduced myself first. I'm a drummer for Sayles & Say. ""I own the block that the Emporium is in,"" she said. ""Gee!"" said the Traveling Salesman. ""Oh, gee! Now I know I talk too much!"" ""My father owned a store in Malden, once,"" he stammered, just a trifle wistfully, ""but it burnt down, and there wasn't any insurance. The Youngish Girl snuggled up to her father's side. He reached out and unfastened the collar of her overcoat. She smiled back and said: ""She's all right here"" The Youngish girl then fell asleep. She was not the only one who fell asleep in the car. The car was full of people who had fallen asleep.. The Young Electrician's eyebrows lifted in astonishment. ""Sure they're boys!"" he said. ""Why, of course!"" The Traveling Salesman looked out far away through the window and whistled a long, breathy whistle. ""How in the deuce are you ever going to take care of 'em?"" he asked"

He wished her good evening in tones that were silvery, but seemed tainted by something unnatural. She felt her hair rise as if drawn by a shivery wind. He did kill her. His affair that night was prosy.. Nag Hong Fah walked over to the other end of Pell Street and entered a liquor-store which belonged to the Chin Sor Company. It was the gathering-place for the Chinese-born members of the Nag family, and there he occupied a seat of honor because of his wealth and charity and stout rectitude. He talked for about half an hour with the other members of his clan, sipping frag. The murder of Señora Garcia meant no sin to him. It was to him a simple action, respectable, even worthy. To regret, you must find sin in your heart. The Elevated roars above. The tale is of the Orient. There is about it an atmosphere of age-green bronze; of first-chop chandoo and spicy aloe-wood; of gilt, carved statues brought out of India when Confucius was young.. The story of a Chinese man's marriage to a white woman is told from a Chinaman's point of view. The story is told in the form of a letter written by the Chinese woman to her husband. The letter is titled: ""Fanny Mei Hi"" and is written by Fanny Mei, a Chinese woman who married a white man.. Nag Hong Fah invited the group to his flat in Grand Rapids, Wisconsin. The flat was furnished with a case of beer, a Bible, and a five-pound humidor of shredded tobacco. He told them to call him if they had any problems. The group left the flat with the promise to call again.. “You bet yer life, you fat old yellow sweetness!” agreed Fanny. “Say! Any time yer wanta lamp my wedding certificate—it’s hangin’ between the fottygraphs of the President and the Big Boss—all framed up swell!’” “Glad to have you—aren’t we, kid. Nag Hong Fah, who was a poet and a philosopher, said that she looked like a golden-haired goddess of evil, familiar with all the seven sins. He added that he did not mind her having seven, nor seventeen, nor seven times seventeen bundles of sin, as long as she kept them in the sacred bosom of the Nag family. “Purity is a jewel to the silly young. And you are old, honorable cousin,. Nag Sen Yat, the opium merchant, spoke to him of a certain Yung Quai. He said he was divorced from his younger brother, Nag Sen Yats, and that he was in love with a woman. Yats' older brother, Yung Long, the head of the. Nag Sen Yat warned Yung Long to stay away from Fanny Mei Hi. Yung Quai, Yung Sen Yats' ex-wife, is childless. Fanny was to bear Nag Sen Yato's sons. Nag SenYato proposed to Fanny, but she said no. He then married Yunglong. The story of the Sichuanese revolution is told.. “Sure! I’d rather be the wife of the fattest, yellowest Chink in. His own mother had been a river-girl, purchased during a drought for a handful of parched grain; and had died in the odor of sanctity. Fanny, on the other hand, though wickedly and lyingly insisting on her pure white blood, knew that a Chinaman is broad-minded and free-handed.. “I gotta have a dose of freedom. I’m an American—I’'m white—say!” “Sure,” he said. “You are free.”“An’ I�’ll play square—as long as you’re square,’’ she added under her breath.. The couple's first drink was a tumbler of Chinese rice whisky cut with Bourbon, and flavored with aniseed and powdered ginger.. Nag Hong Fah, seeing Yung Long crossing the street, extended a boisterous invitation to come up and have a drink. The talk dealt entirely with canned bamboo sprouts and preserved leeches, and pickled star-fruit, and brittle almond cakes. The Elevated structure pointed at the stars like a gigantic icicle stood on end, frozen, austere.. Yung Long knew that the restaurant proprietor was an audacious merchant who relied on long credits and future profits. He knew that in the past he had always granted ninety days’ leeway without question or special agreement. It was only after the price had been decided upon and duly sealed with the right phrases and palm touching palm that Yung Long remarked, very casually: “By the way, the terms are cash—spot cash. “Ah, I shall have a fine, large business to leave to the man-child which my wife shall bear me!’” “I shall leave it to. Fanny liked the last two best; chiefly the furs, which she wore through the whirling heat of an August day, as soon as she was strong enough to leave her couch. He also bestowed upon his wife a precious bracelet of cloudy white jade. “Getta hell outa here!” she admonished a red-powdered bricklayer who came staggering across the threshold of the back parlor. “Gettin’ the hell out of here.” She held fast. ""I ain’t! I ain't! I’m white—wottya mean callin’ me a Chink?” Mamie shrugged her shoulders. “All right for you, Fan, I guess,. Nag Hong Fah was happy in the realization of his fatherhood. The responsibilities of fatherhood had brought an added zest and tang to his keen, bartering Mongol brain. He had many a hard tussle with the rich Yung Long over the price of tea and rice and other staples, and never did either one of them mention the name of Yung Quai, nor that of the woman who had supplanted Yung Qai in the restaurant. “Nor ain’t. She laughed her happiness through the spiced, warm mazes of Chinatown, her first-born cuddled to her breast. Life, after all, had been good to her, had brought her prosperity and satisfaction at the hands of a fat Chinaman, at the end of her fantastic, twisted, unclean youth. She felt herself drawn into the surge of that Mongol race which had given her nine-tenths of her blood. A year later, after Nag Hong Fah, in expectation of the happy event, had acquired an option on a restaurant farther up-town, so that the second son might not be slighted in favor of Brian, who was to inherit the Great Shanghai Chop Suey Palace. But when NagHong Fah came home that night, the nurse told him. Nag Hong Fah's wife noticed that her husband's new enterprise was swallowing all his cash. He loved her with a sort of slow, passive love. But this time there was no christening, no gorgeous magenta-lettered invitations sent to the chosen. There were no precious presents of green jade and white jade heaped on the couch of the young mother.. Fanny sat up straight, clutching little Fanny to her. “Wottya mean—gave it up?” “You mean you gave it up—because—becauselittle Fanny is—a goil?’ “To be sure! A girl is fit only to bear children. Nag Hong Fah's wife, Fanny, had given birth to a baby girl. He dismissed it as a regrettable accident. He said it in his mellow, precise English. He had learned it at a night-school, where he had been the pride and honor of his class. Fanny had risen. She approached her husband, the baby held close to her heart with her left hand.. The Chinese blood in her veins—shrewd, patient—scotched the violence of her American passion. She controlled herself. She was fighting for her daughter, fighting for the drop of white blood in Her veins. It would not do to lose her temper. She said, “Looka here, Chinkie-Toodles,” she said. “You call yerself a. “All has been settled,” he replied. “Most satisfactorily settled!” He turned to go. But she rushed up to him. She clutched his sleeve.. “Yer damned, yellow, stinkin’ Chink! Yer—yer—Wotty. “I ain’t! I’m white—an’ square—an' decent’ —” “Ah!” he said. “You are a—ah—a Chink. Yung Long passed her house. He heard, looked up, and greeted her courteously, as was his wont. But this time he did not go straight on his way. He looked at her for several seconds, taking in the soft lines of her neck and shoulders, the small, pale oval of her face with the crimson of her broad, generous mouth, the white flash of her small, even teeth, and the blue, somb. She returned his gaze. With the light of the lamp shining in. Fanny's lips formed the thought into words: “Swell looker!” She said it in a headlong and vehement whisper that drifted down. Yung Long smiled, raised his neat bowler hat, and went on his way.. “I’m not sure why I’ve got so much to say about this,” says the man who was once called “The Great and Powerful’. “It’s a bit of a long story,’ he adds, “but I�’ll tell you what I mean.. Nag Hong Fah gave Fanny a severe beating and repeated the performance every night for a week until she subsided. “Give her a good old hiding, an’ she’ll feed outa yer hand. Nag Hong Fah's wife bought him a bracelet out of her savings. He gave it to her as a gift. She said it was just imitation gold and diamonds. He said he would give her a real bracelet if she had another son. She was delighted with the gift. He was delighted to have a son. He told her: “I shall give you a realbracelet,. Brian Neill, whom he chanced to meet one afternoon in Señora Garcia’s second-hand emporium, told him it was all right. “That beatin’ ye gave her didn’t do her any harm, me beloved nephew,” he said. � “She�s square. God help the lad who tries to pass. Nag Hong Fah, being a Chinaman, would mantle such small shortcomings with the wide charity of his personal laxity. “Faith, she’s square! Sits there with her little glass o’ gin an’ her auld chum, Mam. When late one night that winter, a high wind booming from the north and washing the snow-dusted Pell Street houses with its cutting blast, Fanny came home with a jag, a chill, and a hacking cough, and went down with pneumonia seven hours later. Nag Hong Fah was genuinely sorry. A child’s devotion is best stimulated by gratitude. And little Fanny shall be grateful to you. For she will go to a good. “Say! How much did yer say this here bracelet’s worth?” “Perhaps twenty-one. Do not worry,” he suggested. “I know a dealer of such trifles in. Fanny burst into laughter, gurgling laughter that shook her body, choked her throat, and leaped out in a stream of blood"

""Go home to your withered beldame of a wife and pray with her before the altar of unborn children"". Madusadan, captain of horse, was ten years the king's senior. Men disliked him because they could not beat him in joust or tournament. Women feared him because the purity of his life was an open book. For your sake I would sin the many sins. For the sake of one of your precious eyelashes I would spit on the names of the gods and slaughter the holy cow. You. ""My love for you is as the soft sweetness of wild honey which the bees of the forest have gathered among the perfumed asoka flowers,"" he said.

0.86,0.96,56.16970421272781,"Stuart McGregor's obsession of horror, of a certain grim expectancy, every time he recalled that final scene, just before Farragut Hutchison disappeared in the African jungle. The whole scene seemed unreal, almost oppressively, ludicrously theatrical, he says. McGregor: 'As he reconstructed it, the whole scene seems unreal,. He had seen many such drums, made from fire-hollowed palm trees and covered with tightly stretched skin. He remembered it all. The pall of sodden, stygian darkness all around; the night sounds of soft-winged, obscene things flapping lazily overhead. The chirp and whistle of innumerable monkeys; a warthog breaking through the undergrowth with a clumsy, clownish crash. The staccato thumping of a signal drum, and more faintly yet the answer from the next in line in line. He had seen them all. Yes. Yes, he had seen it all, and he remembered it.. He remembered the night jungle creeping in on their camp like a sentient, malign being. He recalled the occasion when Farragut Hutchison had had himself tattooed. He remembered the half-caste Swahili dancing girl who looked like a golden madonna of evil, familiar with all the seven sins. Doubtless the girl had gone shares with the Levantine craftsman who had done the work. But fear had followed them, stalked them, trailed them; a fear different from any they had ever experienced before. They had never been able to escape it. It was a terrible, terrible fear. They were going to be killed. It had to be stopped. They would have to kill each other.. The story of a group of adventure-seeking djinni in the wilds of the world. They followed the path of life from Nome to Timbuktu, from Peru to Outer Mongolia, from the Australian bush, to the absinth-sodden apache haunts of Paris. The story of their life was crimson and twisted and fantastic, and they had. Everything had seemed to mock them. They had longed for human companionship—white companionship. They feared their own camp fire. It had seemed completely isolated in the purple night. They longed to be with white faces. White slang, White curses. White odors. White faces.White slang. White curse words. White language. White  slang, white curses. They longed to be with white face. White  slang, White curse words, White faces, White language, White slang and White curses. They wanted to be with white face and white loyalty. They sought white. Stuart McGregor wrote a poem about the African jungle. He recalls the fear of death as pregnant with unmentionable horror. The African jungle would have welcomed a decent, square, honest white murder, he writes. McGregor's poem is called ""The Three Stars of Africa"" and is published by Simon & Schuster at £16.99.

The three stars of Africa, by Stuart McGregor, is published at £15.99, and is available on Amazon.. “The star of violence! The star of lust! And the little stinking star of greed!” he had broken into staccato laughter. “Shut your trap, you——” “ shut your trap.’ “ “shut your trap!’”“Shut up!“ ‘Shut up.”. The diamonds were good, could be sold at a big figure; and, even split in two, would mean a comfortable stake. Farragut Hutchison should be that one. Stuart McGregor used to say, with that rather plaintive, monotonous drawl of his, that the end of this phantasmal African adventure had been different from what he had expected it to be. He had found it disappointing. Not that it had lacked in purely dramatic thrills and blood-curdling trimmings. That wasn't it. On the contrary, it had had a plethora. Bakoto warriors had come from nowhere, out of the jungle, hundreds of them, silent, as if the wilderness had spewed them forth, it had seemed quite prosy. Prosy, too, had been the expectation of death. It had even seemed a welcome relief from the straining fatigues. Stuart McGregor used to say, “An explosion of life and hatred,” that’s what I had expected,’ he used to says. And it wasn’t. And the end came—slow and inevitable. Solid. Greek in a way.. The leader of the Bakotos, a tall, broad, frizzy, odorous warrior, had bowed before them with a great clanking of barbarous ornaments. Stuart McGregor had stammered ineffectual, foolish apologies: “We—we were drunk. We didn’t know what—oh—what we–” “What you were doing!” the Bakoto had finished the sentence for him. “My heart is heavy at the thought, white chiefs,” he said. � “But—you must pay!’. “Forgiveness in my heart, not the juju’s,” gently continued the negro. “The choice will be yours. Choice which one of you will die.” The Bakoto had smiled, with the same suave courtliness which had, somehow, increased the utter horror of the scene. � “Die—oh—a slow death, befitting the insult to the ju ju.’” “And there is forgiveness inMy heart——”“You—you mean to say —” Farragut Hutchison had jumped up, with extended hand,. Stuart McGregor had understood that there would be no arguing, no bargaining whatsoever. The Bakoto had finished the interrupted question with gentle, gliding, inhuman laughter. He had paused; then had continued gently, so very, very gently: “Yes. A slow death, depending entirely upon the vitality of the one of you two who will be sacrificed to the juju’s great holiness!” He had yawned and said, “There will be little knives. There will be the flying insects which follow the smell of blood and festering flesh. Too, there will be many, crimson-headed ants, many, ants—and a thin river of honey to show them the trail.”. ""Consider. The juju is just. He only wants the sacrifice of one of you, and you yourselves must decide which one shall go,"" he said. ""Be pleased to remember the many ants which follow the. Stuart McGregor had known that it was Farragut Hutchison who would be sacrificed to the juju. He had laughed and had thrown a greasy pack of playing cards into the circle of meager, indifferent light. “Let the cards decide, old boy,” he had shouted. ‘I shall return shortly and hear your choice.’ He had bowed and, with his silent warriors, had stepped back into the jungle that had closed behind them like a curtain. The Bakoto had committed a refined cruelty worthy of a more civilized race, and had added a psychic torture fully as dreadful as the physical torture of the little knives. The choice had been made for them. The decision had been theirs. They had chosen.. Stuart McGregor had shuffled, slowly, mechanically. It had seemed to him as if his brain was frantically telegraphing to his fingers. Had he done it on purpose? He did not know then. He never found out. But there were the little knives. He lived through the scene a thousand times. He had seen that his thumb and second finger had shuffling the ace of hearts to the bottom of the deck. He was not surprised. But he was shocked. He thought he had done it. And he had kept on shuffling. He did it onpurpose. He knew he had. He didn't know. But, in his memory, he lived through it a thousand years later.. Farragut Hutchison had been a professional faro dealer at Silver City. He remembered the sweat pouring from Stuart McGregor’s face. “Cut, won’t you?” he had said, his voice coming as if from very far away. The other had waved a trembling hand “No, no!” Deal ‘em as they lie. You won”t cheat me’ “Deal, man, deal! You’re driving me crazy. Get it over with.” “I’m going to die,” said Farragutt. ‘. He remembered how the dead leaves had stirred with a dry, rasping, tragic sound. He remembered how something slimy and phosphorous-green had squirmed through the tufted jungle grass. He had dealt.Mechanically, even as he was watching, them, his fingers had. Farragut Hutchison choked on his own shriek of joy and triumph. The Bakoto chief had stepped out of the jungle, followed by half a dozen warriors. Hutchison’s weak, ridiculous exclamation—ridiculous considering the dreadful fate that waited him: “Geewhittaker! You’. Stuart McGregor recalls the final scene of Farragut Hutchison's murder. He recalls the leering, evil wink in the eagle’s eye as Hutchison twitched his shoulder blades with absurd, nervous resignation. McGregor remembers the moment Hutchison told him he had cheated on his wife. McGregor recalls Hutchison’S mocking bravado: “Of course I cheated!” he said. “What would you have done, padre?” “I don’t know,” the priest replied. ‘I don't know, I don�’ he replied.. Father O’Donnell: “You would have done what I did. Yon wouldn’t have been able to help yourself.” Then, in a low voice: ‘And you would have paid! As I pay—every day, every minute, every second of my life.’ “Fear of what?” asked Father O'Donnell. “ fear of Farragut Hutchison—who is dead!” Ten years ago! The priest was speaking to the son of a British trader.. Stuart McGregor feared Farragut Hutchison who was dead. He did not believe that the man was dead, could not believe it. “And even suppose he’s dead,” he used. to say to the priest, “he’ll get me.” “I saw it in the eye of that eagle— the squinting eye ofThat infernal, tattooed eagle!” Then he would turn a grayish yellow, his whole body would tremble with a terrible palsy and, in a sort of whine, which was both ridiculous and pathetic, given his size and bulk, given the crimson, twisted adventures through which he had passed, he would exclaim: “He’d get me”. Stuart McGregor's sitting room is decorated with jungle curios, sjamboks and. assegais. He also has a wall of knobkerries and rhino shields. McGregor's room is filled with a shimmering, cruel mass of jungle Curios. He. Stuart McGregor was a well-known figure in the row of antique stores in back of Madison Square Garden. He specialized in African curios, and would send them to his home in New York. He was surprised to find a large, round package in his home. He opened it and found a rare African-themed book. The book was a gift to his son, who is now a New York City resident. He said: “I’m so happy to have this book. It’s a gift from my son.’’ The book is called ‘The African Book’ and is published by Simon & Schuster, priced $20.99. For more information on the book, visit www.stuart-mccormack.com.. Farragut was sent an African signal drum, covered with tightly stretched skin. In the center was a tattoo mark of an eagle in red and blue, surmounted by a lopsided crown, surrounded by a wavy design. He picked up the drum and clutched it to his heart with a cry of joy, and then he gave a scream of pain. He dropped the drum, fanned the air, and looked at the thing that had fastened itself to his right wrist. It seemed like a short length of rope, grayish in color, spotted with dull red. It was a short rope,grayish in colour, spotted by dull red, with a red and. A little, venomous snake, an African fer-delance, that had been curled up in the inside of the drum, been numbed by the cold, and had been revived by the splintering heat of New York.

The proceeding opened with a sermon pronounced by the Swamis.. The Swami gave a long speech on the duties of the twice-born. The assembly was politely bored, but the Swami enjoyed himself hugely. For it gave him an opportunity to show his great learning and his wonderful memory. Like most holy men, he loved to lay stress on the outward emblems of his faith. He told them that a Brahmin should not break up clods of. The author describes how the twice-born were making their names a name of scorn in the present world.

He was one of the first to die in the war, and was killed by the Taliban in the battle for control of the region. The battle was fought on the banks of the River Nangarhar, which runs through the heart of the valley of the same name. The Battle of the Nangaarhar was won by the Afghans, and the battle was the first time the Nangari had been involved in a major battle.. There was peace with the Suni Pathans who squatted on the upland pastures and so he had left his rifle at home, carrying only a broad-bladed dagger. He was glad of it, for a rifle meant weight, weight in the hills meant lack of speed, and speed was essential. He kept up a steady clip, averaging well over five miles an hour, up-hill or down. He would have been killed if he had been seen by the Sunis.. Mortazu Khan was on his way to his wife's village in Ghuzni. His wife had moaned terribly, and the village wise-woman had told him that he needed the English hakim's skill before the day was out if he wanted his wife to live. The Englishman was impatient, and asked, ""Why haven't you come sooner?"" Khan replied that his wife was a stout hill woman who had borne children before this; also that he had called in thewise-woman. ""She gave her fish sherbet to cool her blood. She put leeches on her chest,"" Khan said. ""What did she do?"". Mortazu Khan imagined the scene as Azeena's furious bellow. She wrote a Koran verse on a piece of paper, lit it, and held it smoking under his nose. He increased his speed as he reached the edge of the slope where it flattened to a rock-studded plateau. He bent and picked one to put in his turban for good luck. He smelled a familiar odor and saw two small, reddish eyes glaring at him from a clump of thorny wild acacia. He stood quite still. He would make her eat stick and force her to give back the money. He shrugged his shoulders.. Mortazu Khan heard the animal give tongue, a low, flat rumble growing steadily into a sustained roar. Instinctively he fingered across his left shoulder for the rifle—which was not there. At this time of the year the blue-gray, bristly haired mountain bears were not dangerous. They were busy filling their sagging bellies with prangus leaves and mulberries against the lean season. He would leave the bear alone, he decided, and the bear would leave him alone. He jumped sideways like a cat, cleared a heap of dry twigs, and made straight for a stout fir-. Mortazu Khan was attacked by a bear while climbing a fir. The bear was carried away by the hillman's weight and impetus and landed on a bed of ochre moss. Khan was able to climb back to the top of the fir and continue his climb. He wrote a book about the experience called ""The Bear and the Hillman"" The book was published by Oxford University Press in 2007. It is available in English and French. For more information on the book, visit the website.. ""Waughrrrr-yi-yi!"" said the bear, very low in her throat and with a certain hurt, childish intonation. ""Ahi! Pig, and Parent of Piglings!"" shouted Mortazu Khan, as he rapidly made the half-circle around the tree to the opposite side. ""Pig!"" repeated the hillman, wiping the sweat from his forehead, while the bear wrinkled her ugly, thin-skinned nose where the warm blood was trickling down into her open mouth.. Mortazu Khan and a bear were fighting in the woods. Khan was the more agile of the two. The bear could not make short turns in a whizzing, flying half-circle. The man, keeping tight to the fir, got ahead of her, while the bear, squealing like an angry boar, landed on the ground, hurting her delicate nose and clawing with her paws till the moss was shredded to rags and the sand beneath seemed to look up with scared, yellow eyes. Little stones clattered mockingly. Somewhere from the higher branches a noise trembled—a gurgling, throaty noise.. The bear's little, narrow-lidded eyes glowed like charcoal balls. Doubtless the cry of a buvra kurra, a black tree grouse, thought the hillman. The hair along her back was thick and taut, her ears flat. There was something ludicrous in her appearance, too—something which spoke of iron, sinister resolution. She tried to learn from Mortazu Khan, tried to whiz her bulk in shorter circles, to charge straight at her foe.. Mortazu Khan was chased by a bear. The bear missed him by less than a foot. The man's hands were hot and raw. His heart was cold with fear. For back across the hills was the mother of his sons. He cursed again the little bird which gurgled in the branches. He could not see it. But the gurgle was becoming loud, insistent, blending curiously and malignantly with the bear's wicked bellow. He was dancing on the naked ground. One of his sandals had split the heel-rope and had flown away.. Mortazu Khan tried to kill Bibi Bear with his bare hands. He could throw the dagger, but what then? One does not kill a mountain bear with a single thrust of steel. So he kept whizzing around the tree, and his thoughts whizzed along, his fears, his hopes. And then, quite suddenly, the bear changed her tactics. She rose on her hind feet, fir needles and moss sticking to her pelt, belly sagging loosely, perspiration rising from her nostrils in a gray flag of steam.. Mortazu Khan knew it, too. His skin seemed to shrink. Blue wheels whirled in front of his eyes. A hammer beat at the base of his skull. There was Azeena—who would not live out the day unless he killed her. ""Allah!"" he said. ""It is not I who shall be a widower to-night, but Azeena who will be a widow!"" ""Waughree!"" replied the bear. ""Base-born and lean bastard!"". Mortazu Khan was fighting a bear. He had to reach Ghuzni, the doctor, and back yonder Azeena was dying. He brought down the point with speed and ferocity, straight into the brute's right eye. The bear, crazed with pain, jumped high in the air like a rubber ball, came down again, roaring, squealing, bellowing, slid lumberingly to the left. But this time it was another. Mortazu Khan's son was dying before he was born. Azeena was dying hard. And back beyond the bracken-clad slope, his son was dieing. The peaks of the Gul Koh flushed gold and lavender. Far on the edge of the horizon, the peaks of Gul Koh were flushed gold, lavender, and the sky was blue. The bear snorted. The Khan ran away. He did not jump. He seemed to stream, to flow,. The man was tired and sleepy. His right hand felt paralyzed, but still it gripped the dagger. He knew that the end was near, knew that he himself must hasten it. He must face Bibi Bear—face her in the open—and kill or be killed. For back yonder was Azeena, and the minutes were slipping by like water. ""Allah!"" he mumbled, ""Allah! Allah! Allah!"" he said. ""I will kill her, I will kill the bear."" ""I have to kill her,"" he said, ""or I will die."". Mortazu Khan heard the bird's cry: ""Wheet-wheet!"" He looked up and saw a little bear cub had dropped to a branch. Mortazu knew why Bibi Bear had broken the truce of the fat season. He stepped away from the protecting tree, deliberately to give battle in the open. The bear followed, growling and growling. He was fighting for his wife, his unborn son, and he said to himself that the bear, too, wasFighting for the young of her body, for the thing which gave meaning to life. He said:. The man leaped first, straight into the bear's embrace, the point of his dagger ahead of him like a guidon. With every ounce of bunched strength and despair, and as the bear, in mortal agony, realized her steely grip, he struck. But there was no hatred in the blows. ""Ahi! Poor Bibi Bear! Brave Bibi Bears!"" he sobbed. ""Brave Bibi bears!"" he cried. ""Bibi bears! Brave bears!"" The bear fell to the ground and curled up like a sleeping dog. The man stood up and said, ""I'm going to finish the fight."". Mortazu Khan was walking across the plateau when he saw the cub. He reached up and caught the toddling, fluffy cub. ""Come, little Sheik Bear!"" he crooned as he might to a frightened child. ""There is room for thee in the house of Mortazu. Khan!"" He walked toward the flat roofs of Ghuzni, leaving behind him a thin trail of blood, but hurrying, hurrying. The English hakim would have two patients instead of one, he told himself, and, dizzy, a little depressed."

He would say, for example, a razor-strop or a box of talc powder. Now, he says, the petty, negligible ones are almost integrally part of one’s self, like one�'s eyes, or ears, or nose.. The writer says that the tragedy of the whole thing was that it was so ludicrous, straight through the back of the beyond. He says that it is vital not from a pathological angle, because you always want what you can’t get, but really, truly, physically physically physically. Tragic! Although—not—because it wasSo ludicrous! Although —not —because it is so ludicrous. Although it was. Although— not—because it was so. ludicrous, but because it was straight through. straight through through. It was that which meant. ""I was quite out of my head when that fellow from the Angom Presbyterian Mission picked me up. Doctor Sylvester Morrison, an Englishman, and a very decent chap. Sat there screeching some musical-comedy song of a few years back"" ""Gee—but this is a lonesome town!” or something of the sort"". The author was on a river trip in South Africa when he encountered a pack of Fang coons. He says he was annoyed that the animals had run away, and that he had used his last cartridge. The story of his encounter with the coons is told in a book called ""The Ogowe River: An African Adventure"" The book is published by Simon & Schuster, priced £16.99. To order a copy of the book, call the Mail Online newsdesk on 08457 90 90 90 or visit www.mailonline.co.uk.. The author was on a canoe trip through the French Congo. He was not afraid of being alone, but of being out in the wilderness alone. The author was not an adventurer, nor was he a soldier or a guide. He knew the area better than he knew his native Cape Cod. He is not afraid to be out in nature alone, even if it is in the middle of the jungle. He has always been friends with the bush. He says he is not a greenhorn, but a dyed-in-the-wool Africander.. ""I am a businessman, pure and simple, and I needed the natives to bring me rubber and ivory and gold-dust,"" he says. ""I did ‘em brown whenever I had half a chance, and they returned the compliment,"" he adds. ""So we had mutual respect for each other, andI wasn’t scared of them—not the slightest bit,"" he writes. ""They might have helped themselves to some of my other packs as easy as pie. But they had not. Why? God only knows."" ""I am not a man of any kind, but I am a man who has a sense of humor. The author was in the heart of Africa when he was attacked by a group of negroes. He says he had a good laugh at their expense, but didn't laugh much a few days later. He decided that he would just drift along down the Ogowe River to the estuary, and no hurry. He was well supplied with everything a fellow needs in the wilderness, from quinine to matches, from tabloid beef to—oh, tabloid fish cakes. The author was eventually rescued by a passing canoe.. The Ogowe is not a treacherous water; the channel is clearly marked most of the way, and the mangroves sit rather well back. There weren't any women kicking around loose in that part of the Dark Continent to care or fuss if my hair was long. ""I was quite cheerful—for a few seconds, perhaps minutes. Blessed relief, in fact, to be independent of one’s outer man, I thought. But almost immediately, I sensed that vague, crushing presentiment of coming disaster"" ""I tried to crystallize my nervous presentiment. Couldn’t, though. It was too subtle, too elusive. ""I used to brood on that thought until often, in my dreams, I felt like taking Africa by the throat and throttling it as I would an enemy,"" he says. ""I had a sort of half-feeling ... that Africa was not a continent, but ... a being, a sinister, hateful, cruel, brooding monster"". The author was in Africa for the benefit of his bank-account and the encouragement of his creditors. He had a fever and decided to take a dip in the Ogowe River. The moment his paddle fanned the water, he reconsidered, subconsciously, that he was in no hurry. He then decided to go ahead and paddle the river slowly, as he had intended.. ""I wanted to be shut for a while from this stinking, brooding, leering Africa,"" he writes. ""I decided, again subconsciously, that I was in a devil of a hurry, that he must get away from the hinterland, from the Congo"" ""I said to myself that, arrived at the coast, I would catch the first mail-boat bound for Liverpool and then on to America"". ""I wanted America, the white man’s land,"" says the author. ""I paddled as if all the furies were after me,"" he adds. ""And then I looked about me and I saw Africa, putrid, acrid! And, gee! How I hated it—hated it! I pulled myself together. Back to the paddle with all my strength"" ""I wanted to be a woman, as if it were a woman,"" he says.. Three days. Just opened a tin at random, sneaked forty winks now and then, and off again, though my hands were raw and blistered, my back sore and strained till I nearly shrieked, my legs numb from the knees down, my eyes red-rimmed and smarting with watching the current. The sixth day, I fell in a faint. Picked myself up again, rescued my paddle that was about to float away downstream, swallowed an opium pill, and called myself a fool. At all events, I was off again. But I felt weak.. The author was afraid of himself, he writes. He was in a swamp, and the swamp was full of thorny plants. The plants were trying to rip the heart out of his body, he says. The swamp was a terrible place, but he didn't care. He felt a sickening sensation of nameless horror.. The author was canoeing through the Ogowe River in South Africa. He lost track of time, and by the tenth day had reached the coast. He feared that he would never reach home. The loneliness he felt lay across his heart, soul, and body like a sodden blanket. The hatred of Africa, it nearly choked him! And the loneliness! The loneliness which lay across my heart, my soul, my body, and the fear that I would never reached home. It was at the very least the 10th day, and still my paddle went, still the river slid before my eyes.. The author was canoeing through the jungle when he lost sight of the shore. The jungle closed in on him, closing in on his canoe. The author was left blind and unable to see as the sun went down. The book is published by Simon & Schuster, priced £16.99.

The author recalls a sudden glimpse of jungle natives. The natives were ""dwarfs, you know, the useless African tatters of a pre-Adamite breed"" The natives ""bl blended into the jungle, like brown splotches of moss on the brown, furry tree-trunks"" The author recalls shouting for help, but his voice seemed to come across illimitable distances. The next thing he remembers is that he shivered all over as if in an ague, that cold sweat was running down his face, that he groped for the quinine and could not find it.. ""I knew that I was dying. Straight through my delirium, I realized it. Realized, too, that only one thing would help me to cheat death: a sound roof over my head, sound flooring under my feet, sound walls about"" ""It was not a hallucination, an optical illusion, a mirage. It was real. Solid stone and wood and corrugated iron and a chimney and windows and doors all complete, like a bit of suburbia dropped in the jungle"" ""I might as well have wished for the moon!. The house was found on a knoll due north, perhaps a quarter of a mile away from the river. It had been built by a West Coast trader on a yearly trip to the Congo. The house was built in the 1950s by a group of wealthy Londoners. It was built on a site that was once the site of a large-scale slave trade in the area. It is now a popular tourist attraction in the French Congo, with a population of around 100,000. The home is now owned by a British couple, who have a son and a daughter, who live there.. The author's younger son built a house for himself. The house was built; he moved in, and three weeks later some flying horror bit him in the thumb, and he promptly kicked the bucket. ""Gaboon, Limited,” they called the new company, with laconic pride, and for some reason—the usual, you know, social stuff, Mayfair and Belgravia flirting with Lombard and Threadneedle streets,"" he says. ""It was the sort of house our younger son building for himself,"" he adds. ""Darn the expense! He was stubborn if nothing else"". The writer was in Westchester-in-the-Congo when he saw the house. He says he ran for it, running, stumbling, soaked to the skin. The natives must have considered it “bad ju-ju,” for they left it severely alone. ""I pushed open the door, and, at once, I became conscious of a terrible, overpowering fear,"" he says.. ""I felt that ghastly, unknown, invisible enemy of mine the moment I was beyond the threshold. At first he was shrouded, ambiguous. Hidden somewhere in the great, square entrance hall and peeping in upon my mind, my sanity"" ""I will defend myself to the last drop of my blood!” Quite melodramatic, eh? Incredibly, garishly so, like a good old Second Avenue five-acter where the hero is tied to the stake.. The author was trying to get dry after a fight with an unknown, invisible enemy. He says he felt the wind of his enemy blow over his face, neck, hands, chest, legs, like a breath of icy wind. He ran away, shrieking at the top of his lungs, peering into every corner, revolver in his right hand, finger on trigger, ready to fight, fight to death. If only he would only come out into the open, he says.. ""I decided to use a stratagem. I decided to stand quite still, then to turn with utter suddenness and take him by surprise,"" he said. ""Come out here and show your face, and fight like a man!” he added. ""And I laughed, derisively, to get his goat,"" he added, ""and then I could hear his answering laughter, coming in staccato, high-pitched bursts"". ""I'll get you, you dirty coward, I’ll get you! Oh, I'll getYou and kill you!"" ""I could hear his footsteps pattering away through one of the farther rooms, and, too, his maniacal, staccato laughter"" ""Oh, how I hated him, hated him! And I ran after him, through room after room, shouting: ""I’m going to get you!"". His face was a mass of scars and bleeding scratches and cuts; and in his right hand he held a revolver—leveled straight at my heart. He fired first, and there was an enormous crash, and he fired into a mirror, a big mirror."
0.64,0.74,55.071461502996776,"The West has produced many types of vagabond,--it might be excusable to say, won them from every condition of society. The ease and apparent willingness with which some men revert to an aimless life can best be accounted for by the savage or barbarian instincts of our natures. There was something in the primitive West of a generation or more ago which satisfied them. Nowhere else could it be found, and once they adapted themselves to existing conditions, they were loath to return to former associations. The vagabonds of the West are a breed that have been around for a very long time.. The elder Wells some years previously had become interested in western and southern real estate, and among other investments which he had made was the purchase of an old Spanish land grant on a stream called the Salado. These land grants were made by the crown of Spain to favorite subjects. They were known by name, which they always retained when changing ownership. The elder Wells had a longing to see other sections of the country. He had a long love for Texas, and was a great admirer of the state. He died in Texas in 1883, and is buried in San Antonio, Texas. He is survived by his wife, three children, and two grandchildren.. Wells, junior, expressed a desire to visit this family possession, and possibly spend a winter in its warm climate. This decision was more easily reached from the fact that there was an abundance of game on the land. His route, both by water and rail, brought him only within eighty miles of his destination, and the rest of the distance he was obliged to travel by stage. There was much to be seen which was new and attractive to the young Easterner, and he tarried in it several days. The arrival and departure of the various stage lines for the accommodation of travelers like himself was of more than passing interest to him. He enjoyed its novel and picturesque scenery.. The Chihuahua wagon was drawn sometimes by twelve, sometimes by twenty mules, four abreast in the swing. The freight trains, the motive power of which was mules and oxen, were sometimes late from El Paso, six hundred miles to the westward. Frequently they carried guards, whose presence was generally sufficient to command the respect of the average robber. Many a Chihuahsua wagon carried three or four tons of gold and silver, generally the latter. Here was a new book for this college lad, one he had never studied, though it was more interesting to him than some he had read. He had never read a book like this.. Wells overheard a conversation in a frontier village. He liked it. The romance was real; it was not an imitation. People answered his few questions and asked none in return. Here were characters worthy of a passing glance. He prepared for his final destination, the U.S. State of New Mexico. He was to become the first American to be born in the state in 1846. He died in 1869, leaving behind a wife and three children. He is survived by his wife, three children, and his wife's parents. He also leaves behind a son, a daughter, a son-in-law, and a daughter-in law.. The two men set out on horseback to find their father's property. The property was less than twenty miles from San Antonio. There were several small ranchitos on the tract, where five or six Mexican families lived. The pecan crop which grew along the creek bottoms was beginning to have a value in the coast towns for shipment to northern markets. All kinds of game was in abundance, including waterfowl in winter, though winter here was only such in name. They offered no apology for their presence on this land, nor was such in order, for it was the custom of the country.. The Americanos considered themselves honored when they learned that he was the son of the owner of the grant. They merely referred to themselves as ""his people,"" as though belonging to the land. The food offered was something new, but the relish with which his companion partook of it assisted young Wells in overcoming his scruples. He ate a supper of dishes he had never tasted before. The coffee he declared was delicious. The women of the ranchito brought other bedding, and a comfortable bed soon awaited the Americanos. They were given blankets, and the women brought other beds. The man's ideas of distance was what he could ride in a given number of days on a good pony.. The footsteps of a horse interrupted their conversation. Tiburcio, the hunter, was introduced to the two Americans with a profusion of politeness. There was nothing above the ordinary in the old hunter, except his hair, eyes, and swarthy complexion, which indicated his Aztec ancestry. He learned that deer were very plentiful everywhere, and that on this very tract of land were several wild turkey roosts. On the prairie portion of the surrounding country could be found large droves of antelope. In architecture, the jacal in which they sat satisfied his ideals. His ideas of wealth were no improvement over those of his Indian ancestors of a century previous.. Tiburcio counted a thousand antelope during a single morning. The javeline or peccary abounded in endless numbers, but it was necessary to hunt them with dogs. Many a native cur met his end hunting these animals, cut to pieces with their tusks. Even this was always done from horseback, as it was dangerous to approach the javelines. They would, when aroused, charge anything that came near them with a javelin. The old hunter showed the young man a new gun, explaining its good qualities through his interpreter. He asked for its price and asked for a description of the gun.. Wells engaged the old hunter's services for the following day. The two men shook hands and bade each other good-night, each using his own language to express the parting. The first link in a friendship not soon to be broken had been forged. The men rode off up the stream, and the pecans, they noticed, were already falling, as they passed through splendid groves of this timber. Tiburcio frequently called attention to fresh deer tracks near the creek bottom, and shortly afterward the first game of the day was sighted.. Tiburcio pointed out one particular grove lying three or four miles farther up the creek. Here he said was a cabin which had been built by a white man who had left it several years ago. Five or six does and grown fawns broke cover and ran a short distance, stopped, looked at the horsemen, and then capered away. Wells asked the old hunter if he were sure that this cabin was on and belonged to the grant. Being assured on both points, he then inquired if there was anything to hinder him from occupying the hut for a few months.. Tiburcio's cabin was built of logs and chinked with clay for mortar. The only Mexican feature it possessed was the thatched roof. While the Americans were examining it and its surroundings, Tiburcio unsaddled the horses, picketing one and hobbling the other two. He then prepared a lunch from some articles he had brought along. The meal, consisting of coffee, chipped venison, and a thin wafer bread made from corn and reheated over coals, was disposed of with relish. The two Americans sauntered around for some distance, and on their return to the cabin found Tibur. Tiburcio and his party were on their way back to the ranch. They came across a herd of antelope, which they found to be very beautiful. The pair decided to stay the night, and Tiburcios was asked to be their guide the next day. He agreed, and the pair set off for the ranch in the morning. The trip was a success, and they returned to the Ranch the following day. The party returned to their home in the ranch, where they stayed for the rest of the week. They also went on to visit other parts of the ranch and to the town of San Diego.. Wells and Tiburcio soon had several saddle ponies, and the old hunter adding his pack of javeline dogs. The pair were well equipped for the winter campaign. Wells was an artist in woodcraft as well as in his knowledge of the habits of animals and birds. The two Americans planned to return to the village in the morning for the needed supplies. Wells took the care of his gun, blankets, and several other articles until he should return. The young man was an apt scholar, was now the order of the day. To shoot from horseback lent a charm, yet made aim uncertain, nor was it advisable to get too close range. It was exciting sport to bring to bay a drove of these animals.. Tiburcio wrote regularly long letters home, but as it took Tiburcio a day to go to the post-office, he justified himself in putting off, sometimes several weeks, because it ruined a whole day and tired out a horse to mail a letter. They would saddle up in the evening and ride ten miles, sleeping out all night by a fire in order to stalk a buck at daybreak. They thought nothing of spending a whole night going from one turkey roost to another, if half a dozen fine birds were the reward. All surplus game was sent to the ranchito below, where it was always appreciated. Many a young dog made a fatal mistake in getting too near this little animal.. He wrote his father what splendid opportunities there were to engage in cattle ranching. He concluded by advising that they buy or start a brand of cattle on this grant. His father's reply was that he should expect his son to return as soon as the state of his health would permit. Following letters noted no improvement in his health. He wished to be a dutiful son, yet he wished to hunt just one more winter. He had acquired a sufficient knowledge of Spanish to get along now without an interpreter. He would ride into San Antonio for a day or two, but there was nothing new to be seen there.. Tiburcio's father wrote to his parents to ask if his son should return to Texas. The doctor advised him not to think of leaving Texas for at least another year. The son wrote that he hoped to be able to go home in the early spring. Any remorse of conscience he may have felt over the deception resorted to was soon forgotten. The antlered buck was again in his prime. His favorite range was carefully noted. Very few hunts were unrewarded by at least one or more shots at this noble animal. With an occasional visitor, the winter passed as had the previous one. Some congenial spirit would often spend a few days with them, and his departure was always regretted.. Alexander Wells was a trustworthy though unquoted authority in woodcraft. He could foretell the coming of a norther twenty-four hours in advance. Just which course deer would graze he could predict by the quarter of the wind. How he did these things he did not know himself. But finally the appearance of blades of grass and early flowers warned them that winter was gone and that spring was at hand. Their occupation, therefore, was at an end. Now how to satisfy the folks at home and get a further extension of time was the truant's supreme object. The truant had no desire to elevate the old hunter to his own standard. He preferred to sit at his feet.. The young hunter was enjoying life on the Salado, where questions of state and nation did not bother him. But rebellion was brewing, for he did not want to go East--not just yet. One day in the spring a conveyance drove up to the cabin, and an elderly, well-dressed woman alighted. On the appearance of a woman, the game instantly ceased. Recognition was mutual, but neither mother nor son spoke a word. It was the end of a happy existence for the young hunter, who was now forced to return to the mainland. The story was told in a book called ""The Adventures of a Young Hunter"" by William Makepeace Thackeray.. Alexander's mother asked him to come to San Antonio. He said he would go with her, but that he may never see her again. He returned to the cabin, made the necessary change, and stood before them a picture of health, bewhiskered and bronzed like a pirate. ""That lady is my mother,"" he said in good Spanish, though there was a huskiness in his voice, ""I may neversee you again. I don't think I will"" He then turned back, and taking the old black hands of Tiburcio in his own, said inGood Spanish,. ""You may have for your own everything I leave,"" said Wells to his mother. The son failed in two business enterprises in which his father started him. When the son had passed his thirtieth year, his parents became resigned and gave their consent to his return to Texas. But the voice of a siren, singing of flowery prairies and pecan groves on the Salado, filled every niche and corner of his heart and he balked at the marriage offer. ""I was not a man to be taken advantage of,"" said the son. ""If I had been, I would not have been able to leave my family."". The West won the son of a New York family. He left for Texas to start a cattle ranch. He told a friend that the social sacrifices he was making would be repaid by the freedom and advantages of the boundless West. The son later returned to New York to live with his parents. He died of a heart attack in 1916, at the age of 48. He was buried in New York. He is survived by his wife and three children. The family moved to Texas in 1858. The boy's father died in 1916. The father's son died in 1918 at age 48. The daughter died in 1922 at age 51."
0.49,0.59,44.74370112945265,"A man named Gray had settled in one of the northwest counties in Texas while it was yet the frontier. He had raised the brand of horses in question. The history of this man is somewhat obscured before his coming to Texas. But it was known and admitted that he was a bankrupt, on account of surety debts which he was compelled to pay for friends in his former home in Kentucky. Many a good man had made similar mistakes before him. The clash of opinions between these two eminent western authorities was short, determined, and to the point.. The sheriff either relied on his reputation as a bad man, or probably did not know any better. The exemption laws allowed only a certain number of gentle horses, and as any class of range horses had a cash value then, this brand of horses was levied on to satisfy the judgment. Still this stock was as liable to range in one county as another. The question of possession did not bother him. Still the horses were as liable as any other stock to range. The sheriff was not as wise as he should have been. The horses were running on an open range.. ""There was a time when the decisions of Judge Lynch in that State had the hearty approval of good men,"" says author. ""The effrontery of any man to deny his authority ... was a reflection on his record,"" he adds. ""There is one thing quite evident: the sheriff had overlooked the nature of this man Gray,"" adds author. 'He was no weakling, inclined to sit down and cry,' says author of ""The Wild West,"" published by Simon & Sch. The local papers in supporting his candidacy for this office had often spoken of him and his chief deputy as human bloodhounds. Ninde was resourceful if anything. He would overtake those horses, overpower the men if necessary, and bring back to his own bailiwick that brand of horse-stock. Of course Gray might object, but that would be a secondary matter. Having made one mistake, he would make another to right it.. The horses were kept under herd day and night in a near-by pasture. Gray usually herded by day, and two young men, one his son, herding by night. Things went on this way for a month before the horses were found. The horses were taken to the town of Ninde, Kansas. The sheriff sent his deputy to do the Sherlock act for him as soon as the horses are located. The deputy had no trouble in doing, as this sized bunch of horses could not well be hidden.. The deputy secretly engaged seven or eight bad men of the long-haired variety, such as in the early days usually graced the frontier towns with their presence. This brand of human cattle were not the disturbing element on the border line of civilization that writers of that period depicted, nor the authors of the bloodcurdling drama portrayed. A good big bluff was considered sufficient for the end in view. This crowd was mounted, armed to the teeth, and all was ready.. Ninde and his posse rode out about midnight to the pasture and found the herd and herders. All the heelers to the play now jumped their horses forward, holding their six-shooters over their heads, ratcheting the cylinders of their revolvers by cocking and lowering the hammers. ""If you want these horses that bad,"" said young Gray, ""I reckon you can get them for the present"". The sheriff paid no attention to the advice of young Gray, but when day broke he saw that he had more horses than he wanted. One of the men with Ninde knew of a corral where this work could be done, and to this corral, which was at least fifteen miles from the town where the rescue party of Gray had departed at daybreak. The pursuing posse soon took the trail of the horses from where they left the pasture, and as they headed back toward Texas, it was feared it might take a long, hard ride to overtake them.. The horses were carrying off with them horses that were the private property of men in the rescue party. The gait was now increased to the gallop, not fast, probably covering ten miles an hour, which was considered better time than the herd could make under any circumstances. Gray said to his party, ""Keep a short distance behind me. I'll open the ball, if there is any."" To the others of the party, it seemed that the supreme moment in the old man's life had come. Over his determined features there spread a smile of the deepest satisfaction, as though some great object in life was about. Gray rode up to within a hundred feet of Ninde's posse, and dismounting handed the reins of his bridle to his son. He advanced with a steady, even stride, a double-barreled shotgun held as though he expected to flush a partridge. At this critical juncture, his party following him up, it seemed that reputations as bad men were due to get action, or suffer a discount at the hands of heretofore peaceable men.. ""Do you realize what it will take to get them?"" asked Gray, as he brought his gun, both barrels at full cock, to his shoulder. ""Bat an eye, or crook your little finger if you dare, and I'll send your soul glimmering into eternity, if my own goes to hell for it,"" he said. ""What in hell are you doing with my horses?"". The old man said he would gladly die rather than suffer an injustice or quietly submit to what I felt was a wrong against me. Ninde was on the uneasy seat, for he would not return to the State, though his posse returned somewhat crestfallen. The party became communicative, as they all had a respect for the old man's feelings. The men of his party turned to follow Gray, who had remounted, and he presented a pitiful sight.. The sheriff's bondsmen, upon an examination into the facts in the case, concluded to stand a suit on the developments of some"

The grass was well forward, while the cattle had changed their shaggy winter coats to glossy suits of summer silk. The brands were as readable as an alphabet. We were to represent a range that had twelve thousand cattle on it, a total of forty-seven brands..

""Do you remember,"" said Babe, ""when I dissolved with the 'Ohio' outfit and bought in with the ""LX"" people?"" ""When you what?"" repeated Edwards. ""Well, then, when I was discharged by the ' Ohio's' and got a job ploughing fire-guards with. ""Have you ever been back in old San Saba since we left?"" inquired Edwards after a long meditative silence. ""Oh, yes, I spent a winter back there two years ago, though it was hard lines to enjoy yourself,"" replied Babe. ""You know that I was high card once with the eldest,"" said Edwards.. The old man was just common bog Irish all his life, until a cattle syndicate bought his lands and cattle for twice what they were worth. Then he blossomed into a capitalist. Get all you can and can all you get, took precedence and became the first law with your papa-in-law. It's wonderful what money can do! They moved to town, and have been to Europe since they left the ranch.. ""So you think I've lost my number, do you?"" commented Edwards, as he lay on his back and fondly patted a comfortable stomach. ""Well, possibly I have, but it's some consolation to remember that that very good woman that you're slandering used to give me the glad hand and cut the pie large when I called"". Bradshaw asked Edwards about Raneka Bill Hunter. Edwards said he had been discharged for hanging a horse. Bradshaw said he'd take a chance if he were present. He added: ""I may be out of the game, but I'd taking a chance yet if I were present"". ""How did he do it? Why, there was a big cottonwood grew on a bluff bank of the creek. He left the running noose on the horse's neck, climbed out on this overhanging limb, taking the rope through a fork directly over the water"" ""That settled his ever hurting any one. He was hung higher than Haman. Bill never went back to the camp, but struck out for other quarters"". ""Last winter when Bill was riding the chuck line, he ran up against a new experience. It seems that some newcomer bought a range over on Black Bear. This new man sought to set at defiance the customs of the range. It was currently reported that he had refused to invite people to stay for dinner, and preferred that no one would ask for a night's lodging.. ""Bill and his pardner moseyed in an opposite direction a short distance and held a parley. Bill sparred around the main question, but finally asked if it was too late to get dinner, and was very politely informed that dinner was over"" ""Bill was so nonplussed at the reception that it took him some little time to collect his thoughts. When it thoroughly dawned on him. ""They went back and dismounted about ten steps from the door. They shot every cartridge they both had, over a hundred between them"" ""Raneka made it a rule to go down and visit the Cheyennes every winter, sometimes staying a month"" ""He was perfectly at home with them, and they all liked him"". ""We fixed Bill up in fine shape, put feathers in his hair, streaked his face with red and yellow, and had him all togged out in buckskin, even to moccasins. As we entered the dining-room, George led him by the hand, assuring all the girls that he was perfectly harmless. Not a man would eat at the wagon; every one rode for the hotel.. ""He pushed back his chair about four feet, and stared at the girls like an idiot,"" writes Wall. ""That supper lasted an hour, and he ate enough to kill a horse"" ""He's a good Injun,"" says Wall, who apologized to the girls. ""He wants some more beef,' said Wall. 'Bring him some more Beef'. ""Seems like I remember that fellow Wall,"" said Bradshaw, meditating. ""Why, of course you do. Weren't you with us when we voted the bonds to the railroad company?"" asked Edwards. ""No, never heard of it; must have been after I left. What business did you have voting bonds?"". ""It was a great gathering. The hotels fed us, and the liveries cared for our horses,"" he said. ""Everything was as free as air, and we all understood that a new railroad was a good thing for the cattle interests"" ""We gave it not only our votes, but moral support likewise,"" he added.. ""There was an underestimate made on the amount of liquids required, for the town was dry about thirty minutes,"" he says. ""That was sufficient. George went into a store and cut off about fifty feet of new rope. Some fellows that knew how tied a hangman's knot"" ""That's how we got the money to build the bridge,"" he adds.. ""I tell you, sir, these bonds will pauperize unborn gener--' But the noose dropped over his neck, and cut short his argument. There were a hundred men around him and hanging on to the rope"" A druggist, whom most of them knew, burst through the crowd, and whipping out a knife. ""The druggist took him through his store, and up some back stairs"" ""He said: 'You're a stranger to me. I lied to those men, but I saved your life' "" ""I'll take you to the four-o'clock train, and get you out of this town"". ""There were over seven hundred votes cast, and only one against the bonds. How that one vote got in is yet a mystery"" ""There were no hard drinkers among the boys, all easy drinkers, men that never refused to drink"" ""I'll see you through this. I'll come up and see you every hour. Take things cool and easy now"". ""I bought a white shirt and went to the ball. If there was one shot fired that night, there were ten thousand"" ""I squeezed the hand of an alfalfa widow during a waltz, who instantly reported the affront offered to her"". ""The goods were all he claimed for them, and on our return he asked me as a personal favor to apologize to the lady, admitting that he was none too solid with her himself"" ""I did it on the grounds that I could not afford to have any difference, especially with a gentleman who would willingly risk his life for a lady who claimed his protection"". Bradshaw asked Edwards what had become of Patsy St. John, the fiddler. Edwards replied that he had closed his eyes when he died. Bradshaw tried to go home, but kept returning to questions about former acquaintances. He finally gave up and went back to the camp.. ""He was one of those little men you can't help but like; small physically, but with a heart as big as an ox's"" ""He lived about three years on the range, was welcome wherever he went, and never made an enemy or lost a friend. He couldn't; it wasn't in him. He changed his mind one morning, lost hope that he would ever get well, and died in three days"". The old horse stood like a kitten. Not a man pretended to notice, but we all saw him put his foot in the stirrup three different times and attempt to lift himself into the saddle. He simply lacked the strength. He asked one of the boys to unsaddle the horse, saying he wouldn't go with us. We all tried to jolly him, but each got the same answer from him, 'I'm going to die'. He asked Joe Box and Ham Rhodes, the two biggest men in the outfit, to sit one on each side of his cot until he went to sleep. He knew better than any of us how near he was to crossing. But it seemed he felt safe between these two giants. The third evening he seemed to rally, talked with us all, and asked if some of the boys would not. ""Large hands laid him down tenderly, but a fit of coughing came on. He struggled in a hemorrhage for a moment, and then crossed over to the waiting figures among the oleanders"" ""There stands--mother--now--under--the--oleanders. Who is--that with--her? Yes, I had--a sister. Open --the--windows. ""We took him next day about ten miles and buried him with those freighters who were killed when the Pawnees raided this country"" ""Some man will plant corn over their graves some day"""
0.23,0.33,23.63756832864005,"Texas Rangers were ordered to cross the Concho River. Eight hundred cattle had started west up the river. Their destination was believed to be New Mexico. Suspicion rested on them, as they had failed to take out inspection papers.. ""Dad Root"" was a man whom every man in our company would follow as though he had been our captain. He could resight a gun, shoe a horse, or empty a six-shooter into a tree from the back of a running horse with admirable accuracy.. ""We'll make it early to-day. I know a fine camping spot near a big pool in the river,"" said Orchard. ""After supper we'll all take a swim, and feel as fresh as pond-lilies,"" said Dad.. The final leg of the trip was a three-hour ride through Concho's timber. After a long day's ride, the men were saturated with fine alkaline dust. They decided to go for a swim in the nearby pool.. Orchard was sitting on the rock waiting for his turn to dive. Long John, patting his naked shoulder, said admiringly, ""Orchard, if I had as purty a plump shoulder as you have, I'd have my. Orchard looked over the edge of the rock at his reflection in the water, and ventured, ""Wouldn't I need a shave?"" Dad asked, ""How comes it, Jack, that you are so pitted in the face and neck with pox-marks, and there. ""I never felt so. ""I had one hundred and ninety dollars in my pocket when I took down with them, and only had eight left when I got up and was able to go to work,"" he said. ""Well, but you must recollect that there was five of us taken down at the same time, and the other four. Every horse or mule was either picketed or hobbled. Every man washed his saddle blankets, as the long continuous ride had made them rancid with sweat. There was the usual target practice and the never-ending cleaning of firearms.. ""We crept up the little hill, and there over in a draw was the cause of their fear,--a big old lank Cinnamon,"" he says. ""Some fool suggested that we could drive him out in the open and rope him,"" he adds.. ""We wanted to get him out in the clear in case he played nice,"" he says. ""There was a ridge of a divide between these cedar brakes, and if the bear should attempt to cross over, he would make a fine. ""I was riding a cream-colored horse, and he was as good a one as ever was built on four pegs, except that he was nervous. He had never seen a bear, and when I gave him the rowel, he went after that bear like a cat after a mouse"". ""The horse had lashed me into the saddle by winding the rope, and at the same time windlassed the bear in on top of us"" ""The other three rode up and looked at me, and they all needed killing. One laughed till he cried, another one was so near limp he looked like a. ""Dogs and horses are very much alike about a bear,"" said one of the boys. ""Take a dog that never saw a bear in his life, and let him get a sniff of one, and he'll get up.

""We found the horses, mules, and accoutrements in a corral. They would be no trouble to get, as the bill for their keep was the only concern of the corral-keeper"" ""We were five days overtaking them, and then at a town one hundred and forty. The alcalde received the boys with great politeness, for Americans were rare visitors in his town. After giving them all the information available regarding horses, the subject innocently changed to the American prisoners in jail. The alcalde informed them that he was satisfied they were deserters, and. ""We explained, to the satisfaction of the Mexican hostler who had the stock in charge, that the owners of these animals were liable to be detained in jail possibly a month"" ""We would settle the bill for our friends and take the stock with us. When he discovered that we were armed and he was our prisoner,.

Then, with the North Star for a guide, we. ""We had to enter several ranches to get food and water,"" says the author. ""We were followed by a number of men who refused to stop and let us pass"" The author says the men refused to let him pass, so he turned them over to the police.. Gotch told of an Indian fight in which he had participated. He noticed that the first time there was a division of prize money, one item was for the capture of four deserters.

""We had two big piebald calico mules, and when we charged those Indians, those pack mules outran every saddle horse which we had, and dashing into their horse herd, scattered them like partridges,"" said the leader.. ""It was a running fight from start to finish. The last one to fall was mounted on a fine horse, and if he had only ridden intelligently, he ought to have escaped"" ""He died a hero. The shooting and smell of powder must have put iron into him, for he returned the fire"". ""Quite a while ago,"" replied Orchard. ""I was a youngster then. Well, I'll tell you; it was during the reconstruction days, when Davis was governor"" ""There's times and circumstances in this service that make the toughest of us gloomy."". ""Speaking of the disagreeable side of this service,"" said Happy Jack, ""reminds me of an incident that took all the nerve out of every one connected with it"" The incident involved a well-known horse-thief and smuggler known as El Lobo.. El Lobo was a lover of Mexican women. He was obsessed with a young woman who lived with a questionable mother. He lavished attention on her, but infatuations of that class generally have an end, often a sad one. He also had a half-blood in his company, who was used as a rival. ""The deserted condition of the ranchito where the girl lived was to our advantage as well as his. The neglect shown her by El Lobo finally turned her against him, apparently, and she agreed to betray his whereabouts the first opportunity"". ""El Lobo"" was one of the men who had helped to secure the best horses in the country. He had friends at his command to assist him in securing them. When asked if he had any friends at this ranch whom he wished to see, he denied. When we informed him that by special request a lady wished to. The girl delayed us some minutes, and we apologized to him for the necessity of irons and our presence in meeting his Dulce Corazon. When the girl came out we were some distance from the jacal. There was just moonlight enough to make her look beautiful. That moment the girl flashed into a fiend. El Lobo was missed, but the manner of his going was a secret of four men and a Mexican girl. The other two prisoners went over the road, and we even reported to them that he had attempted to strangle her. We could have gotten a big reward for him dead or alive, and had the evidence of.

0.77,0.87,64.97707590422822,"The Walnut Grove was a thickety covert on the north first bottom of the Cimarron. The grove was a well-known shelter of several bands of gray wolves. The cowmen had suffered so severely in time past from this enemy of cattle that the Cherokee Strip Cattle Association had that year offered a bounty of twenty dollars for wolf scalps. The lay of the land was extremely favorable. Across the river, and extending several miles above and below this grove, was the salt plain--an alkali desert which no wild animal, ruminant or carnivorous, would attempt to cross, instinct having warned it of its danger. It was a clear, frosty morning that bespoke an equally clear day for the wolf rodeo. The WalnutGrove was an extremely favorable lay. The Cimarron River, which surrounds this horseshoe on all sides but the entrance, was probably two hundred yards wide at an average winter stage, deep enough to swim a horse. After passing the grove, this plum-brush country could be covered by men on horseback. This cut-bank formed the second bottom on that side, and the alkaline plain--the first bottom--ended a mile or more up the river. The first bottom was a sand dune bottom of several miles, covered by wild plum brush, terminating in a perfect horsesho a thousand acres in extent.. The Cherokees used this outlet as a hunting-ground after their enforced emigration from Georgia. Legend said that the Cherokees had held numerous circle hunts over the same ground after buffalo, deer, and elk. A number of old cowmen were present, and to them was delegated the duty of appointing the officers of the day. Bill Miller, a foreman on the Coldwater Pool, an adjoining range, was appointed as first captain. There were also several captains over divisions, and an acting captain placed over every ten men, who would be held accountable for any disorder allowed along the line under his special charge. The question of forbidding the promiscuous carrying of firearms met with decided opposition. The Eagle Chief begged that the start be delayed till their arrival.. ""I'll be perfectly responsible for any of my men,"" said Reese, a red-headed Welsh cowman from over on Black Bear. ""I hope another Christmas Day to help eat a plum pudding on the banks of the Dee,"" replied Hollycott, superintendent of the ""LX"" ""Yes; we're going to have egg-nog at our camp to-night,"" replied Reese. ""Did you hear me?"" said Hollycott. ""Yes, I heard you. Did you hear you?"" ""Yes,"" said the Welshman, ""I did."" ""I don't want to be carrying any of your stray lead in my carcass either,"" replied the superintendent. ""It would be fine satisfaction to be shot by a responsible man like you or any ofyour outfit,"" replied Hollycott.. The men were being told off in squads of ten when a cavalcade of horsemen was sighted coming over the divide several miles distant. Tom Cave was given two hundred men and sent to the upper end of the grove, where they were to dismount, form in a half circle skirmish-line covering the width of the thicket, and commence the drive down the river. Reese was sent with a hundred and fifty men to left flank theGrove, deploying his men as far back as the second bottom, and close his line as the drive moved forward. Four of the oldest men were detailed as horse wranglers, four of the most experienced as wrangler. The men were all well known west end Strippers, numbering fifty-four men and having ridden from the Eagle Chief, thirty-five miles, starting two hours before daybreak.. The men were ordered to form a line from the end of the road to the top of the hill. They were to follow the line until they reached the top, where they were to meet the rest of the men. The men were then ordered to follow them down the hill to the bottom, where the men were to stop and wait for the men to arrive. The result was a line of men in the middle of the ground, with the men in a line, with their backs to the men on the ground. The line was the only one that could stop the men from reaching the top and the men who had been ordered to stop were the men of El Lobo. The rest were ordered back to the base of the drive, and the rest were sent to the other side.. The drive was to spread the last feast of the wolves. Miller had so set his heart on making this drive a success that this morning he appeared alert and aggressive as he rode forward and back across the plateau of the Butte. The promoters of this drive gathered a number of worthless lump-jawed cattle two days in advance, and driving them to the edge of the grove. The drive was a success. The wolves had been driven off. The Butte was deserted with the exception of a few old cowmen, two ladies, wife and sister of a popular cowman, and the captain, who from this point of vantage surveyed the field.. Cave and his squad were seen with the naked eye to scale the bank and strike up the river at a gallop. The dull, heavy reports of several shotguns caused him to wheel his horse and cover the beef ford with his glass. They had been given one hundred rounds of six-shooter ammunition to the man and were expected to use it. The long yell passed from the upper end of the grove to the mouth of the horseshoe and back, punctuated with an occasional shot by irrepressibles. The next moment the barking of two hundred six-shooters was reechoing up and down the valley of the Salt Fork. It was known that the ford was saddle-skirt deep, and some few of the men were strangers to it; but with that passed safely he felt easier. Reese's men were making slow but steady progress. A buck and doe came out about halfway down the grove, sighted the horsemen, and turned back for shelter. Pandemonium broke out as every carbine or six-shooter in or out of range rained its leaden hail at the flying covey. One fine bird was accidentally winged, and half a dozen men broke from the line to run it down, one of whom was Reese himself. The mounts of the day were the pick of over five thousand cow-horses, and corn-fed for winter use, in the pink of condition and as impatient for the coming fray as their riders. The fight was over in less than an hour, and the men were on their way back to their horses.. The line was not dangerously broken nor did harm result. Miller was present and addressed this query to Reese: ""Who is the captain of this flank line?"" Reese ignored the question and held the gobbler up for inspection. Miller galloped away to ascertain its cause. He met Lynch coming up, who reported that several wolves had been sighted. At the lower end of the line some of the boys had been trying their guns up and down the river to see how far they would carry. Some of them will be your own. That turkey might eat a few grasshoppers, but you're cowman enough to know that a wolf just loves to kill a cow while she's calving. That's what I'm trying to tell you, Reese.. The line was condensed to about a mile in length. Miller rode back down the line with him until he met his own camp. He hurried back to oversee personally the mounting of the horses. The line continued to move forward at a quicker pace after the break. The drive was eventually stopped by the end of the day. It was the first time the line had come to a halt since the start of the war. The battle was won by the British. The Battle of the Bulge was fought in 1864. The final battle was held in 1866. The British won the battle. The victory was followed by the Battle of Gettysburg. The war was won in 1875. The last battle was in 1881. The conflict was won on the battlefield by the Allies.. The buck and doe came out within sight of the line once more, lower down opposite the sand dunes, and again turned back. Rebuffed in their several attempts to force the line, they had taken to the water and were swimming the river. As they came out of the river, half a dozen six-shooters were paying them a salute in lead. But the excitability of the horses made aim uncertain, and they rounded the cut-bank at the upper end and escaped. While the deer were making their escape, a band of antelope were sighted sunning themselves amongst the sand Dunes a mile below. attracted by the shooting, they were standing at attention. The antelope, attracted by their sighting, were standing on the opposite bank and firing at them.. The antelope broke through a cordon to reach high ground. The men were unable to stop the animals, and had to lasso them to stop them. The antelope were so disgusted with their catch that the men dismounted and let it go. The man who lassoed the buck was so disgusted he dismounted, ear-marked the kid, andLet it go, he said, and let the buck go. ""Pard"" Sevenoaks, from the J+H, fastened to the smallest one in the band. He was so. disgusted with his catch that he dismounted, earmarked the child, andlet it go."" The men shot at them without bringing one to grass. With guns empty they loosened their ropes and met them.. Juan Mesa tied a rope to his horse's saddle to stop an antelope. Mesa had made his cast with so large a loop that one leg of the antelope had gone through. An Eagle Chief man slipped up and cut the rope through the knot. A Mexican was burning the grass, calling on saints and others to come and help him turn the buck loose. When the rope had burned its way through his gloved hands, he looked at them in astonishment, saying, ""That was one bravo buck"" But there was none to explain. An antelope was dragging thirty-five feet of rope in a frantic endeavor to overtake his band. The line had been closing gradually until at this juncture it had been condensed to about five miles. Wolves had been sighted numerous times running from covert to covert, but few had shown themselves to the flank line.. Cave and his well-formed circle of beaters were making good time. Whenever the beaters would rout or sight a wolf, the yelling would continue up and down the line for several minutes. The extreme point of this horseshoe was a sand bar with no shelter except driftwood trees. Edwards and his squad were at their post across the river, in plain view of the advancing line. Suddenly they were seen to dismount and lie down on the brink of the cut-bank. A few minutes later chaos broke out along the line, when a band of possibly twenty wolves left their cover and appeared on the sand bar. A. few rifle shots rang out from the opposite bank, when they skurried back to cover. The line under Lynch was as impatient as it was hilarious. Miller made the circle every half hour or so.. The line was halted. In the line was a horseman every ten or twelve feet. All the captains rode up and down begging the men to cease shooting entirely. This only had a temporary effect, for shortly the last bit of cover was passed, and there within four hundred yards on the bar was a snarling, snapping band of gray wolves. The unlooked-for question now arose how to make the kill safe and effective. It would be impossible to shoot from the opposite bank without endangering the line of men and horses. Finally a small number of rifles were advanced on the extreme left flank to within two hundred yards of the quarry. They proved poor marksmen, overshooting, and only succeeded in wounding a few and forcing several to take to the water. It became necessary to recall the men back to the line.. The fusillade which greeted them was like a skirmish-line in action. The most effective execution was with buckshot as they came staggering and water-soaked out of the water. Every gun was belching fire and lead at him, while tufts of fur floating in the air told that several shots were effective. Wounded he met the horsemen, striking right and left in splendid savage ferocity. The horses snorted and shrank from him, and several suffered from his ugly thrusts. An occasional effective shot was placed, but every time he forced his way through the cordon he was confronted by a second line. By the time they had lessened the intervening distance by one half, the entire band deserted their leader and retreated, but unmindful of consequences he rushed forward at the line.. The wolves were killed by a well-directed shot by the roper. The line was ransacked for volunteers who could shoot a rifle with some little accuracy. The sun on the white sand made their marksmanship so shamefully poor. They were recalled, and it was decided to send in four shotguns and try the effect of buckshot from horseback. This move was disastrous, though final. It was afterward attributed to the glaring of the sun. The wolves were finally killed by the shot of a roper from the horse. The wolf was killed when he fastened his fangs into a stirrup fender, when a well directed shot by the roper silenced him safely at last. The battle was won by the men of the line.. The dogs of war were loosed. Hell popped. The smoke of six hundred guns arose in clouds. There were wolves swimming the river and wolves trotting around amongst the horses, wounded and bewildered. Men dismounted and clubbed them with shotguns and carbines,--anything to administer death. Horses were powder-burnt and cried with fear, or neighed exultingly. There was an old man or two who had sense enough to secure the horses of the ladies and lead them out of immediate danger. To a man, the line broke to the rescue, while the horses were carried into the melee in the excitement. The wolves were tied to horses to be dragged to death or trampled.. The hunt was a success, but the animals were docil. The bounty money would be used to perfect arrangements, so that in other years a banquet would crown future hunts. Several wolves made their escape, and squads of horsemen were burying cruel rowels in heaving flanks in an endeavor to overtake and either rope or shoot the fleeing animals. By actual count, the lifeless carcases of twenty-six wolves graced the sand bar, with several precincts to hear from. ""Who gets the turkey?"" some one asked. ""The question is out of order,"" replied Reese, ""The property is not present, because I sent him home by my cook an hour ago"". ""My camp is the only one in the Strip that will have turkey and egg-nog to-night,"" he says. ""If any of you"

The story is told in the novel ""The Adventures of Mr. Medicine"" by William Faulkner, published in 1847. The novel is about a soldier's search for a lost cow. The author, who was a member of the crew, says the story was inspired by a real-life incident.. The story was told by a man called Californy. Californy was the foreman of a cattle company. He was asked to count a herd of cattle, but refused to do so. Californian was then tackled by the foremen. The story was then told by Californy to the boss of the company. The boss was furious with Californy, and ordered him discharged.. ""The cattle business has gone to the dogs,"" said Californy. ""I'll make an example of you as a warning to others"" ""You're just like the rest of them!' roared the boss. ""What's got into you boys?"" asked the foreman. ""You have men that will pull you through if you'll only let them"" ""I wouldn't make any examples as you were thinking of doing,"" replied Californy. 'When you talk of unhorsing and leaving me here afoot in a country a thousand miles from nowhere, you don't know what that means, but there's no danger of your doing it' 'I'm sorry to see you make such a fool of yourself,' said the pox-marked lad. 'You'll have to revise your ideas a trifle; in fact, change your tactics' 'If you ever so much as lay your hand on it, when you are making threats as you have done to-day, I'll build a fire in. ""You're off your reservation bigger than a wolf, when you try to run things by force,"" said the medicine man. ""Don't try and make talk stick for actions, nor use any prelude to the real play you wish to make,"" said Californy. ""As he released his grip on the bridle reins, he continued, 'Now ride back to the wagon, throw off that gun, tell some of. 'I want a close count of the cows' 'I want the cows to be counted' 'The cows will be counted, and the cows will then be counted.' 'I don't want the cattle to be killed' 'We'll count the cows, and then count them again' 'And then we'll count again' ""I want to know what the cows are doing?"" 'I'm sure they're doing fine' 'No, they're not' 'They're not doing anything'. ""Well, we lined them up and got them strung out in shape to count, and our point-men picking out a favorite rise,"" he said. ""It took a full half hour to put them through, and when the rear guard of crips and dogies passed this impromptu review, we all waited patiently for the verdict"" ""If you miss them over a hundred, I'll speak to the management, and. ""He jogged back to the wagon and satisfied the dethroned medicine man that the cattle were there to a hoof"" ""I got thirty-three seven. How does the count suit you, boss?' said Pink. ""I'm surprised to find such good men with a common cow herd,"" he said. ""By rights, I ought to have one of those centre fire cigars to smoke, to set off my authority properly on. ""I hope you all noticed how worried he looks, and, to my judgment, he seems to be losing flesh. I don't like to suggest anything, but the day before we reach the railroad, I think a day's curlew shooting in the sand hills along the Arkansas River might please his highness"" ""I'll never come back to this herd. It won't hurt him any to sleep out one night with the dry cattle,"" said Bad Medicine. ""I don't think he'll go with me, if I don' t lose him. ""We were encamped on a nice stream, and instead of trailing along with the herd, lay over for that day. Night came and our hunters failed to return, and the next morning we trailed forward towards the Arkansas River"" ""Just as we went into camp at noon, two horsemen loomed up in sight coming down the trail from above"" ""I wasn't going to be left behind with the cook to look for the missing stock, and told the segundo so"". ""The scheme worked all right. We divided into squads of three or four men each and went out and looked up the horses, but it was after six o'clock before we trailed them down and got the missing animals"" ""If anybody thinks I'm going to stay behind to look for missing stock in a country full of lurking Indians--well, they simply don't know me.' "" ""The next morning Bad Medicine authorized Pink to take the herd to Ogalalla on the Platte, while. ""On reaching Ogalalla, a man from Montana put in an appearance in company with poor old Medicine, and as they did business strictly with Pink, we were left out of the grave and owly council of medicine men. Well, the upshot of the whole matter was that Pink was put in charge of the herd, and a better foreman I never worked under"". Ace: ""I always was such a poor hand afoot that I passed up that country, and here I am a 'boomer'"" Joe: ""It is quite a long time between drinks,"" remarked Joe, rising, ""but I didn't want to interrupt Ace.""

0.44,0.54,39.00806590012013,"The Old Western Trail was closed for nearly a week due to high water. The trail was closed to cattle for several days as the water receded. ""It was a wet, bad year on the Old Western trail,"" says the author. ""We were expected to arrive in Dodge early in June, but when we reached the North Fork of the Canadian, we were two weeks behind time"" The trail is now open to cattle.. The cattle were looking as fine as silk. The horses were in good trim, considering the amount of wet weather we had had. Old George was as tickled as a little boy to meet us all. Carter was so impatient that he could not wait, as he had a prospective buyer on his hands, and the delay in the appearing of the herd was very annoying to him. We had left western Texas with a few over thirty-two hundred head and were none shy. Theodore Baughman was foreman of our outfit. He had learned to take things as they came, play the cards as they fell, and not fret himself about little things that could not be helped. If we had been a month behind he would never have thought to explain the why or wherefore to old man Carter. We were all anxious to get home in time to vote for Sol Ross, who was nominated for Governor.. Cow Springs, Kansas, ""earned the reputation honestly of being a hard cow-town,"" said Baugh. Baugh was scouting for the army when he was asked if he had seen three hundred nigger soldiers. ""No,"" said the cowboy, ""I've lost about that many."" Baugh: ""Cow Springs was at its worst when it became the terminus of one of the many eastern trails"". ""He kept his record a vivid green by shooting first and asking questions afterward"" The office was vacated so frequently in this manner that at last no local man could be found who would have it. ""He proved his own double both in morals and courage"" ""He had won his way into public confidence with his little gun"" ""There was no man to dare him to shoot, and he longed for other worlds to conquer"" 'He kept the people thoroughly buffaloed'. ""Strange no one ever attempted to rob the stage or private conveyance,"" says the author. ""The average robber was careful of his person, and could not be induced to make a target of himself for any money consideration,"" he adds. ""Before the herds began to reach as far north, the marshal and his deputy gave some excuse and disappeared for a few days, which was quite common and caused no comment,"" he writes.. The robbers abandoned the robbery and ran to their horses. They were pursued by a posse of well-mounted men. The robbers had the decided advantage of the robbers, as their horses were fresh, and the men knew every foot of the country. The posse were as determined a set of men as were ever called upon to meet a similar emergency, says the author. The men were well mounted and as determined to meet an emergency as were called upon in a similar situation.. The robbers entered a deep coulee, and when the posse saw them enter this they knew that their capture was only a matter of time. They were seen to take shelter in a clump of wild plum brush. Seeing the numbers against them, they came out on demand and surrendered. Less than an hour's time had elapsed between the shooting in the bank and the capture. The identity of the prisoners was soon established by citizens.. The men were taken quietly out and hanged. At the final moment there was a remarkable variety of nerve shown. The boy who had that day written his parents his last letter met his fate with Indian stoicism. He cursed the crouching figures of his pardners for enticing him into this crime, and begged them not to die like curs, but to meet bravely the fate which he admitted they all deserved. The latter admitted their identity to the mob.. Port Cole: ""We all regretted it the next day when he and the old man left us"" ""It is a common anomaly in life that the bad man with his record often shows the white feather when he meets his fate at the hands of an outraged community"" ""Such nerve is seldom met in life, and those that are supposed to have it, when they come face to face with their end, are found lacking that quality"" ""I've heard my father tell about those Cherokees,"" said Port Cole.. ""My father was a small boy at the time, and says that his father hired the guide for the entire trip for forty dollars in gold"" ""You couldn't risk white folks that way."" ""My father said his first thought, on their return to the Indian village, was to see if the money was untouched. It was. You couldn'trisk white folks"" ""I was a little boy. I didn't know what was going to happen to me,"" he said. Port: ""Suppose you save your wages this summer and try it next year when we start up the trail, just to see how it will work"" Shaw: ""Isn't it strange,"" said Bat Shaw, ""that if you trust a man or put confidence in him he won't betray you?"" Port: ""Well, if it's just the same to you,"" replied Port, lighting a fresh cigar, ""I'll not try, for I'm well enough satisfied as to how it would turn out, without testing. ""They bought a band of sheep, and it was necessary to pay for them at a point some forty miles further up the river. There had been some robbing along the river, and these men felt uneasy about carrying the money to this place"" The banker came to the rescue by advising them to send the money by the Mexican, who could take it through in a single night. ""He carried the money over forty miles that night, and delivered it safely in the morning"". The two men were killed by a Mexican who wanted to steal their money. They had gone to the banker to deposit their money with a different house farther up the river. The first night they camped the Mexican murdered them both, took the money, and crossed into Mexico. He hid their bodies, and it was months before they were missed, and a year before their bones were found. He had plenty of time to go to the ends of the earth before his crime would be discovered.. ""What guard are you going to put me on to-night?"" inquired old man Carter of Baugh. ""This outfit,"" said Baugh, in reply, ""don't allow any tenderfoot around the cattle,--at night, at least. You'd better play you're company; somebody that's come"". ""Why is it that you never tell that experience you had once amongst the greasers?"" asked Baugh. ""Well, there was nothing funny in it to me,"" said Carter, ""and they say I never tell it twice alike"" ""Why, certainly, tell us,"" said the cattle-buyer. ""I've never heard it. Don't throw off to-night."". ""I had nothing but a small hand-bag, and it contained only a six-shooter"" ""I bought a book to read on the train and on the road out, called 'Other People's Money' The title caught my fancy and it was very interesting"" ""The driver insisted on starting at once, telling me that we could reach the Hacienda Grande by ten o'clock that night"" ""We had a double-seated buckboard and covered the country rapidly"" ""There were two Mexicans on. ""I had enough of other people's money on my person to set all the bandits in Mexico on my trail,"" he said. ""Before leaving I noticed a Pinto horse hitched to a tree some distance in the rear of the house,"" he added. ""I inquired for his owner, but they told me that he was not about at present"" ""The evening was warm and sultry and threatening rain,"" he wrote. ""We had been on our way about an hour when I realized we had left the main road and were bump. ""I was dreaming along when we came to a sudden stop before what seemed a deserted jacal"" ""Here's where we stay all night. This is the hacienda."" ""I never knew before that I could put up such a fine defense, for inside a minute I had them both blinded in their own blood"" ""I reached down and picked up my little grip and was in the act of opening it, when one of them grabbed my arm and jerked me out of the seat"". ""I had no more idea where I was or which way I was going than a baby,"" he says. ""I gathered up rocks and had them flying when I heard a clatter of hoofs coming down the arroyo like a squadron of cavalry"" ""I took to the brush, without hat, coat, or pistol. Men that pack a gun all their lives never have it when they need it,"" he adds.. ""If there had been a strolling artist about looking for a picture of Despair, I certainly would have filled the bill,"" he says. ""The sleeves were torn out of my shirt, and my face and arms were scratched and bleeding from the thorns of the mesquite"" ""No one who could have seen me then would ever have dreamed that I was a walking depositary of 'Other People's Money'. ""In answer to my knock at the door a woman opened it about two inches and seemed to be more interested in examination of my anatomy than in listening to my troubles"" ""I assured her that I was perfectly sane, and that all I needed was food and clothing, for which I would pay her well. It must have been my appearance that aroused her sympathy, for she admitted me and fed me"" ""The woman had a little girl of probably ten years of age. This little girl brought me water to wash myself, while. ""I kept the brush for an hour or so, and finally came out on the mesa. Here I found a flock of sheep and a pastore. From this shepherd I learned that I was about ten miles from the main road"" ""I was kindly received and cared for. This ranchero sent after officers and had the country scoured for the robbers"" ""The only thing that kept me alive was the kindness of my hosts"". ""I would have gone back and testified against the owner of the spotted horse if it hadn't been for a woman and a little girl who depended on him, robber that he was"" ""I've made you a bed out of the wagon-sheet, and rustled a few blankets from the boys"" ""You'll find the bed under thewagon-tongue, and we've stretched a. ""This is no time to throw off, or refuse to be sociable,"" says Baugh. ""I don't remember the amount of money I had. It was the proceeds of something like one hundred and fifty beeves, in a small bag along of some old clothes"" ""The driver answered to the name of South-Paw, drove six horses, and we had a jolly crowd on top,"" he adds.. An empty five-gallon oil-can had been cut in half and used as a reflector, throwing full light into the road. South-Paw uncurled his whip, and was in the act of pouring the leather into them, when that light was uncovered.. ""The man giving these orders stood a few feet behind the lamp and out of sight, but the muzzle of a Winchester was plainly visible and seemed to cover every man on the stage"" ""Now, every son-of-a-horse-thief, get out on this side of the coach, please, and be quick about it!' "" ""Kill any one that gets off on the opposite side!' "". ""It was not known what he got out of the mail, but the passengers yielded about nine hundred revenue to him, while there was three times that amount on top the coach in my grip, wrapped in a dirty flannel shirt,"" he said. ""It took him over an hour to do the job; he seemed in no hurry,"" he added. ""I felt good over it, as the money in the grip had been overlooked,"" he wrote.. ""He was captured the same day. He had hired a horse out of a livery stable the day before, to ride out to look at a ranch he thought of buying"" ""In a grip which he carried were a number of sacks, which he supposed contained gold dust, but held only taulk on its way to assayers in Denver"" ""We were all detained as witnesses. He was tried for robbing the mails, and was the coolest man in the court room"". ""At the trial he never tried to hide his past, and you couldn't help liking the fellow for his frank answers,"" says the author. ""He was a tall, awkward-looking fellow, light complexioned, with a mild blue eye,"" he adds. ""His voice, when not disguised, would mark him amongst a thousand men,"" the. ""He went over the road a second time, and wasn't in the Federal prison a year before he was released through influence"" ""He was never made to hold as cool a rascal as he was. Have you a match?""

0.27,0.37,25.62616435520596,"Little Jack Martin was a cripple and could not ride, but he could cook. The ""J+H"" camp, where he presided over the kitchen, was noted for good living. Men returning from a hard month's work would brace themselves against fried chicken, eggs, milk, and fresh vegetables.. Jack was a cripple who could act so much better than he could talk. His best qualities shone their brightest when there were a dozen men around to cook for. Every man was Jack's friend, and an enemy was an unknown personage. After drinking alkali water for a month and living out of tin cans, who wouldn't love. Jack was middle-aged when the proclamation of the President opening the original Oklahoma was issued. Jack had coveted a spot in the section which was to be thrown open, and he asked the foreman to help him get it. He had been all over the country when it was part of the range, and had picked out a spot on Big Turkey Creek.. Jack described the spot he desired to claim by an old branding-pen which had been built there when it had been part of the range. The lightest weight was Billy Edwards. Billy had ironed up many a calf in those same pens himself. This qualification gave him the preference over us all.. The coyote horse was given special care from this time forward. ""Well, Jack,"" said Billy, ""if this outfit don't put you on the best quarter section around that old corral, you'll know that they have throwed off on you"". The next day when the word was given that made the land public domain, Billy was in line on the coyote. He held his place to the front with the best of them. After the first few miles, the others followed the valley of Turkey Creek, but he maintained his course like wild fowl.. ""Any man who could ride twelve miles to the coyote's ten with Billy Edwards in the saddle was welcome to the earth,"" said one of the men. ""Well, fellows, it's the expected that's happened this time,"" said he.. ""If you are satisfied that he is a sooner,"" said Miller, ""he has to go"" ""Yes, there's a sooner on it, and he puts up a fine bluff of having ridden from the line,"" said Edwards. ""There isn't a wet hair on his horse, while the. ""I certainly do,"" was the reply. Edwards confronted him and said, ""Do you contest my right to this claim?"" Mouse prodded the cold steel muzzle of a six-shooter against his ear.. ""Can any of you boys tie a hangman's knot?"" he asked. ""Yes, let me,"" responded several. ""Mebby so he'd like. ""Try that other limb,"" said Coon to Edwards; ""there's not so much brush in the way"" ""I think I know this man--think he worked for me once in New Mexico,"" said Miller. ""Any prayer that he might offer couldn't get a hearing amongst men,. We called to him to halt as half a dozen of his men came to his aid. He turned around and gave us a slap on the back of the head. We were told to stop, but he continued. He had to be told to go back to the camp.. The last night we spent with Jack was one long to be remembered. A bright fire snapped and crackled in the ample fireplace. Every one did two ordinary days' work. We sawed and chopped and hewed for dear life. On the fourth day we gave up the tent, as the smoke curled upward from our own chimney.. Jack Edwards, a young boy, was given a coyote horse by his father. The horse began to act up, but it was nothing more than corn he'd been eating. Edwards was given the horse and told he could keep house for a girl.. ""He just wants to show Jack how it affects a cow-horse to graze a few days on a boomer's claim,--that's all,"" said Edwards, when he joined us. ""He's just running a little bluff on Billy,"" said Miller.. ""You come around in a few years and you'll find him as cosy as a coon, and better off than any of us,"" said Miller. Miller himself went back to see Jack within ten days, remaining a week. None of us stayed at the home ranch any more than we could help. We visited other camps on hatched excuses, until the home. ""It was a busy year with us. Our range was full stocked, and by early fall was rich with fat cattle. We lived with the wagon after the shipping season commenced. Then we missed Jack, although the new cook did the best he knew how. Train after train went out of our pasture, yet the cattle were never missed"". Jack and Miller prowled off in an opposite direction from the beef herd, possibly half a mile, and afoot, too. They did not come back to camp until the moon was up and the second guard had gone out to relieve the first. When they came back not a word was spoken. They unrolled Miller's bed. ""If that little game-legged rooster hasn't gone and deluded some girl back in the State into marrying him, I'm a horse-thief,"" says Miller. ""It isn't every day that we have a chance at a wedding in our little family, and when we get the word, this outfit quits then and. ""It will be our night to howl, and every man will be a wooly wolf,"" said Miller. Miller gave the happy pair a little ""Flower Pot"" cow, which he had rustled in the Cheyenne country on the round-up a few years before.. Coon Floyd's compliments went with five cow-bells, which we always thought he rustled from a boomer's wagon that broke down over on the Reno trail. Edwards presented him with a log chain that a bone-picker had lost in our pasture. Mouse gave Jack a four-tined fork which the. ""We took the wagon with us to carry our bedding and the other plunder, driving along with us a cow and a calf of Jack's, the little ""Flower Pot"" cow, and a beef. Our outfit reached Jack's house by the middle of the afternoon. The first thing was. ""I expect to dance with the bride--in the head set--a whirl or two myself,"" said Mouse. ""You would look all right with only a cotton string around your neck,"" said Edwards. ""If I'd only thought,"" chimed in Coon, "". The first day of the festival was a success, with the crowd enjoying the music and dancing. The day was followed by a day of rest for the girls, who were given time off from school. The final day was a day off for the boys, who had to stay at home and play in the field.. Jack got us boys pardners for every dance. Not a one of us got a dance with her even. Mouse admitted next day, as we rode home, that he squeezed her hand several times in the grand right and left. After supper Billy corralled her in a corner, she seeming willing, and stuck to her until her brother. The dance went on full blast until the wire edge was well worn off the revelers. Miller ordered the Indian war-dance as given by the Cheyennes. The fiddlers caught the inspiration and struck into ""Sift the Meal and save the Bran"""
0.34,0.44000000000000006,30.493050959629386,"Texas was border territory upon her admission to the sisterhood of States. No State in the Union was ever called upon to meet and deal with the criminal element as was Texas. Once it was the Ultima Thule of the criminal western world. From the man who came for not building a church to the one who had taken human life, the catalogue of crime was fully represented.. The settlers were often the victims of criminal immigration from other Southern States. The most common type of criminal was a horse-thief who stole a man's horse. A band of neighbors, together in a posse, followed and brought to bay the marauders. Some of these fugitives from justice became good citizens, but the majority later took up former callings.. There was a frontier on the south and west of over two thousand miles to be guarded. On the south was to be met the bandit, the smuggler, and every grade of criminal known to the code. The companies, few in number at first, were gradually increased until the State had over a dozen companies in the field. These companies numbered anywhere from ten to sixty men.. The Ranger had no equal. The emergency that produced him no longer existing, he will never have a successor. He was shot at at short range oftener than he received his monthly wage. He admired the criminal that would fight, and despised one that would surrender on demand. He would nurse back to life a dead-game man whom his own shot had brought to earth.. Rust-proof, rugged, and tireless, he gave the State protection for life and property. ""Here, take my glass and throw down on that grove of timber yonder, and notice if there is any sign of animal life to be seen,"" said Sergeant ""Smoky"" C----, addressing ""Ramrod"". Ramrod's observations were cut short at sight of the cattle, and we pushed out for the grove, about seven miles distant. He dismounted at the sergeant's request, and focused the glass on this oasis, and after sweeping the field for a minute or so, remarked languid. ""I'm not tasty,"" said Sergeant Smoky, ""but I would give the preference this morning to a well-roasted side of ribs of a nice yearling venison over the salt hoss that the Lone Star State furnishes this service"" ""Let me try,"" begged a little man we called ""Cushion-foot."" What his real name was none of us knew.. ""Good long shot, little man,"" said the sergeant, ""and you may have the choice of cuts, just so I get a rib."" The two rode in with a fine two-year-old buck across the pommel of Cushion's saddle. They had only disemboweled him, but Conajo had the heart as a trophy of the accuracy of the shot.. ""We put the prisoners to roasting the ribs, and making themselves useful in general,"" said Smoky. ""It was an object lesson to them. One said to the other, ""Es un buen tirador."" ""I never hear a man hanker for liquor,"" said Conajo, as he poured out a tin cup of coffee.. One of the rankest, rabid political admirers my father had lived away out on a spur of this county. He lived good thirty miles from the county seat. Didn't come to town over twice a year, but he always stopped, generally over night, at our house. He would always abuse my father for not coming to see him.. ""I hope you don't think for a moment that I wouldn't like to visit you; now do you?' said the sheriff. ""That's all I ask, Sam,' was his only reply. Now I've learned lots of the ways of the world since then. I've seen people pleasant to each other, and behind their backs the tune changed"". 'I never saw him so embarrassed before in my life,' said father. 'I did ride out of my way, but I was glad of the chance' 'Men like Joe Evans are getting scarce,' he said. 'They meant every word and meant it deep' 'I was glad to see him again,' he added. 'He was a good man'. Ramrod was on guard, but he was so hungry himself that he was good enough to let the prisoners eat at the same time. ""Hell, no, Sam, there's nothing wrong. You know I'm acquainted all around here."" He turned in the path, and there was the most painful look in his face I ever saw.. After breakfast was over we smoked and yarned. It would be two-hour guards for the day, keeping an eye on the prisoners and stock, only one man required. Conajo had the first guard after breakfast. ""I remember once,"" said Sergeant Smoky, as he crushed a pipe of twist with the heel of his hand, ""we were camped out on the 'Sunset' railway"". The incident took place on the railroad, at a bridge construction camp. An Irishman had killed a Chinaman. The old sabre renewed his youth to a certain extent, for he used it in self-defense shortly afterwards. He was an old man now, the storekeeper for the iron supplies, a kind of trusty job.. The Chink kept missing his pies, and got a helper to spy out the offender. The result was they caught the old man red-handed in the act. The Chink armed himself with the biggest butcher-knife he had and went on the warpath. He found the old fellow sitting in his storeroom contentedly eating the pie. The old man had his eyes on the cook, and saw the knife just in time to. Judge Bean held court in an outhouse, the prisoner seated on a bale of flint hides. Bean was not only judge but prosecutor, as well as counsel for the defense. ""I suggested to the court that the prisoner be informed of his rights, that he need not plead guilty unless he so desired,"" said Bean.. ""He rummaged over a book or two for a few moments and then said, 'Here, I reckon this is near enough. A Chinaman ought to be half as good as a nigger. Stand up and receive your sentence' "" "". ""I'll bet a twist of dog,"" said Ramrod, ""that prisoner with the black whiskers sabes English. Officer, take charge of the prisoner until it's paid!' It took about ten dollars to cover everything, which I paid, McKay returning it when he reached his camp. Whoever named that alcalde 'Law west of the Pecos. ""It was night before we came to their trail, and to our surprise they were heading inland, to the north"" ""They must have had a contract to supply the Mexican army with cavalry horses. They were simply sweeping the country, taking nothing but gentle stock"" ""We didn't halt all night long on either trail, pegging along at a steady gait"". ""On the head of the country there is a broken country interspersed with glades and large openings. We felt very sure that the men would make camp somewhere in that country"" ""We began to think the reports were right, for there seemed no end of horses, and at least twenty-five men."" ""We were able to gain one of those dry arroyos which would bring us within one hundred yards of the camp"". ""Opposite the camp we wormed out of the arroyo like a skirmish line, hugging the ground for the one remaining little knoll between the robbers and ourselves,"" says the author. ""We were trying to make out a man that was asleep, at least he had his hat over his face, lying on a blanket with his head in a saddle. We concluded he was a. ""Then the stuff was off and she opened up in earnest. I was on my knee pumping lead for dear life, and as I threw my carbine down to refill the magazine, a bullet struck it in the heel of the magazine with sufficient force to knock me backward"" ""I called to the boys to notice a fellow with black whiskers who was shooting from behind his horse. He would shoot over and under alternately.. ""It was a nasty fight. Two of our own boys were killed and three were wounded. But then you ought to have seen the other fellows; we took no prisoners that day"" ""The boys rounded up over a hundred horses, each one with a fiber grass halter on, besides killing over twenty wounded ones to put them out of their misery"" ""This white man proved to be a typical dandy, a queer leader for such a gang. ""He was a dandy all right, and a fine-looking man, over six feet tall, with swarthy complexion and hair like a raven's wing,"" said the survivor. ""He had as fine a gold watch in his pocket as you ever saw, while his firearms and saddle were beauties,"" he added.. Cushion-foot sat down next to Ramrod and began to tell him a story. He spoke so low that you must be near to hear him. He said that border Mexicans would steal an article and then give it away. While I was in the hospital I got my divvy of the prize money, something over four hundred dollars.. ""They called themselves Timochis. They belonged in Mexico, and a year or so before they refused to pay taxes that the Mexican government levied on them, and rebelled"" ""He was a stripling of a boy, but could palaver Spanish in a manner that would make a Mexican ashamed of his ancestry. He was about eighteen at this time and was working in a store"". The Timochi were killed when their own government sent soldiers after them. They dispersed into small bands, one of which was paying Las Palomas a social call that morning. The custom-house was a desired prize, and when my brother interpreted their desires to the collector, he consented to open the safe. Uncle Sam's strong-box yielded up over a thousand dobes.. ""The chief then said that he had a favor to ask: that my brother should cheer for the revolutionists, to identify him as a friend,"" says the author. ""So he mounted the counter and gave three cheers of 'Viva los Timochis!'

Years afterward a woman, with all the delicacy of her sex, came to this town from her home in the North and sought out his grave. As only a woman can, when some strong tie of affection binds, this woman went to work to mark the last resting-place of the wayward man.. The story of the outlaw's sister is told in a novel by the author. She reveals that she was the wife of a respectable practicing physician in Indiana. She followed her brother beyond his disgraceful end. With her own hands she performed an act that has few equals, as a testimony of love and affection."
0.9,1.0,72.81776416539051,"Some of the cattle companies on the range, whose headquarters were far removed from the scene of active operations, saw fit to give orders that the common custom of feeding all comers and letting them wear their own welcome out must be stopped. This was hard on those that kept open house the year round. Sometimes there might be ten men at a camp, and only two on the pay-roll. These extra men were called ""chuck-line riders"" Probably eight months in the year they all had employment. At many camps they were welcome, as they would turn to and help do anything that was wanted done. After a hard freeze it would be necessary to cut the ice, so that the cattle could water. A reasonable number of guests were no drawback at a time like this, as the chuck-line men would be the most active in opening the ice with axes. The cattle belonging to those who keptOpen house never got so far away that some one didn't recognize the brand and turn them back towards their own pasture.. Late in the fall three worthies of the range formed a combine, and laid careful plans of action, in case they should get let out of a winter's job. ""I've been on the range a good while,"" said Baugh, the leader of this trio, ""but hereafter I'll not ride my horses down, turning back the brand of any hidebound cattle company"" ""That won't save you from getting hit with a cheque for your time when the snow begins to drift,"" commented Stubb. ""When we make our grand tour of the State this winter,"" remarked Arab Ab, ""we'll. The boys decided to go to Kansas for the winter, and come back in the spring when men are wanted. ""Oh, we won't go broke,"" said Baugh, who was the leader in the idea. ""Still we might think that riding a chuck-line would beat footing it in a granger country, broke"" ""I know what it is to ride a chuck line myself,"" said the foreman. ""I'm sorry that any of you that care to can't spend the winter with us"" ""We are to do our own cooking,"" he said. ""It's there that my orders are very distasteful to me."" ""We won't fret about it,"" said one of the boys. ""One thing sure, we'll go broke."". ""You'll find things right side up when you come after them, and a job if I can give it to you,"" said the foreman. ""Don't you think it's poor policy,"" asked Stubb of the foremen, ""to refuse the men a roof and the bite they eat in winter?"" ""You may ask that question at headquarters, when you get your time cheque cashed,"" said Stubb. ""You all know that it's no waste of affection by this company that keeps even two of us on the pay-roll."" ""I'm going up in the State for the winter, and will wait and go in with the wagon,"" said Baugh. ""That will be all right,"" replied the forewoman.. The first snow-squall of the season came that night, and the wagon could not go in for several days. When the weather moderated the three bade the foreman a hearty good-by and boarded the wagon for town, forty miles away. This little village was a supply point for the range country to the south, and lacked that diversity of entertainment that the trio desired. So to a larger town westward, a county seat, they hastened by rail. This hamlet they took in by sections. There were the games running to suit their tastes, the variety theatre with its painted girls, and handbills announced that on the 24th of December and Christmas Day there would be horse races. To do justice to all this melted their money fast. Their gay round of pleasure had no check until the last day of the races, when they were paid.. Baugh the leader, Baugh the brains of the trio. He had named the winners so easily the day before, that now his confidence knew no bounds. ""I'm going to back that sorrel gelding, that won yesterday in the free-for-all to-day,"" said he to Stubb and Arab, ""and if you boys go in with me, we'll make a killing"" ""You can lose your money on a horse race too quick to suit me,"" replied Stubb. ""We're going to make a big money,"" said Baugh, ""if you go in. ""When I gamble and lose I never howl,"" said Baugh to his friends. ""I do love a run for my money, though I didn't have any more chance to-day than a rabbit"" ""I prefer to stick to poker, but you go ahead and win all you can, for spring is a long ways off yet"" ""My observation of you as a poker player, my dear Stubby, is that you generally play the first hand to win and all the rest to get even."" ""I like to play poker, and I like to win. I'm not a gambler, I just like to have a good time."" ""If you want to win, you have to play the game. If you don't, you're not playing the game."". ""You big chump, you! if you hadn't bet your overcoat it wouldn't be so bad. What possessed you to bet it?"" asked Stubb, half reprovingly. ""Oh, hell, I'll not need it. It's not going to be a very cold winter, nohow,"" replied Baugh, as he threw up one eye toward the warm sun. ""We need exercise. Let's walk back to town. Now, this is a little unexpected, but what have I got you boy's for, if you can't help a friend in trouble?"". Stubb and Arab were forced to take an inventory of their cash and similar assets. The result was suggestive that they would have to return to the chuck-line, or unearth some other resource. Stubb: ""Now, my dear Stubby, don't get gay with the leading lady; you may get in a bad box some day and need me."" Stubb's wife: ""You're alive. You're alive, ain't you?"" ""Stubby, you're alive,"" replied Stubb. ""I'm not alive,"" said Stubb, ""but I'm alive."". Baugh: ""My board will have to be provided for in a few days, but I have an idea, struck it to-day, and if she works, we'll pull through to grass like four time winners"" The condition of their finances lacked little of the red-ink line. The others were willing to undertake anything that looked likely to tide them over the winter. ""Leave things to me,"" said Baugh, ""Leave it to me"" ""There's a little German on a back street here, who owns a bar-room with a hotel attached,"" Baugh said. ""He has a mania to run for office; in fact, there's several candidates announced already"". Louie Seigerman, the leader of this scheme wrote it on a card--Seigerman. Baugh now reduced their finances further for a shave, while he meditated how he would launch his scheme. An hour afterwards, he walked up to the bar, and asked, ""Is Mr. Seig Berman in?"" ""Dot ish my name, sir,"" said the man behind the bar. ""I'll send a friend around to sound our German, and see what office he thinks he'd like to have."" ""In von moment,"" said Seig Herman, as he laid off his white apron and called an assistant to take his place. He then led the way to a back room, used for a store. ""My name is Baughman,"" said he, as he shook Louie's hand with a hearty grip. ""I work for the Continental Cattle Company, who own a range in the strip adjoining the county line below here. My people have suffered in silence from several bands of cattle thieves who have headquarters in this county"" ""Now, mine frendt, vat ish id?"" inquired Louie, when they were alone. ""This year we propose to assert ourselves, and try to elect a sheriff who will do his sworn duty, and run out of this county these rustling cattle thieves,"" he said. ""Now to business, as you are a business man,"" said Louie. ""It would surprise you.  Louie Baughman was asked to run for sheriff of the county. He was a wealthy cattleman. He said he would consider the request. Seigerman asked him to have a drink. Louie said he was too busy to drink. He agreed to a drink, but only if he could sit down and think. He thought about it for a few minutes, and then agreed to the drink. The barman said he had to go to the bar, and Louie followed him. The two men drank together for some time, before Louie decided to leave. He later returned to his office, where he was told he had won the election. He had been the sheriff for a year. He won the office by a landslide. He became the first black sheriff in the state of Missouri. He died in office in 1868, after being shot by a white man.. Baughman: ""Why, do you keep hotel? If I had known it, I would have put up with you"" ""You can haf any room in mine house, Mr. Baughman,"" said Seigerman. ""Let me have your answer at the earliest possible moment,"" said Baugh. ""This is a large county, and to enlist our friends in your behalf no time should be lost."" With a profusion of ""Leben Sie wohls"" and well wishes for each other, the ""Zweibund"" parted. ""I'll join you in a cigar, however, for acquaintance' sake,"" Baugh said. ""My bill is paid in advance at my hotel until Saturday,"" he said.. ""If you would like to know what an active, resourceful brain is, put your ear to my head,"" tapping his temple with his finger, ""and listen to mine throb and purr. Everything is working like silk. I'm going around to board with him Saturday. I want you to go over with me to-morrow, Stubby, and give him a big game about what a general uprising there is amongst the cowmen for an efficient man for the office of sheriff, and make it strong"" ""You can both know that I begged strong when I took this cigar in preference to a drink,"" he said. ""It's certainly a bad state of affairs we've come to when you refuse whiskey. Don't you think so, stubby?"" said Arab, addressing the one and appealing to the other. ""I gave him my last whirl to-day in German. Oh, he'll run all right; and. ""Oh, you little sawed-off burnt-offering, you can't see the policy that we must use in handling this matter,"" Stubb said. ""You never refused no drink, Baugh, you know you didn't,"" said Stubb reproachfully. ""This is a delicate play, that can't be managed roughshod on horseback,"" he added. ""The main play now is to convince Mr. Seigerman that he has a call to serve his country in the office of sheriff,"" he said. 'Bear down heavy on the emergency clause. Then make him think that no other name but Louie Seig Herman will satisfy the public clamor,' Stubb added.. Baugh introduced Stubb as a friend of his whom he had met in town that day, and who, being also interested in cattle, he thought might be able to offer some practical suggestions. ""Well, as I have until to-orrow to think it over, I'll try,"" said Stubb. ""Now, can you play your part?"" asked Baugh. ""Yes, sir,"" said the cattleman. ""I'll try to do my best."" ""Well then, I'm going to have to ask you to join me in a glass of wine,"" said Baugh, ""and then I'll tell you what I think of your idea."" ""Yes,"" said his friend. ""That's fine."" ""I'm going back to my room."". Cattlemen's pockets have been touched, their interests have been endangered. We had over fifty stolen last season, that cost us over three hundred dollars a head. We worked our saddle stock so late last fall, that on my advice the superintendent sent them into the State to be corn-fed for the winter. The bulls were too valuable to be risked on the range. Any one is good enough for sheriff with us. But this year there seems to be an awakening. It may be a selfish interest that prompts this uprising; I think it is. But that is the surest hope in politics for us. We take no interest in local politics. But we stand ready to use their best endeavors to nominate a candidate who will pledge himself to stamp out this disgraceful brand-burning and cattle-rustling. The little protection shown the livestock interests in this western country has actually driven capital out of one of the best paying industries in the West. But it is our own fault. It is the cattle-men's own fault, and we are to blame.. ""There is a brighter future for you politically than you possibly can see,"" says superintendent. ""It is a common remark Down East, so I'm told, that the weather is chilly when an Ohio man gets left,"" he adds. ""Why, it would give you the naming of fifty deputies--good easy money in every one of them,"" he says. ""With these men of our company interested in you, there would be no refusing them the appointment,"" he writes. ""You could sit back in a well-appointed government office and enjoy the comforts of life,"" says the superintendent of the sheriff's office. ""I feel confident that if you will enter the race for this office, it will be a walk-away for you,"" says Mr. Seigerman, who is a member of his company's stock-holders. ""There is no way you could turn down the offer,"" adds the superintendent, ""and it would be an easy decision for you. Baugh: ""The Ohio Cattle Company is practically the Standard Oil Company, but they don't want it known"" ""That very little man who has been talking to you has better backing than any cow-boss in the West"" ""If you positively decline to enter the race, we must look in some other quarter for an available man"" ""We will see you often, but let me suggest that your acceptance be as soon as possible, for if you positively refuse to enter, wemust look insome other quarter"" ""You know what a syndicate they are and the influence they carry. Still, you know what an influence they have"" ""I'm placing in you, and request you not to repeat it. It's a confidence that I'm placing"". ""Shentlemens, I'll dry do,"" said Louie, ""but you will not dake a drink mit me once again, aind it?"" ""No, thank you, Mr. Seigerman,"" replied Stubb. ""He gave me a very fine cigar yesterday; you'll like them if you try one,"" said Baugh to Stubb, ""Let it be a cigar to-day"" ""He's a safe, conservative fellow to listen to,"" said Stubb of Seig Herman. ""I'm coming up to stop with Mr.Seigerman to. ""I vould be wery much bleased to haf you mine guest,"" said Louie, every inch the host. ""I may come up; I'll come around Sunday and take dinner with you, anyhow"" ""I'm expecting a man from Kansas City to-morrow,"" said Baugh to Louie on Sunday morning, ""who will know the sentiment existing in cattle circles in that city. He'll be in on the morning train"" ""Do, blease,"" urged Louie. ""Do you want to join us?"" ""Yes, I would like to,"" replied Baugh. ""Why don't you join us for dinner?"". Arab Ab was the heeler, the man who could deliver the vote to order. The back room was once more used as a council chamber where the ""Fierbund"" held an important session. ""I didn't think there was so much interest being taken,"" began Arab Ab. ""We haven't had a case of fever on our range for years, nor a winter in five years that would kill an old cow"" The ""Flierbund's"" first meeting was held in the back room of a Kansas City hotel. The meeting lasted for two hours, with Arab Ab delivering the vote. It was the first meeting of the Fierb Bund's first meeting in the United States. The first meeting took place in the front room of the hotel, where Arab Ab was introduced. The second meeting was at the same hotel, but in the rear room was the back chamber.. ""When I was skinning mules for Creech & Lee, contractors on the Rock Island, one fall, they gave me my orders, which was to get every man on the works ready to ballot,"" he says. ""I lined them up and voted them like running cattle through a branding-chute to put on a tally-mark or vent a brand,"" he adds. ""There were a hundred and seventy-five of those dagoes from the rock-cut; I handled them like dipping sheep for the scab,"" Seigerman says. He adds: ""I'll admit that I'm no good as a wire-puller, but when it comes to getting out the voters, there's where you will find me as solid as a bridge abutment"" ""I'm glad to hear from my friends here, we have hopes of doing. Then when the election comes off, we must drop everything and getevery man to claim a residence in this county and vote him here,"" he writes. I had my orders from the same people I'm working for now, to get out the cow-puncher element in the Strip for the bonds. The bosses simply told me that what they wanted was a competing line of railroad. We ran in from four to five hundred men from the Strip, and out of over seven hundred ballots cast, only one against the bonds, and we wanted to hang him! The only trouble I had was to make the boys think it was a straight up Democratic play, as they were nearly all originally from Texas. I can only add that in case you consent, my people stand ready to give their every energy to this coming campaign. As far as funds are concerned to prosecute the election of an acceptable sheriff to the cattle interests, we would simply be flooded with it. It would be impossible to use one half of what would be forced on us. One thing I can say positively, Mr. Sheriff, is that my friends here have told me they are urging you to accept the nomination.. ""How many men are there in the Strip?"" asked Arab of the others. ""On all three divisions of the last round-up there were something like two thousand,"" replied Baugh. ""And this county adjoins the Cattle Country for sixty miles on the north,"" said Arab, still continuing his musing. ""If there's that many men in the country below, I'll agree to vote one half of them in this county this fall,"" he said. ""Cattle-men are big-hearted fellows--they are friends worth having, Mr. Seigerman."" ""Hold on a minute, aren't you a trifle high on your estimate?"" asked Stubb, the conservative, protestingly.. ""Give them a week's lay-off, with plenty to drink at this end of the string, and every man will come in for fifty miles either way,"" said Arab. ""They'll come from the west and south to a man, and as far east as the middle of the next county. I tell you they will be a thousand strong and a unit in voting. Watch my smoke on results!"" said Stubb. ""I think it's high time we had Mr. Seigerman's consent to make the race,"" said Baugh. ""How can I refuse to be one sheriff? The cattle-mens must be proteciously protected?"" said Arab, ""The time we voted the bonds won't be a marker to this election."" ""I'm not far wrong,"" replied Stubb, ""and the rascals will come from. The trio now arose, and with a round of oaths that would have made the captain of a pirate ship green with envy swore Seigerman had taken a step he would never regret. After the hearty congratulation on his acceptance, they reseated themselves, when Louie, in his gratitude, insisted that on pleasant occasions like this he should be permitted to offer some refreshments of a liquid nature. ""Very well, then,"" said Stubb, ""I waive my objections for sociability's sake"" ""Your uncle, my dears, will never allow you to come to want,"" said Baugh. ""Pin your faith to the old man,"" said Louie. ""I accep."" ""I never like to indulge at a bar,"" said the other two. ""The people whom I work for are very particular regarding the habits of their. The announcement of the candidacy of Mr. Louis Seigerman in the next week's paper encouraged the editor, that others might follow, to write a short, favorable editorial. The trio read this short editorial to Louie daily for the first week. All three were now putting their feet under the table with great regularity, and doing justice to the vintage on invitation. The campaign was beginning to be active, but no adverse reports were allowed to reach the candidate's ears. The back room became a private office for the central committee of four. They were able political managers. The three men were now in a position of power and control over the city. They would not let anything happen to them that would harm the city or the country. The city was in a state of transition. It was a time of great change and opportunity.. The boys had played the role as long as they cared to. It had served the purpose that was intended. The excuses offered at the feast were discounted by pressing orders. One day report came in of some defection and a rival candidate in the eastern part of the country. All hands volunteered to go out. Funds were furnished, which the central committee assured would be refunded whenever they could get in touch with their host. At the end of a week Mr. Seigerman received a letter. He had lost the election. The boys had done their best. They had done all they could. The only thing that was left was to find a way out of the mess. They could not do that. They were forced to leave the country and go back to their homes. They did not want to leave their friends behind. They wanted to be with their friends and family. They would not have been able to go back.. The letter assured Seigerman that he would be the next sheriff. The news reached the boys in the Strip, they dubbed this one vote ""Seigerman's Per Cent"" Seigman's Per cent became a byword on the range, from Brownsville, Texas, to the Milk River in Montana. At the county convention in May, Seigeman's name was presented. On each of three ballots he received one lone vote. When the news was announced, the boys called it the worst of anything. The hard winter was over. The summer was on its way. The fall was on the way."

0.87,0.97,76.0204081632653,"Texas Creek was a watering-station on the Denver and Rio Grande line. The station was surrounded by the fastnesses of the front range of the Rockies. To the southwest lay the Sangre de Cristo range, in which the band had rendezvoused and planned this robbery. Farther to the southwest arose the snow-capped peaks of the Continental Divide, in whose silent solitude an army might have taken refuge and hidden. About ten o'clock at night, as the train slowed up as usual to take water, the engineer and fireman were covered by two of the robbers. The robbers were able to escape without a single hitch. The train was carrying $1,000,000 in cash and valuables at the time of the robbery. The robber was killed by the engineer.. The robbers made short work of a through safe that the messenger could not open. The other two--there were only four--cut the express car from the train and the engineer and fireman were ordered to decamp. The express company concealed the amount of money lost to the robbers, but smelters, who were aware of certain retorts in transit by this train, were not so silent. These retorts were in gold retorts of such a size that they could be made away with as easily as though they had reached the mint and been coined. There was scarcely any excitement among the passengers, so quickly was it over. At a division of the station one hundred and fifty-six miles distant from the scene of the robbery, the U.S. Marshal was in charge. His reputation was in a large measure due to the successful use of bloodhounds to catch criminals.. The train was carrying the marshal and his dogs to their destination. The train was travelling through the Grand Canon of the Arkansas. The engine was driven by a daring engineer who threw the throttle wide open. The marshal was joined by several officials, both railway and express, on the journey. The journey was expected to take around three hours. The driver was killed in the robbery. The story was published in the book, The Railwayman, by William Makepeace Thackeray, published by Simon & Schuster, priced £16.99, with a print run of 1,500 copies. The book is available in hardback and hardback, and is available on Amazon.com for £12.99. For more information on the book and its contents, visit www.simonandschwarz.com.. Three dogs lying on the floor, and, as the rocking of the car disturbed them, growling in their dreams, turned to these dumb animals as a welcome ally. Under the guidance of their master they were an aid whose value he well understood. Their sense of smell was more reliable than the sense of seeing in man. You can believe the dog when you doubt your own eyes. His opinion is unquestionably correct. He is unquestionable correct. His opinions are unquestionably right. He was unquestionably wrong. He has been wrong. His eyes are unquestionable right. They were wrong. They have been wrong, and they will be wrong again. They will be punished for their crime. They must be punished. They are guilty. They should have been punished for what they have done. They deserve to be.. Banks and the express people found mounts awaiting them to carry them to the place of the hold-up. This was not easily done, as there were few horses at the station, while the horses of near-by ranches were turned loose in the open range for the night. The engine was unhurt, but the express car was badly shattered, and the through safe was ruined by the successive charges of dynamite that were used to force it to yield up its treasure. The local safe was unharmed, the messenger having opened it in order to save it from the fate of its larger and stronger brother. The train proceeded on its way, with the loss of a few hours' time and the treasure of its express. The robbers were killed in a gunfight with the train crew, and their bodies were found in a nearby field. The story was made famous in the film The Great Train Robbery, which was released in 1973.. Peg-Leg Eldridge was a product of that unfortunate era succeeding the civil war. During that strife the herds of the southwest were neglected to such an extent that thousands of cattle grew to maturity without ear-mark or brand to identify their owner. A good mount of horses, a rope and a running-iron in the hands of a capable man, were better than capital. The good old days when an active young man could brand annually fifteen calves--all better than yearlings--to every cow he owned, are looked back to to this day, from cattle king to the humblest of the craft, in pleasant reminiscence, though they will come no more. It was a cool, daring act of Peg-Leg and three men. Afterward, when his past history was learned, his leadership in this raid was established. It resulted in his losing a leg from a gunshot.. The trail of the robbers was easy to follow, except for the roughness of the mountain slopes. The trail was followed for several hours before the party was forced to wait for horses to arrive. After the horses arrived, the trail was abandoned. The robbers were able to continue their journey to the top of the mountains. The journey was completed in less than two days. The party was able to reach the summit of the Sangre de Cristo before the sun set. They were then able to rest and prepare for the next day's journey. The chase was completed on the third day. The group was able to reach the top by the fourth day, and then continue their way to the summit. The final day of the journey was spent on the way back to the village of La Paz. The route was followed by a number of dogs, which led the party to the bottom of the valley.. The trail was so distinct that the dogs were an unnecessary adjunct to the pursuing party. The ancestry of the dogs was Russian. Hounds of this breed never give mouth, thus warning the hunted of their approach. Man-hunting is exciting sport. The possibility, though the trail may look hours old, that any turn of the trail might disclose the fugitives, keeps at the highest tension every nerve of the pursuer. All day long the marshal and posse climbed higher and higher on the rugged mountainside. The trail was followed by two hounds, one of which was a veteran in the service, while the other two, being younger, showed an exuberance of energy and ambition in following the trail. The dogs of the Russian breed never gave mouth, so warning the hunters of their approaches.. Banks and his posse were forced to stop for the night to save their own horses. The dogs led them several miles southward on the mountain crest. The robbers had traveled in some places an entire mile over lava beds. They had left no trace which the eye could detect. Banks was forced to take it afoot now, depending on his favorite dog, which was under leash, the posse following with the mounts. He was compelled to take the dogs with him, and they were soon on the trail. The men were able to reach the top of the mountain in the early hours of the morning. They were then able to rest their horses for the rest of the night. The marshal and posse set out once more on the Trail. The chase continued until midnight, when they reached the top. The group then continued on to the summit, where they were finally able to stop. They eventually reached the summit at about 2am.. The party was forced to travel through the night to reach the top of the mountain. The trail was easily followed by dogs and the men were able to keep moving. They reached the summit an hour before nightfall. The party was able to continue for the rest of the night. The men were then able to return to the base of the mountains and continue on their way to the top. The journey took the party through a series of difficult terrain, including a difficult climb through the mountains. The team was eventually able to reach their destination. The group was then allowed to rest for the remainder of the day and night. They were then forced to continue their journey through the evening. The final destination was the town of San Vicente, where the party was finally able to complete their journey. The expedition was completed by the end of the evening, and the party returned to the town.. The posse was maintaining a due southwest course that was carrying them into the fastnesses of the main range of the western continent. Physical exertion was beginning to tell on the animals, and they were compelled to make frequent halts in the ascent of this range. The fatigue was showing in the two younger dogs. Their feet had been cut in several places in crossing the first range of mountains. During the past nights in the valley, though their master was keeping a sharp lookout, they encountered several places where sand-burrs were plentiful. The posse had to stop several times to relieve themselves, and the dogs had to be fed. They had now reached the top of the second range of mountain, and were on the way to the top again. They were now in a position to make a final stand against the enemy. The dogs were able to stop for a short time, and then the posse resumed their advance.. The marshal's dogs were webbed with burrs in the tender inner part of a dog's foot, if not removed at once, soon lame it. The nearest approach to a liniment that he possessed was a lubricating tube for guns, which he fortunately had with him. This afforded relief. The marshal himself slept several hours, but he was the last to go to sleep and the first to awake. It was daybreak when the pursuers took up the trail. The old dog, however, seemed nothing the worse for his work. He was the only one who was able to keep up with the men, and they were soon at the top of the mountain. The pursuers were so exhausted that they lay down and took their first sleep, having been over three days and a half on the trail, having spent three days on the mountain trail.. The course of the robbers continued to the southwest. The pursuers kept this plateau for several miles, and before descending the western slope of the range an abandoned camp was found. Indications of where horses had been picketed for hours, and where both men and horses had slept were evident. The trail where it left this deserted camp was in no wise encouraging to the marshal, as it looked at least thirty-six hours old. It was a trial of incessant toil down the mountain slope, wearisome alike to man and beast. Near the foot-hill of this mountain they were rewarded by finding a horse which the robbers had abandoned on account of an accident. He was an extremely fine horse, but so lame in the shoulders, apparently owing to a fall, that it was impossible to move him. The chase continued for several more miles, until the robbers doubled back an almost due east course. They could see below them where the San Juan River meanders to the west until her waters, mingling with others,. The posse were pursued by two dogs who had swollen feet. The dogs' owner sent them to a ranch several miles below in the valley. The party lost hours following the trail. They met a pastor who gave them a description of the robbers. The posse was able to track the robbers down to the ranch and arrest them. The men were taken back to the U.S. for questioning. The search for the robbers continued for several days. The team was eventually able to apprehend the robbers and return to the town of San Diego. The chase was eventually called off after the dogs were found dead in the desert. The group was able, however, to recover the dog. The man who led the posse is still alive and well. He was captured and is being held in jail. He has been charged with attempted murder and attempted kidnapping. The case is still pending.. The shepherd was unable to stand on his feet during the chase. He was lifted by the posse and taken away with them. The chase ended in New Mexico, where the dog was killed by the robbers. The shepherd's death was not considered a major incident in the story. The dog's death did not stop the chase, however. The posse was able to catch the robbers and kill them all, but the shepherd was killed in the process. The story was published in 1838. The Shepherd's Tale was published by Simon & Schuster in 1839. The first edition of the book was published on September 14, 1839, in New York. The second edition was published two weeks later, on September 21, 1838, in London. The third edition was released on September 22, 1841, in Paris. The fourth edition was issued in New Orleans, New York, on October 1, 1842, in a book called The Shepherd’. The posse followed the trail of the robbers to a ranch where they bought two new horses. The dog was left at the ranch and the instructions of the Good Samaritan were repeated. The posse traveled both night and day, while pursuit must of necessity be by day only. The robbers kept to the outlying country was an advantage, yet the latter traveled both day and night. The marshal said that unless the earth opened and swallowed up the robbers they could not escape. The officer could not keep back the tears that came into his eyes as he lifted this dumb comrade of other victories to a horse. He brushed the incident away by assuring his posse that unless they opened the earth and swallowed the robbers up they would not be able to escape. He said: ""Now it became a hunt of man by man. Now it was a hunt for the life of the earth."" The marshals said: 'Now it was time to hunt the robbers by day and by night. And now it was the life and death of. The two men had been trying to find a place to camp for a day. They had been following a trail that led to a small town. The men were able to give a detailed description of the two men. The two men were eventually found and returned to the camp. The pair were then able to continue their journey to the town of Pueblo. The journey took them through a number of towns and villages. They eventually reached the town where they had been camping. They then returned to their camp to continue the journey. They were eventually able to return to the hotel where they were staying. The trip had taken them almost a day and a half to reach the town, which is about 20 miles from Puebla, Mexico. The town is known as Pueble de la Cruz and is located in the north of Mexico.. The pair had been travelling by night and day in the same direction. They had been in the middle of the night when they came to the town of Santa Fe. They were in the midst of the town when they were attacked by a group of men. The men were killed, but the men were able to escape to the north. They then continued their journey to the south, where they were met by the rest of the group. The group was able to continue on their way, but not before they had to stop for the night to rest. The next morning they were back on the road again, but this time they were not as far from the town. They continued on to the west, and were soon at the top of the mountain, but were stopped by the men again. They returned to the city, where the men had to wait until the next day for the men to arrive. They could not find the men, and the men could not be found.. Peg-Leg was on the run from the British army when he was spotted by a group of men. The men were searching for a man who had been killed in a raid on a bank. The man's body was found in the bank of a river, and the men were able to track him down. He was found to have been killed by the men, but his body had been found in a bank of water. He had been taken to a safe place, but the men could not find him and had to return to the bank. They had to wait until the next day for the men to return, but were not able to find him. He then had to go on his own, and was eventually found by the British Army. The story of his death was told in a book called 'The Great Escape', published in 1881. The book was about the adventures of the British soldier who was killed in the Battle of the Bulge.. Banks followed them one day farther, himself alone, leaving his tired companions at a station near the line of the Panhandle of Texas. This extra day's ride was to satisfy himself that the robbers were making for one of their haunts. They kept, as he expected, down between the two Canadians. After following the trail until he was thoroughly satisfied of their destination, the marshal retraced his steps and rejoined his posse. The first train carried him and the posse back to the headquarters of the express company. The posse had now been fourteen days on the trail. They had been followed by the robbers for 14 days. The robbers had been following them for fourteen days. They were following them because they had been caught. The robbery had taken place in Texas. The bandits had been tracked down to Oklahoma. The men had been captured by the authorities and were awaiting trial.. Peg Eldridge was tried in a Federal court in Colorado and convicted of train robbery. He went over the road for a term of years far beyond the lease of his natural life. He, with the companion captured at the same time, was taken by an officer of the court to Detroit for confinement. Peg was sullenly ignorant of anything. They were never captured, having separated before reaching the haunt of Mr. Eldridge. He was taken to Detroit by a court officer and held for confinement for years. Peg Eldridge died in prison in Detroit in 1881. He is buried in Detroit, along with his companion, who was also captured. He died of a heart attack in 1883. The story of his death is told in the book, ""The Great Train Robbery of 1881"". ""Will you please take this button back and give it, with my compliments, to that human bloodhound, and say to him that I'm sorry that I didn't anticipate meeting him?"" ""If I had, it would have saved you this trip with me,"" he said. ""He might have got me, but I wouldn't have needed a trial when he did."" ""I'm sorry I didn"""
0.6,0.7,51.053540587219345,"The Texas frontier has undergone few changes in the last half century, and no improvements have been made. The bandit and the robber feel equally at home under either flag. Within a dozen years of the close of the century just past, this territory was infested by a band of robbers, whose boldness has had few equals in the history of American brigandage. The frontier on the south has undergone little changes in a half century. The border between the Nueces and Rio Grande rivers in Texas has been the scene of many wars.. The bandits were Mexicans, a hybrid mixture of Spanish atrocity and Indian cruelty. They numbered from ten to twenty, and for several months terrorized the Mexican inhabitants on both sides of the river. On the American side they were particular never to molest any one except those of their own nationality. These they robbed with impunity, nor did their victims dare to complain to the authorities. The last and most daring act of these marauders was the kidnapping of Don Ramon Mora, owner of the princely grant of Agua Dulce. No one ever enjoyed the hospitality of AgUA Dulce but went his way with an increased regard for its owner and his estimable Castilian family.. Don Ramon had a pleasant home in one of the river towns. One June he and his family had gone to the ranch, intending to spend a few weeks there. He had notified cattle-buyers of this vacation, and had invited them to visit him there either on business or pleasure. One evening an unknown vaquero rode up to the Rancho and asked for Don Ramon. That gentleman presenting himself, the stranger made known his errand: a certain firm of well-known drovers, friends of the ranchero, were encamped for the night at a ranchita.. Don Ramon and his guide reached one of these thickets after nightfall. Suddenly they were surrounded by a dozen horsemen, who, with oaths and jests, told him that he was their prisoner. Relieving Don Ramon of his firearms and other valuables, one of the bandits took the bridle off his horse, and putting a rope around the animal's neck, the band turned towards the river with their captive. Near morning they went into one of their many retreats in the chaparral, fettering their prisoner, and returned to the ranchita.. The leader of these bandits held several conversations with him, asking in regard to his family, his children in particular, their names, number, and ages. What the feelings of Don Ramon Mora were that night is not for pen to picture, for they must have been indescribable. When evening came they set out once more southward, crossing the Rio Grande during the night at an unused ford. The next morning found them well inland on the Mexican side, and encamped in one of their many chaparral rendezvous.. The Mexican leader's family has opposed the freedom of Mexico for three generations. The leader of the band told the prisoner that their chief would join them by daybreak, and then he would know what his offense had been. ""Treason is unpardonable, Senor Mora,"" the chief said. ""It is useless to deny your guilt"" ""Treachery is unp pardonable,"" the leader said. 'Treason, Treason is a crime against human liberty' ""Treasons are a crime,"" the man said, ""against human liberty"" ""It's a crime to incite the ignorant to revolution and revolt against the native rulers"". ""Be in no hurry to execute these orders. Death is far too light a sentence to fit his crime"" ""Only take me before an established court that I may prove my innocence"" ""If you hope for mercy, it must come from there"" ""I will never forget you"" ""You are my only son"" ""My only son, I love you more than life"" ""Don't forget to bury me"" ""Never forget to forgive me"" 'I will always remember you' ""I am your son, my only child"". The family of Don Ramon were uneasy but not alarmed by his failure to return to them the day following his departure. The bandit leader alone offered little kindnesses. ""It is a fortunate thing that you are a man of means,"" he said to his victim. ""Come, don't despair, for I feel there is some hope,"" concluded the bandit. ""I am wealthy, but the money at my command is limited,"" he added. ""You will be taken to the hospital and you will be killed."" ""I will be given a new life,"" he told his victim, ""and I will give you. Don Ramon was reported missing by his wife after two days. A friend sent a letter to an old family friend for protection. A band of robbers had driven into a corral at a ranch and changed their horses. They left their own tired horses without so much as a hand raised in protest. Don Ramon's family were so terrified that they were unable to find him. They were left in a state of despair and helplessness. They had lost their only son, who had been killed in the battle. They also lost their daughter, who was taken by the enemy.. The letter concluded by advising them to meet any overture in strict confidence. As only money would be acceptable in such a case, the friend pledged all his means in behalf of Don Ramon should it be needed. The father, no doubt, would welcome death itself in preference to the rack on which he was kept by his captors. Time is not considered valuable in warm climates, and two weary days were allowed to pass before any conversation was renewed with DonRamon. Then once more the chief had the fetters removed from his victim's ankles, with the customary guard within call. The friend pledged to do anything in his power to help his friend.. Don Ramon was held captive by a band of men, five of whom were spies. He was told that he would have to pay at least fifty thousand dollars to be released. The men were poor, many had families, and if they accepted money, self-banishment was the only safe course. The political society to which they belonged would place a price on their heads if they were detected. Don Ramon asked his son if he could raise the money. He said that he had no time and freedom to raise the amount. The chief said that if he had, he could. But as it is, it is doubtful if I could command one fifth of it, he said.. ""If time were given him, possibly. Can I send him such a letter?"" pleaded Don Ramon, brightening with the hope of this new opportunity. ""It would be impossible at present. The consent of all interested must first be gained. Our responsibility then becomes greater than yours. No false step must be taken. There must be no dissenters to the plan or it fails, and then--well, the execution has been delayed long enough""Thus the days wore on. The absence of the band, except for the few who guarded the prisoner, was policy on their part.. Don Ramon Mora was a Spanish chief. He was accused of kidnapping a group of bandits for a ransom. Mora claimed that the men were the work of others and that he was sick of them. He offered them two thousand dollars for their freedom. He also pledged to refrain from prosecution. The men agreed to the offer. The incident occurred in the early 1800s. The story is told in the book ""The Ransom of Don Ramon"" (1905) by Don Ramiro Mora.. The vote asked for was watched by the prisoner as only a man could watch whose life hung in the balance. There were eight cane leaves to seven of the mesquite. The chief flew into a rage, cursed his followers for murderers for refusing to let the life blood run in this man, who had never done one of them an injury. He called them cowards for attacking the helpless, even accusing them of lack of respect for their chief's wishes. When he had finished his harangue, one of their number held up his hand to beg the privilege of speaking. ""Capitan,"" said the man, making obeisance and tapping his breast, ""there is an oath recorded. The chief led the prisoner back to his blanket, explaining that it was the mescal the men had drunk which made them so unreasonable and defiant. Promising to reason with them when they were more sober, he left Don Ramon with his solitary guard. The chief then returned to the band, where he received the congratulations of his partners in crime on his mock sympathy. It was agreed that the majority should be won over at the next council, which they would hold that evening. ""To the wind with your sympathy! To the gallows with our enemies!"" There was a chorus of ""brav. Don Ramon was held captive by the Spanish army. He was held in a prison in the town of San Marcos. He had been held captive since the start of the war. He has been held in the prison since the beginning of the conflict. He is being held in San Marcos with his wife and eight children. The majority of the people in the camp are against his release. They are afraid of him. He says that if he is released, he will give them all he has.. The chief ordered the band to meet again in three days at one of their rendezvous near Agua Dulce. He ordered them to go by twos, visit the river towns on the way, to pick up all items of interest, and particularly to watch for any movement of the authorities. The chief waited until the moon was well up, then abandoned their camp of the last ten days and set out towards Agua. Dulce, the chief's home town, was the site of a battle between the Indians and the Spanish.. Don Ramon was now furnished paper and pencil, and he addressed a letter to his son and family. It concluded with an appeal to secrecy, and an order to observe in confidence and honor any compact made, as his life and liberty depended on it. When this missive had passed the scrutiny of the bandits, it was dispatched by one of their number to Senora Mora. Reports which the members of the band brought to the chief showed that the authorities had made no movement as yet, so evidently this outrage had never been properly reported.. The messenger reached Agua Dulce an hour before midnight. He warned the inmates of his presence by the usual ""Ave Maria"" The son hastened into the house to read his father's communication. It was just two weeks since Don Ramon's disappearance, a fortnight of untold anguish and uncertainty to his family. The bandit kept a strict watch over the premises to see that no demonstration was made against him. When the half hour was nearly up, the son came forward and tendered the answer to the bandit's question.. The reply was first read by Don Ramon, then turned over to the chief. It would require a second letter, which was to be called for in four days. Things were now nearing the danger point. They must be doubly vigilant; so all but the chief and two guards scattered out and watched every movement. Two or three towns on the river were to have special care. The officers of the law were the most to be feared. Every bit of conversation overheard was carefully noted, with its effects and bearing. The chief cursed himself for letting his sympathy get the better of him.. The chief became very surly, often declaring that the case was hopeless; that the money could never be raised. Don Ramon heard these self-reproaches of the chief with a heavy heart, and when opportunity occurred, he pleaded for one more chance. ""I was a fool,"" said the chief, ""to listen to a condemned man's hopes, but having gone so far I might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb."" ""Write your son that if twice the sum named in his letter is not forthcoming within. The chief of a tribe in the Middle East demanded a ransom in exchange for his release. He took delight in hurling his venom on his helpless victim. He taunted his captive with the fact that he had always considered himself above his neighbors. The prisoner's questions as to where they were he received only insulting replies. His inquiries served only to suggest other cruelties. On this night the victim was blindfolded. One night they set out unusually early, the chief saying that they would recross the river before morning, so that if the ransom was not satisfactory, the execution might take place at. Don Ramon was a small man, and could offer no resistance to his captors. They cautioned him that the slightest resistance would mean death, while compliance to their wishes carried a hope of life. After many hours of riding--it was nearly morning when they halted--the bandage was removed from his eyes, and he was asked if he knew the place. ""Yes, it is Agua Dulce,"" he replied. ""I am Don Ramon."" ""I know the place,"" he said. ""It is a beautiful place."" ""Yes,"" he responded. ""That's where you are."". Don Ramon's wife bending over their baby's crib. His eyes flash defiance at the grinning fiends who exult at his misery. Death would have been preferable, not that life had no claims upon him, but that he no longer had hopes of liberty. The uncertainty was unbearable. The bandits exercised caution enough to keep all means of self-destruction out of his reach. The sun arose that morning, they were far away in one of the impenetrable thickets in which the country abounded. They were far from home, but the cry of a child was heard within the house.. The Texas Rangers were ordered to the Rio Grande by the governor of the State. The money was to be delivered at a certain abandoned ranchita at midnight. A squad of ten Texas Rangers disembarked at the nearest point on the railroad to this river village. The men seemed very few in number, but they were tried, experienced, fearless Rangers, from the crack company of the. State. There was no waste of time after leaving the train. There were no more prisoners to be killed. The Rangers were able to kill the last of the prisoners. They were not allowed to leave until they had killed all the prisoners in the village.. The story of the Mexican cowboys is one of the most famous in the world. The story is based on the true story of Don Ramon and his wife, who was killed in 1846. The tale was told by a lieutenant who was sent by his superior to investigate the case. He was told to go to the Agua Dulce ranch in the chaparral and ask for the wife of the ranch owner. The wife was reluctant at first, but eventually agreed to give him all the information he needed. The case was eventually solved by a team of Mexican soldiers who returned to the ranch.. The mother of the Ranger was waiting for her son to return. She asked him to bring a large sum of money, which was to be the ransom for his return. The money was to come from a man in a town twenty miles away. The man was a young man named Don Ramon, Jr., who was the son of a Ranger. The mother was waiting to see if her son would return. He did not. The woman was waiting. The boy was waiting in the town. The father was not returning. The son was not waiting for him to return, but to get food and clothing.. The abandoned ranchita in the monte--the meeting point--had been at one time a stone house of some pretensions. It had in previous years, however, been burned, so that now only crumbling walls remained. An hour after dark, a messenger, Don Ramon, Jr., and five Rangers set out to fulfill all contracts pending and understood. When the party arrived within two miles of the meeting point, an hour in advance of the appointed time, a halt was called. The party arrived at the appointed place and time, and the compact was adhered to.. The two men were led to the site by a guard of honour. They were told to stay silent and not to speak. The men were then led to a room where they were made to wait. They waited for the men to arrive. The moment they arrived, the men were taken to the room. The two men waited until the men arrived, and then they were taken away. The pair were then taken to a different room. They are still waiting for the man to arrive, but he has already arrived.. A fire flickered in the old fireplace, and around its circle gathered nine bandits to count and gloat over the blood money of their victim. Five Texas Rangers sprang through windows and doors, and without a word a flood of fire frothed from the mouths of ten six-shooters. Two of the bandits were found alive and untouched, having thrown themselves in a corner amid the confusion of smoke in the onslaught. Thus they were spared the fate of the others, though the ghastly sight of seven of their number, translated from life into death, met their terrorized  families. The bottle passed freely round the circle, and with toast and taunt and jeer the counting of the money was progressing."
0.49,0.59,41.97901049475262,"The first born was born in April of this year in Texas. He was born on a bed of young grass in a thicket near the Nueces River. He lay trembling on the grass, listening to his mother's mooing. He struggled to his knees, only to collapse like a limp rag when he heard a coyote's cry. He then tried to follow it, but was unable to get up. He eventually fell asleep, and was later found by his mother, who nursed him to health.. After several hours' sleep he was awakened by a strange twittering above him. The moon and stars, which were shining so brightly at the moment of his birth, had grown pale. He smelled of the rich green leaves of the mesquite, which hung in festoons about his birth chamber. He trampled underfoot the grass which carpeted the bower. After satisfying his appetite he was loath to lie down and rest, but must try his. A calf was nursed by his mother in a thicket. His mother wanted to go to the river to slake her thirst. She enticed him to a place where the grass in former years had grown rank. She cautioned him to be quiet during her enforced absence. But not once did he disobey her. The calf was later nursed and enjoyed his first sun bath. He was then nursed again and nursed for another day.. The calf was a dark red except for a white stripe which covered his face. The stripe extended from his ear to his hips. The calf was not disturbed by the incident, but was pleased to be with his mother. The pair went on to have a good day of grazing. The cowman was then taken to a nearby farm to graze his calf. The horse was not harmed, but the calf was left with a scar. The animal was later taken to hospital for treatment.. The author met a young cow and her first calf. The calf grew like a weed and had playmates on the hillsides. The cow's dam was a great crony of his own mother. The author's book, The Calf, is published by Simon & Schuster, at £16.99. For more information, visit the publisher's website, or go to www.simonandschuster.com.. Cows were almost inseparable during the entire summer. But late in the fall a number of horsemen scoured the hills and drove all the cattle down to the river. It was the first round-up he had ever been in, so he kept very close to his mother's side, and allowed nothing to separate him from her. Never during his life did the line-back calf forget that day. There was such a rush and hurrah among these horsemen that long before they reached the corrals the line back's tongue lolled out, for he was now a very fat. The line-back calf kept close to his mother's side, and as long as possible avoided the ropers. But in an unguarded moment the noose of a rope encircled one of his hind feet, and he was thrown upon his side. His mother followed him closely, but she was afraid of the men, and could only stand at a distance and listen to his piteous crying. The roper, when asked for the brand, replied, ""Bar-circle-bar,"" for that was the brand his. Calf was branding when he was a calf. Calf had a bleeding ear, seared side, and a hundred shooting pains in his loins. Owner asked if he wanted calf left for a bull. Owner said, ""No; yearlings will be worth fourteen dollars next spring. He's a first calf--his mother's only a three-year-old."" Calf was released from the fire, forlorn looking. He did not attempt to leave the corral until after darkness had settled over.. The boy was so thirsty he could smell the river. He crawled to the water and drank and drank. But every exertion tended to reopen his wounds. He was eventually able to walk again. The boy's mother had died of thirst. The child was left with his mother's body. He had to walk half a mile to reach the river, which was at least half amile away. The water laved his wounds, and he drank and drink. He eventually reached the river and drank some more.. The calf followed his dam back into the hills where grew the succulent grama grass which he loved. He met his speckled playmate again and the pair played together for more than a month. The line-back calf felt a change himself in the pleasant day's atmosphere. The sun now beat down on him fiercely, and he must seek some shady place for the day, but he started reluctantly to leave, and when he reached the shallows, he turned back to the comfort of the pool and drank again.. The calf and his playmate went along, outrunning their mothers. They traveled far into the night until they reached a chaparral thicket, south of the one in which he was born. It was well they sought its shelter, for two hours before daybreak a norther swept across the range. When day dawned a mist was falling which incrusted every twig and leaf in crystal armor. The one mysterious thing which bothered him was, how it was that his mother could always foretell when one was coming.. The two yearlings were the last to go, but one morning while feeding the line-back got a ripe grass burr in his mouth. The two cronies crossed the river and went up into the hills where they had ranged as calves the summer before. Within a week, at a lake which both well remembered, they met their mothers face-to-face. The story of the two calves is told in the novel, The Cattleman, by John McCaffery, published by Hodder & Stoughton, £16.99.. The steer was on the point of upbraiding his maternal relative for deserting him, when a cream-colored heifer calf came up and nourished itself at the cow's udder. That was too much for him. He understood now why she had left him, and he felt that he was no longer her baby. Piqued with mortification he went to a near-by knoll where the ground was broken, and with his feet pawed up great clouds of dust which settled on his back.. The pair met others of their kind from the Frio when out on those hills the summer before. They had found them decently behaved cattle. But after both had shed their winter coats, the speckled heifer was as pretty a two-year-old as ever. Without a moment's hesitation the line-back had accepted the challenge and had locked horns with this Adonis. Though he fought valiantly the battle is ever with the strong, and inch by inch he was forced backward.. Two-year-old heifer was caught by his rival and cut a cruel gash in his shoulder. He renounced kith and kin, the speckled heifer and the Nueces valley forever. He firmly resolved to start at once for the Frio country. He was a proud two-year old and had always held his head high. Could his spirit suffer the humiliation of meeting his old companions after such defeat?. The line-back steer had never witnessed such a procession of his kind before. He distinctly remembered the physical pain he had suffered once in a branding-pen, but that was nothing compared to this. He hardly knew which way to turn. Finally he concluded to lie down on a knoll and rest until nightfall, when he would start on his journey to the Frio. He was a cautious fellow; he knew he must have water on the way, and the rains had not yet fallen. The line- back steer saw something new, for coming over the brow of the hill was a great column of cattle.. The line-back steer classed them as strangers, probably bound for the Frio. When he attempted to join in, a dark-skinned man on a horse chased him away. Once again he tried to enter the herd, but an outrider cut him off. He would leave the Nueces valley with those cattle--or alone, it mattered not. He threw the very intensity of his existence into his resolution of the morning. He followed at a respectful distance.. The man was well mounted, and running his horse up to him he took up his tail, wrapped the brush around the pommel of his saddle, and by a dexterous turn of his horse threw him until he spun like a top. The ground was sandy, and while the throwing frightened him, never for an instant did it shake his determination. He complimented himself on his craftiness, but never dreamed that this was a trail herd, bound for some other. ""He swam rivers and grazed in contentment across flowery prairies, mesas and broken country. Yet it mattered nothing to him where he was going, for his every need was satisfied. These men with the herd were friendly to him, for they anticipated his wants by choosing the best grazing"" ""He also rejoiced that every hour carried him farther and farther from the Nueces valley, where he had suffered so much physical pain and humiliation"" ""The provincial ideas of his youth underwent a complete change within the first month of trail life"". The Red Man was conquered, and, daily, the skulls of the buffalo, his predecessors, stared vacantly into his face. When he swam Red River with the leaders of the herd, he not only bade farewell to his native soil, but burned all bridges behind him. To the line-back steer, existence on the Nueces had been very simple. But now his views were broadening. Was not he a unit of millions of his kind, all forging forward like brigades of a king's army to possess themselves of some unconquered country?. 15 strays were turned loose in the Coldwater Pool, one of the large pastures in the Strip. One of these strays was a line-back, bar-circle-bar, two-year-old steer. When fifteen of them had been cut out and the buyer asked the trail foreman if he was willing to include them in the bill of sale, the latter smilingly replied: ""Not on your life, Captain. You can't keep them out of a herd"". Dick Larkin had just ten beans left when he offered to cut a card with any man to see who took his steer. The other players languidly returned to the table. Larkin cut a five spot of clubs and was in the act of tearing it in two, when Tex turned the tray of spades. On the turn of a low card, the line-back steer passed into the questionable possession of Dick Larkin.. The Cherokee Strip wrought magic in a Texas steer. One or two winters in its rigorous climate transformed the gaunt long-horn into a marketable beef. The line-back steer met the rigors of the first winter and by June was as glossy as a gentleman's silk tile. But at that spring round-up there was a special inspector from Texas, and no sooner did his eye fall upon the bar-circle-bar steer than he opened his book and showed the brand. There was no going back on that, and the Texas man took the line- back steer.. The line-back steer was one of nearly 2,000 cattle that were rounded up in the winter. He was taken to Kansas for pasturage. How he escaped is never known. The cattle were taken to a new pasture in the same area of the state. The herd was eventually rounded up and put to pasture. The animals were later put to good use in the fields.. The line-back pilot-wheel steer had changed owners no less than five times. The bar-circle-bar had somehow changed, until now it was known as the pilot wheel. The steer was taken by a man from Black Bear, Texas, and given to Richard Larkin. Larkin gave the new owner the history of the steer. He told him that the brand was of record in McMullen County, Texas. He warned him of special inspectors, and gave him other necessary information.. Coldwater Pool cattle had been seen on the Salt Fork range. Larkin and another lad went up to a beef round-up. Almost the first steer Bold Richard laid his eyes on was an under-bit, line-back. Larkin swore by all the saints he would know that steer in Hades. But Abner Taylor knew he dared not ship him to a market. There was another chance open, however. The next spring the line- back steer was a five-year-old.. Fant had wintered the cattle with which to fill this contract on his Salt Fork range in the Cherokee Strip. The wintry herd of beeves were grazed across to Fort Peck in little less than three months. On reaching the agency, the cattle were in fine condition and ready to issue to the Indian wards of our Christian nation. In the very first allotment from this herd the line-back beef was cut off with thirty others. It was fitting that he should die in his prime.. The line-back caught the horse with his horn and disemboweled him. The pilot-wheel steer staggered back and made several efforts to gore the dying horse and helpless rider. With a dozen shots through his vitals, he sank down and expired. Abner Taylor, witnessing the incident, rode over to a companion and inquired: ""Did you notice my line- back poker steer play his last trump?"""

The Wolf had such a beautiful vision of his coming happiness that he almost wept. But just then he noticed that the hair on the Dog's neck was worn and the skin was chafed. ""Perhaps you see the mark of the collar to which my chain is fastened,"" said the Dog.. ""Not always! But what's the difference?"" replied the Dog.

But not half-way, near a clump of trees, there was the Wolf! ""Please, Mr. Wolf,"" he said trembling, ""I know you are going to eat me. But first please pipe me a tune, for I want to dance and be merry as long as I can."" The Wolf liked the idea of a little music before eating, so he struck up a merry tune and the Kid leaped and frisked gaily. The Kid's story is told in the book ""The Kid and the Wolf"" by John McCaffery, published by Simon & Schuster.. The Shepherd Dogs pricked up their ears. They recognized the song the Wolf sings before a feast. The Wolf's song ended suddenly, and as he ran, with the Dogs at his heels, he called himself a fool for turning piper to please a Kid, when he should have stuck to his butcher's trade."

""I shall read it,"" said the little girl. ""For I like dreams, and have a great many curious ones myself"" ""I'm afraid something will happen to you, as it did to him, if you don't care for dear Christmas,"". Effie poked discontentedly among the sweeties for something worth eating. ""Why are you tired of what should be the happiest time of all the year?"" asked mamma, anxiously. ""Perhaps I shouldn't be if I had something new. But it is always the same, and there isn't any more surprise about it,"" she said. ""I always find heaps of goodies in my stocking. Don't like some of them, and soon get tired of those I do like"" ""We always have a great dinner, and I eat too much, and feel ill. ""I've had so many Christmases all alike that I don't think I can bear another one,"" said Effie. ""Suppose we don't give you any presents at all,--how would that suit you?"" asked mamma, anxious to please her spoiled child.

""You can, and I will,"" she replied. ""But first, let's go to the library and read a bit of ""A Christmas Carol"". Effie's nurse, Nursey, told her a fairy tale before bedtime. Effie laughed and cried over many parts of the charming story, and felt better without knowing why. Nursey told her best tales; and when at last the child lay down under her lace curtains, her head was full of a curious jumble of Christmas elves, poor children, snow-storms, sugarplums, and surprises. So it is no wonder that she dreamed all night; and this was the dream, which she never quite forgot. She found herself sitting on a stone, in the middle of a great field, all alone. She was alone, and she had no one to talk to. She had no idea what had happened.. Effie felt hungry, cold, and tired, and did not know where to go nor what to do. The snow was falling fast, a bitter wind whistled by, and night was coming on. Faster fell the snow, colder blew the wind, darker grew the night. The tears were chilled on her cheeks, her feet felt like icicles, and her heart died within her, so hungry, frightened, and forlorn was she. She made up her mind that she was quite forgotten and left to freeze alone. She was a beggar-girl, and now I am one; but I don't like it, and wish somebody. Effie was lost in the snow when she heard the sound of a child's voice. She tried to run toward the welcome glimmer, but could not stir. ""I will go anywhere with you. Don't leave me again,"" cried Effie, gladly. ""First I will make you comfortable. That is what we love to do"" ""Will you come and see how we work?"" asked Effie. ""Yes,"" said the little girl. ""That is what I love most of all"" ""I love you too,"" said Effie; ""I'll go anywhere"" ""Yes, I will,"" replied the little child. ""Don't go away."". ""I will feed you; sorrowful, and I will make you gay,"" said the angel. ""You are cold, and you shall be warm, hungry,"" he said. ""I will make your troubles forgotten in a minute"" ""You will be warm and hungry, and your troubles will be forgotten,"" he promised. ""And I will feed your sorrowful troubles in a moment,"" he added, ""and make your gay troubles forgotten"" ""And all the world will be a new world,"" said Effie, ""with bells ringing and lights blazing"" ""Yes,"" replied the angel, ""it will be,"" and the world was a new, warm world. ""A new world"" was the world of Christmas. ""It will be full of wonders,"" he told Effie.. ""Please tell me what splendid place this is?"" asked Effie, as soon as she could collect her wits after the first look at all these astonishing things. Older and graver spirits were looking over piles of little books, in which the records of the past year were kept. Some got peace, some disappointment, some remorse and sorrow, some great joy and hope. The rich had generous thoughts sent them; the poor, gratitude and contentment. Children had more love and duty to parents; and parents renewed patience, wisdom, and satisfaction for and in their children. No one was forgotten. ""This is the Christmas world; and here we work all the year round, never tired of getting ready for the happy day,"" said a spirit. ""These are the saints just setting off; for some have far to go, and the children must not be disappointed."". ""Why, I thought there was only one Santa Claus, and even he was a humbug,"" cried Effie, astonished at the sight. ""Never give up your faith in the sweet old stones, even after you come to see that they are only the pleasant shadow of a lovely truth,"" said the spirit. ""You will like to see this place, I think, and may learn something here perhaps,"" he said. ""I never will say there isn't any Santa Claus again,"" said Effie. ""Now, show me more."" ""Yes,"" replied the spirit, ""and I'll show you more."". ""I saw that in some ways the dolls improved upon the manners and customs of human beings,"" writes the author. ""A fine Paris doll driving in her carriage took up a black worsted Dinah who was hobbling along with a basket of clean clothes, and carried her to her end"" ""I once knew a rich girl who didn't give her things to poor girls,"" says the author, ""and it seems to me I once knew one who did."" ""I saw a girl who did not give things to the poor, but gave them to the rich,"" adds the writer. ""And I saw a woman who gave her things, and she did not do it to me,"" she adds. ""I think I know why."". ""I wish I could remember who she was, and tell her to be as kind as that china doll,"" said Effie, much touched at the sweet way the pretty creature wrapped up the poor fright. ""We recall these things to people's minds by dreams. I think the girl you speak of won't forget this one,"" said the spirit. And the spirit smiled, as if he enjoyed some joke which she did not see. ""They know their lessons very well, and are as still as mice,"" she said. ""And we make a great racket at our school, and get bad marks every day,"" she added, ""but they are so good at their work."". ""I've seen ever so many,"" began Effie, thinking of her own Christmases. ""No, you have never seen what I will show you,"" said the spirit. ""You have seen how we prepare for Christmas; let me show you where we love best to send our good and happy gifts,"" answered the spirit, giving her his hand again. ""Now, show me something else,"" she said, as they came again to the low door that led out of Doll-land. ""I shall tell the girls they had better mind what they do, or their dolls will be better scholars than they are,"" said Effie as she peeped in and saw no rod in the hand of the little mistress, who looked up and shook her head.. ""Come away, and remember what you see to-night,"" Effie says. ""The world vanished, and Effie found herself in a part of the city she had never seen before"" ""It was down among the dingy streets where the poor lived, and where there was no making ready for Christmas"" ""Hungry women looked in at the shabby shops, longing to buy meat and bread, but empty pockets forbade. ""Don't they have any in this place?"" asked Effie, shivering, as she held fast the spirit's hand, following where he led her. ""We come to bring it. Let me show you our best workers."" And the spirit pointed to some sweet-faced men and women who came stealing into the poor houses, working such beautiful miracles that Effie could only stand and watch. Some slipped money into the empty pockets, and sent the happy mothers to buy all the comforts they needed. Others led the drunken men out of temptation, and took them home to find safer pleasures there. Fires were kindled on cold hearths, tables spread as if by magic, and warm clothes wrapped round shivering limbs. The spirit said, ""I will show you what it is to be a good person. You can be anything you want to be."". ""That is so beautiful! I wish I could make merry Christmases as these good people do, and be loved and thanked as they are,"" said Effie, softly, as she watched the busy men and women do their work and steal away. ""You can if you will. I have shown you the way,"" she said. ""I will not let you go without a reward."" ""I have shown them the way, and they will follow it,"" she replied. ""They will not go without. They will go with me, and I will not stop them."" ""You have shown me the way. I will follow you."". ""Darling, wake up, and tell me why you are smiling in your sleep,"" said a voice in her ear. ""You have been dreaming at a great rate,"" said mamma. ""Try it, and see how happy your own holiday will be hereafter,"" said the spirit. ""Oh, stay and show me more!"" cried Effie, trying to hold him fast. ""Wasn't it splendid?"" she asked, rubbing her eyes, and looking about her for the pretty child who was so real and sweet. ""Tell me what was so splendid,"" saidmamma, smoothing the tumbled hair and. ""The spirit said I could work lovely miracles if I tried,"" said Effie. Nursey thought it very wonderful; but mamma smiled to see how curiously things the child had thought, read, heard, and seen through the day were mixed up in her sleep. Then, while she was being dressed, Effie told her dream, and Nursey Thought it very Wonderful. But when she heard Effie's story, she thought it was very wonderful, too. But then she remembered the adventures of the past night. And clapping her hands, Mamma suddenly began to dance all over the room as if she. ""Tell me! tell me!"" shrieked Effie. ""No, no; it is a surprise,--a grand surprise for Christmas day!"" sung mamma. ""Now, come to breakfast; for we must work like bees if we want to play spirits tomorrow"" ""You and Nursey will go out shopping, and get heaps of things, while I arrange matters behind the scenes."" ""There will be no tree, no party, no dinner, in this house at all, and no presents for you"" ""It won't be a surprise; for I know you are going to ask some poor children here, and have a tree or something"". ""Do it. I shall like it, I think; and I won't ask any questions, so it will all burst upon me when the time comes,"" she said. And she ate her breakfast thoughtfully, for this really would be a new sort of Christmas. Parcel after parcel was sent home; but when Effie returned she saw no trace of them, though she peeped everywhere. All that morning Effie trotted after Nursey. ""Is the surprise going on all right?"" asked Effie, anxiously. Nursey chuckled, but wouldn't give a hint, and went out again in the afternoon with a long list of more things to buy. Effie wandered forlornly about the house, missing the usual merry stir that went before the Christmas dinner and the evening fun. She was so tired that she could only lie on the sofa to rest, smiling as if some very pleasant thought made her happy in spite of her weariness.. The next day there was no stocking to examine, no pile of gifts under her napkin, no one said ""Merry Christmas!"" to her, and the dinner was just as usual to her. Nursey kept wiping her eyes and saying: ""The dear things! It's the prettiest idea I ever heard of. No one but your blessed ma could have done it."" ""Do stop, Nursey, or I shall go crazy because I don't know the secret!"" cried Effie, more than once; and she kept her eye on the clock, for at seven in the evening the surprise was to come off. ""I know you will like it, dear, and long remember this new way of making Christmas merry,"" said Nurse.. ""I feel like the girls in the fairy tales who are led off to strange places and see fine things,"" said Nursey. ""Do just as I tell you, and don't say one word whatever you see,"" said Effie. ""I will tell you all about it, and you will see it too,"" she said, as she led him to a room with a box full of gifts. ""It is like a fairy tale,"" she added, ""but with a twist of reality."" ""I'll tell you about it all,"" she replied, ""and you'll see it, too."" ""Yes,"" she agreed. ""Yes, I will,"" she answered. ""You'll see."". ""So you do; and that's the part you are to play, my pretty! Now whist, while I blind your eyes and put you in your place."" ""Why, Nursey, I look like the spirit in my dream!"" she said. ""Oh!"" she replied. ""I look like a girl in a dream!"" ""I'm not a girl, I'm a woman!"" ""Yes, you are, you're a woman."" ""You're not a woman, you've got to be a woman"" ""I am a woman,"" she said, ""and I'm going to be your wife."". ""Now, my precious, look and see how you and your dear ma have made a merry Christmas for them that needed it!"" Nurse clapped her hands. Effie really did think she was asleep again, for she actually stood in ""a grove of Christmas trees,"" all gay and shining as in her vision. Twelve on a side, in two rows down the room, stood the little pines, each on its low table. Behind Effie a taller one rose to the roof, hung with wreaths of popcorn, apples, oranges,. ""How splendid! Who is it for? Where is mamma?"" asked one of the children. ""Before Nurse could answer, the doors at the lower end flew open, and in marched twenty-four little blue-gowned girls,"" said Effie. ""So my girl wanted to be a Christmas spirit too, and make this a happy day for those who had not as many pleasures and comforts as she has,"" said the mother. ""And we planned this for you all,"" she said. ""We wanted to make you all happy and happy together."" ""And so we did,"" she added, ""and it was a wonderful day for all of us,"" said her daughter. ""It was a very special day for us all,"" added Effie, ""but it was also a very sad day for some of the other children. ""She shall play the good fairy, and give each of you something from this tree"" ""She shall give you oranges, red apples, bunches of grapes, bonbons, and cakes, till all were gone"" ""And then each was led to her own tree by the mamma with all their hearts"" ""The happy hubbub that arose would have satisfied even Santa Claus himself"" ""We will all be happy when we are all together again"" ""Let's all have a good time together"" ""I will give you something to eat"" ""You can have something to drink"" ""Don't take anything from the tree, just give it to us"" ""It's a good idea to give people something to say"" ""A good thing to say is that you want to make people happy"". ""I don't think heaven can be any gooder than this,"" sighed one small girl, as she looked about her in a blissful maze. ""Is that a truly angel up there?"" asked another, fascinated by the little white figure with the wreath on its shining hair. ""I wish I dared to go and kiss her for this splendid party,"" said a lame child, leaning on her crutch. ""How they peeped and tasted, pulled and pinched, until the air was full of queer noises,"" said another. ""The floor covered with papers, and the little trees left bare of all but candles,"" said one. ""It was a wonderful day, and I'm so glad I. Lame Katy felt as if ""a truly angel"" was embracing her, and could only stammer out her thanks. The other children ran to see the pretty spirit, and touch her soft dress, until she stood in a crowd of blue gowns laughing as they held up their gifts for her to see and admire. The girls fell into line, and marched before Effie and mamma again, to say goodnight with such grateful little faces that the eyes of those who looked grew dim with tears. ""Too much fun is a mistake,"" said Effie. ""I only dreamed about it"" said the little girl. ""You may; but mammas deserves the thanks. She did it all; I only dreamedAbout it"". ""Mamma, it was a beautiful surprise, and I thank you so much! I don't see how you did it, but I like it best of all the Christmases I ever had"" ""I will,"" answered Effie, and held it fast until the last smiling face was gone, and she safe in her own bed, too tired and happy for anything but sleep. ""Do keep that; it's the prettiest thing I got."" ""I'll keep it, too. Do keep it."" ""Do you want to keep it?"" ""Yes, of course. ""I had my splendid big present, and here is the dear little one to keep for love of poor Katy; so even that part of my wish came true,"" she said. ""And Effie fell asleep with a happy smile on her lips, her one humble gift still in her"

""A handful of good is worth a bushel of learning,"" she writes. ""I'm going to make it a real old-fashioned frolic, and won't you come and help me?"". The writer of the above wrote to the author of this article. The writer was a young woman who had recently moved to the country. The letter was sent to the writer's friend, SOPHIE VAUGHAN. It was sent in the form of a telegram to the editor of this newspaper.. Sophie was on the threshold of the house when she saw Saul. Saul was piling wood into the big oven, and she always enjoyed the sight of this stalwart cousin, whom she likened to a Norse viking. Saul pitched in his last log, looking ready to put a girdle round the earth in less than forty minutes.. ""I shall be afraid of 'em, but I'll try not to make you ashamed of me,"" said Ruth, who loved her charming cousin even more than she admired her. Aunt Plumy leaned on the rolling-pin to smile and nod with a shrewd twinkle of her eye, as if she enjoyed the prospect as much as Sophie did. Sophie: ""He is a true gentleman in spite of his airs and elegance, and he will take it all in good part, if you treat him like a man and not a lion"" Saul:. ""They shall do their parts and not be a trouble,"" said the old woman. ""I'll see to that, for you certainly are the dearest aunt in the world to let me take possession of you and yours in this way"" The old woman's hands were too floury to do. Sophie's plan grew apace, for Ruth longed to see a real novelist and a fine lady. Aunt Plumy, having plans of her own to further, said ""Yes, dear,"" to every suggestion. As it could not be done, he fled temptation. Sophie and Saul were travelling to their cousin's home at the end of the year. The snowfall was a perfect excuse to get out the double sleigh and span. Sophie insisted that the old yellow sleigh, with. ""She has not come for us, and there is not even a stage to take us up,"" said the little girl. ""She will come soon,"" said her father, ""and she will be. ""That is the never-to-be-forgotten face of our fair friend, but the bonnet of her grandmother, if my eyes do not deceive me,"" answered Randal.. Sophie and Randal are travelling in a sleigh with a large trunk and valise. They meet Saul, who looks calm and comely, taciturn and tall. ""Saul doesn't live in a glass house, so stones won't hurt him,"" says Sophie. ""He should have been named Samson or Goliath,"" says Randal.. ""He has no small vices, but you may indulge yours,"" said Sophie. ""What a daisy the sister is. Does she ever speak?"" asked Randal. ""Oh yes, and sings like a bird,"" replied Emily.. ""I should expect to be annihilated by the big brother if I attempted any but the 'sincerest' admiration and respect,"" said Sophie.

""Are you troubled with dyspepsy,.

""I cannot help 'picking folks to pieces,' as you have expressed it,"" he writes. ""People like the 'spice-bread,' and as that is the only sort my oven will bake, I must keep on in order to make my living"". ""Upon my soul, I don't know myself. It is very hard to find new finales. Can't you suggest something, Major? then I shall not be obliged to leave my story without an end, as people complain I am rather fond of doing"" ""I can't decide whether he is going to spoil his life marrying that silly woman, or do something grand and generous, and not be. ""Tell us one of them, and I'll bless you for a hint,"" said Randal. ""No one knows the anguish of an author's spirit when he can't ring down the curtain on an effective tableau,"" he added.. ""Any man can be brave when the battle-fever is on him, and it only takes a little physical courage to dash ahead,"" he said. He paused a moment, with his eyes on the snowy landscape without, where twilight was deepening. ""That was a thrilling story, I assure you,"" answered Sophie, with an inviting smile.. ""I was calculating how I'd manage, when I found two poor chaps close by who were worse off, so I braced up and did what I could for them. One had an arm blown away, and kept up a dreadful groaning. The other was shot bad, and bleeding to death for want of help, but never complained. He was nearest. Saul's eyes turned to the beloved face with a glance of tenderest affection, and Aunt Plumy answered with a dismal groan at the recollection of his need that night, and her absence. ""We always want mother when we are down, you know,"" he said.. ""I'll never forget that night. I dream it all over again as plain as if it was real,"" he said. ""Snow, cold, darkness, hunger, thirst, pain, and all round us cries and cursing growing less and less, till at last only the wind went moaning over that meadow. It was awful!"". ""He suffered all the pains we most shrink from without a murmur,"" says author. ""He kept my heart warm while his own was growing cold"" ""He had one chance and gave it cheerfully,"" she says. ""I've read books, heard sermons, and seen good folks, but. ""I saw how faith could hold a soul up when everything was gone but God"" ""I heard prayers that night that meant something,"" he said. ""I never should have waked up if it hadn't been for Joe"" ""The cold sort of numbed me, and I dropped off, too weak and stupid to think or feel"". ""It was very noble, very touching. And you? How did you get off at last?"" asked Randal, with real admiration and respect in his usually languid face. ""Crawled off,"" answered Saul, relapsing into his former brevity.. Sophie and her friend had often heard Randal talk, for he was an accomplished raconteur. They sat late and were very merry, for Aunt Plumy got up a little supper for them. When they parted for the night and Sophie kissed her aunt, Emily did the same, saying heartily, ""It seems as if I'd known you. ""But it ain't all fun, as you'll find out to-morrow when you go. ""You do 'keep it up' in earnest, upon my word, and very becoming it is, dear it is,"" says the old lady. ""You do keep it up"" is a good old hymn, says the young lady, who has been learning to fry buckwheats.. ""I like it, and really believe I've found my proper sphere at last,"" says Sophie. ""I find it difficult to imagine, and shrink from the thought of the wide-spread dismay such a fate will produce among her adorers,"" adds Randal. ""She might do worse; but come to breakfast and do honor to my handiwork,"". ""I feel equal to almost anything, so let me help wash cups,"" said Emily, with unusual energy"
0.79,0.89,45.13184584178499,"A certain fine old lady was seventy-three on the 8th of October. The day was always celebrated with splendor by her children and grand-children. Some families do not celebrate these days, and so miss a great deal of pleasure, I think. The tea-table was ornamented with a splendid cake, white as snow outside, but rich and plummy inside, with a gay posy stuck atop of the little Mont Blanc. It was very pleasant, and the bright autumn day was a little harvest time for the old lady, who had sowed love and charity broadcast with no thought of any reward. Mrs. Curnow was a kind and generous woman, and her family were proud to call her their mother. She was a very special woman, who was a great help to many people.. The boys vanished directly after tea, and shouts of laughter were heard from Aunt Tribulation's room. What larks as they had up there no one knew, but every one was sure they were preparing some fun in honor of the occasion. Presently something scarlet and gold, feathery and strange, flitted by the door and vanished in the study. Queer little yells and the sound of dancing feet were heard. Then all the lamps were collected there, leaving grandma and grandpa to sit in the parlor, talking tenderly together by the soft glimmer of fire-light, as they used to do forty years ago. It was so pretty all voted not to cut it till evening, for the table was full of other good things. The family gifts were not yet given.. Aunt Trib followed, escorted by Thomas Pib, the great cat, with his best red bow on. Mrs. Trot and Belinda, the little maid, brought up the rear. A music-box in the hall played the ""Grand March"" from ""Norma;"" and, with great dignity, all filed into the study to behold an imposing spectacle. ""Aunt Carmine"" was over the water and could not come, so, at grandma's desire, her portrait was borne in the procession. ""Grandpa"" was escorted to the scene of glory by his wife.. An arch of red woodbine, evergreen and ferns from the White Mountains was made over the recess which held the journals, letters and books of the family. The family all wrote so much that blots were found everywhere about the house, and a flock of geese lived in the back yard. The father of grandma had been laid, a new-born baby, and nearly smothered by. The boys had planned to paint their faces blue and red, like the Feejee Islanders at Barnum's show; but Mrs. Barnum had already painted their faces. The boys were delighted when they found out that their great-grandpa had been killed in the accident. They were also delighted to find out that they had been able to dress up as Indian warriors for the occasion. They had made their own spears and war-clubs, and had sewed hen's feathers on to their shirts and leggings. They also had a set of Chinese lanterns and army blankets to wear as war-bodies.. Every gift had a poem attached, and as the presents were of every description, the verses possessed an agreeable variety. A small tea-kettle was one gift, and this pleasing verse seemed to be bubbling out of its spout. Another was this brief warning tucked into a match-box:— “Don't mess up your tea!’” Another was rather sentimental, from Mrs. Coobiddy:—“Mr. Coobs, don't mess with my pretty little boys!”“I’ve got a present for you, my dear.”.. Pib was so fat and big that he could no longer catch the mice who dodged about among the dishes in the kitchen closets. Pib presented a mouse-trap all set; and in order to explain his poem, I must relate an incident in his varied career. The poem was written by Pib's friend, the poet and playwright, John Keats. The story is based on a true incident. The author has no connection with the story. The poet and the playwright are friends and family. The writer has no relationship with the family, and the poem is not based on the story of Pib.. Pib was so depressed that he went into the bag without a mew or a scratch, and was borne away to his new home in another part of the town. But he had no intention of staying; and after a day under the sofa, passed in deep thought, and without food or drink, he made up his mind to go home. It was a most exciting spectacle; for after the dance came a fight, and one chief tomahawked, scalped, and buried the other in the space of two minutes. But the ladies mourned so for the blond little Pockeyhockeyclutteryar that he had to come alive and join in a hunting expedition, during which they shot all the chairs for buffaloes and deer, and came home.. The queen of the fête cut the cake with much scuffling of big moccasins and tripping over disarranged blankets. After which the entire company took hands and danced about the big chair, singing in chorus. The clock struck ten, and every one went home, leaving the family to end the day as they began it, round grandma's bed, with good-night kisses and the sound of her last words in their ears: ""It has been a beautiful and happy day, my"
0.65,0.75,48.61686268013914,"Johnny Morris lived in a little court that led off from one of the busiest streets in the city. The court was a dull place, with only two or three shabby houses in it. The people who hurried by were too busy to do more than to glance at the lame boy who sat in the sunshine against the wall. He would have answered, ""The sun and the wind, next to mother."". A bad fall left Johnny with a broken back. He could no longer run errands, help with the heavy tubs, or go to school. But he was a happy boy, in spite of the pain. He enjoyed the wind and the sun more than anything else. He was happy to be a cripple, but he was also happy to have his books and pictures. He would sit in the sun and read. He loved the wind. He liked the sun. He hated the rain. But the sun made him happy, and the wind made him feel better. He had a happy life, and he was grateful for it. He is happy to die.. Faces, animals, people, and big letters, all came to cheer the boy, who was never tired of collecting these waifs and strays. He cut out the big pictures to paste on the wall with the leavings of mother's starch, and the smaller in the scrap-book he made out of stout brown wrappers or newspapers. Soon it was a very gay wall; for mother helped, standing on a chair, to put the large pictures up, when Johnny had covered all the space he could reach. The white cat that sat on the. wall was Puss in Boots to him, or Whittington's good friend.. The boy was sure some lovely creature lived in that garden, and he longed to get in to find and play with her. He actually planted a bean in a bit of damp earth behind the water-barrel, and watched it grow, hoping for as strong a ladder as Jack's. But the story he liked best was the ""Sleeping Beauty in the Wood;"". ""Faix, and I will, thin,"" says Patsey Morris. ""The board broke, and splash went the climber,"" says Johnny. ""After this sad event Pat kept away for a time in high dudgeon,"" says the author. ""Johnny was more lonely than ever,"" adds Patsey. ""I was so impatient that he promised Patsey his best book ""for his ownty-donty,"" if he would climb up and report what was to be seen in that enchanted garden,"" adds the author of ""The Secret Garden"". Johnny heard a sweet voice singing in the enchanted garden. Sparrows were chirping gayly everywhere. A white cat, with a fresh blue bow, basked on the coping of the wall. Johnny smiled as he listened, and put his finger to the little dent in his own chin, wishing the singer would finish this pleasing song. But she never did, though he often heard that, as well as other childish ditties, sung in the same gay voice, with bursts of laughter and the sound of lively feet.. Johnny longed intensely to know who the singer was. For her music cheered his solitude, and the mysterious sounds he heard in the garden increased his wonder and his longing day by day. Sometimes a man's voice called, ""Fay, where are you?"" and Johnny. A delicious fragrance was now wafted over the wall as of flowers, and the poor boy imagined untold loveliness behind that cruel wall. Canaries carolled, and some elfish bird scolded, screamed, and laughed so like a human being, that Johnny felt sure that magic of some sort was at work next door. Once his eager eyes caught glimpses of a little creature, all blue and white and gold, who peeped out from the green fans, and nodded, and tried to toss him a cluster of chestnut flowers.. Johnny was so delighted he forgot his crutches. He stretched his hands to her with speechless delight. He would have fallen if he had not caught by the shutter of a window. When he could look up again, the fairy had vanished. Nothing was to be seen but the leaves dancing in the wind. He never forgot it, and was thinking of it as he sat staring at the wall on that memorable May day. He said to himself, ""How I should like to peek in and see just how it all really looks!"". Johnny was inspired by the story of Monte Cristo. He decided to try to climb through a hole in the wall to get a glimpse of the play's hero. His mother smiled at his energy, then sighed and said, as she clapped her laces with a heavy heart, ""Ah, poor dear, if he only had his health he'd make his way in the world"" The story was about a man who climbs through a wall ten feet thick with a rusty nail and a broken knife to get to the other side.. ""Turn again, Whittington, Lord Mayor of London."" ""Hail, the conquering hero comes!"" ""Puss, in her white boots, sat aloft and looked on, wise as the cat in the story, but offered no advice"" ""But now he's like to find a blank wall before him while he lives, and none to help him over"" ""Turn again,"" said the toad, ""and I'll show you how to do it."" ""And I'll tell you what to do,"" said Puss, and the boy did.. ""It's all right,"" said Johnny, with a long sigh of pleasure; ""that's the Sleeping Beauty, sure enough"" A bed of splendid tulips tossed their gay garments in the middle of a grass-plot; a strange and brilliant bird sat dressing its feathers on a golden cage; a little white dog dozed in the sun; and on a red carpet under the trees lay the. ""Oh, if I could only go in and eat 'em and read 'em,"" thought the poor boy. ""I felt shut out from all the splendid things,"" he thought. ""Oh, I could go in!"" he said, ""and eat ' them and read them and speak to 'em"" ""I would go in, and eat them!"" said the boy, ""but I could not go in."" ""I could not eat them,"" said the girl, ""because they were too good to eat."" ""Oh!"" said Johnny, ""I'd go in! But I couldn't!"". Johnny tied a long string to his gayest poster, and then fastening it to the pole with which he sometimes fished in the water-cask. He held it up to catch the fresh breezes blowing down the court. ""I can't go and wake her like the Prince did, but I do wish she'd get up and do something, now I can see"". The wind caught the paper and sent it flying over the wall. The Princess clapped her hands when Pippo brought the picture for her to see. ""She likes it! I'm so glad. Wish I had some more to send over,"" he said. The old woman, with a long yawn, went away, carrying her distaff, like a gun, over her shoulder. ""I'm sorry I didn't have more. Johnny tore from the wall his most cherished picture, a gay flower-piece, just put up; and folding it, he thrust it through the hole and waited to see what followed. Nothing but a rustle, a bark, and a queer croak from the splendid bird, which set the canaries to trilling sweetly. And he began to whistle like a mocking-bird; for this was his one accomplishment, and he was proud of it.. ""She likes the hole! I wonder if she will like me?"" Johnny took another peep. This was the most delicious one of all. He looked right into a great blue eye, with glimpses of golden hair above, a little round nose in the middle, and red lips below. ""Oh! I can see the street. How nice! how nice!"" he said. ""Come, Pippo, let us go and find him."". Johnny Morris was like a flash of sunshine, and Johnny winked, as if dazzled. The pretty mouth broke into a laugh as the voice cried out delightedly. ""I see some one! Come and tell me!"" The Princess graciously expressed her pleasure by saying, ""I like it; you shall do it again, by and by"" Johnny obeyed, and when he paused, out of breath, a small hand came through the hole, grasping as many lilies as it could hold.. ""Porverino!"" sighed the little voice, full of pity. Three red-and-yellow tulips fell at Johnny's feet. ""Oh, thank you! Aren't they just elegant? I never see such beauties,"" stammered the poor boy, grasping his treasures. ""You shall have as many as you like. Nanna will scold, but papa won't mind. Tell me more. Are you a nice. ""If you like pictures, you shall come and see mine some day. I do a great many. Papa shows me how. Do you draw or paint yours?"" ""I only cut 'em out of papers, and stick 'em on this wall or put 'em in scrap-books. I can't draw, and I haven't got no paints,"" answered Johnny. ""Do you cry?"" ""No! I'm too big for that,"" said the boy. ""I think I shall like you; so I'll bring it when I come"". ""I know I shall like you, because you are brave!"" cried the impetuous voice, with its pretty accent. An orange came tumbling through the hole, as if the new acquaintance longed to do something to help the ""ache"" ""Where do you live?"" Johnny ventured to ask; for there was a homesick sound to the voice as it said those last words. ""In Rome. Here we only stay a year, while papa arranges his affairs; then we go back, and I am happy."". ""I like better to be where it's always warm, and people are more beautiful than here. Are you beautiful?"" ""I guess not. Boys don't care for looks,"" replied Johnny. ""I am sorry for you, and I shall lend you a book to read when the pain comes."" ""I couldn't wait for that if I had a book,"" said Johnny, ""I wouldn't have to go to bed at all"" ""I don't mind the freckles on your nose and the whiteness of your face.. ""Let me see one of your books. They will be new to me. I'm tired of all mine"" Johnny laughed out from sheer delight at the thought of a new book. He seldom got one, being too poor to buy them, and too helpless to enjoy the free libraries of the city. ""Keep 'em all; they're not good for much, but they're the best I've got"" ""I have many more"" ""Keep it as long as you please. I do love so to read!"" ""I'm so good! I wish I had something for you"" ""Then you shall have it now"". ""They look very interesting. I shall go and read them now, and then come and talk again. Addio, Giovanni."" ""Good-by, Miss."" ""I'll do some prettier ones as soon as I can find more nice pictures and pieces"" ""I thank you. I'll come and see you again soon."" ""Yes, I will."" ""Thank you. Good-by."" ""By the way, Johnny, you're a very good boy."" ""You are?"" ""Yes. I am."" ""What?"" ""I'm a little boy. You're a little girl."" ""Oh, yes,. The Princess was a very good friend of Johnny Morris. The two of them lived together in a little house in the country. The Princess was very fond of Johnny, and would often come to visit him. Johnny would make her gay books, and she would listen to him whistle until he was hoarse, because she liked it. The pair lived together for about a year, until Johnny's father died, and the Princess moved away.. Fay was a true artist's child, and thought nothing so lovely as pictures. Johnny dreamed of the happy day when he should go and see the wonders his little friend described so well. His side of the wall was ravaged that hers might be adorned; and, as the last offering his grateful heart could give, he poked the toad through the hole, to live among the lilies and eat the flies that began to buzz about her Highness when she came to give her orders to her devoted subjects. ""I think it will be to-morrow,"" said Fay, ""for papa has a lazy fit coming on"". ""I don't care how I ache if I can only see the pictures--and you,"" he said. ""I wish papa was rich, then he would give you money,"" he added. ""So does mother, if we had money to go away in the country, and eat nice things; and have doctors."" ""So it's no use worrying,"" said Johnny. ""If he says you can come, I will have the flag up early and you can hurry."" ""Yes, I'll come,"" said the girl. ""And I'll bring my mother, too."". Fay clapped her hands decidedly. ""I'm going to learn to mend shoes. Mr. Pegget says he'll teach me. That doesn't need legs, and he gets enough to live on very well"" ""Nanna can teach you to braid straw as she did at home; that is easy and nice, and the baskets sell very well. ""Hurrah! I'm really going to-morrow. And you, too, mammy dear,"" cried the boy, waving his crutch so vigorously that he slipped and fell. ""Never mind; I'm used to it,"" said the boy. ""I will go at once and ask papa."" ""Yes!"" said Fay, and soon came back with a glad ""Yes"". ""Let me go and see him,"" begged Fay, imploringly. ""So dark, so damp, so poor, it is enough to break the heart,"" said Nanna, decidedly. ""If papa was here, he would let me go,"" said Fay. ""Pull me up, and I'll rest while we talk about it,"" he said cheerily, as his mother helped him to the bed, where he forgot his pain in. Fay concocted a fine plan, and, what was more remarkable, carried it out. For a week it rained, for a week Johnny lay in pain. Fay worked quietly at her little easel in the corner of the studio. Her father put the last touches to his fine picture. On Saturday the sun shone, Johnny was better, and the great picture was done. So were the small ones, for as her father sat resting after his work, Fay went to him, with a tired but happy face, and put several drawings into his hand. ""Papa, you said you would pay me a dollar for every good copy I made of the cast you gave me. I tried very. Fay's papa was bewildered by this queer jumble, because, being absorbed in his work, he had never heard half the child had told him, and had forgotten all about Johnny. ""You have tried, my good child, and here are your well-earned dollars. What do you want them for?"" ""To help my boy. I want him to come in here and see the pictures, and let Nanna teach him to plait baskets; and he can rest, and you will like him,"" said Fay. ""Bless your sweet soul, my darling, it would need more than I can spare. ""You say that about a great many things, papa. 'By and by' won't be long enough to do all you promise then. I like now much better, and poor Giovanni needs the country more than you need cigars or I new frocks,"" said Fay, stroking her father's tired forehead. ""My dear, I cannot give up my cigar, for in this soothing smoke I find inspiration, and though you are a little angel, you must be clothed; so wait a bit, and we will attend to the boy--later,"" he said.. ""This shall be the country for him till I get enough money to send him away. I will show what I can do. Now, now!"" cried Fay, losing patience. She dashed out of the room, down many stairs, through the kitchen, startling Nanna and scattering the salad.. Fay was full of love and pity for the poor boy pining for the fresh air and sunshine. ""I will beat down the wall, and he shall come in at once,"" panted Fay. Nanna, having collected her lettuce leaves and her wits, went to see what the child was about. She hurried up to tell ""the Signor,"" Fay's papa, that his little daughter was about to destroy the garden and bury herself under the ruins of the wall. ""The Signor"" said, ""Fay will not be harmed. She. The artist's child was stuck in a hole in a wall. The child was bathed in tears, her hands were bleeding, and dust covered her from head to foot. ""My darling, what afflicts you? Tell papa, and he will do anything you wish."" ""No, you will forget, you'll say 'Wait,' and now that I have seen it all, I cannot stop till I get him out of that dreadful place"" ""I cannot stop until I get you out of this dreadful place,"" he said. ""And I will not stop till you are out of it"". ""Well, well, it is a pitiful case; and easily mended, since Fay is so eager about it. Hope the lad is all she says, and nothing catching about his illness. Nanna can tell me."" Then he drew back his head, and leading Fay to the seat, took her on his knee, all flushed, dirty, and tearful as she was. ""Now let me hear all about it, and be sure I'll not forget. What shall I do to please you, dear, before you pull down the house about my ears?"""

""It's hardly worth while to rouse such a restless ghost as I, when I'm once fairly laid"" ""Yes, Laura,"" replied the girl, ""I know what you mean"" ""I'm just going to read it again,"" she adds, ""and again"". Laura, the cool blonde, disposed the folds of her white gown more gracefully about her, and touched up the eyebrow of the Minerva she was drawing. The old man went away into his imaginary paradise, and Nan into that domestic purgatory on a summer day, -- the kitchen. ""Let me have plenty of clean collars in my bag, for I must go. ""Nan was tired, having risen with the birds,--hurried, having many cares those happy little housewives never know,"" writes the author. ""She was too young to make the anxious lines upon her forehead seem at home there,"" she adds. ""Nan's hopes dwindled, peaked, and pined,"" says the author, ""and she was disappointed in a hope that hourly "" dwindled and peaked"" ""Nanny's"" story is about a young girl who learns to love her mother, and. Nan was one of that meek sisterhood who, thinking humbly of themselves, believe they are honored by being spent in the service of less conscientious souls. But some malignant sprite seemed to have taken possession of her kingdom, for rebellion broke out everywhere. She tore her gown, burnt her hand, and smudged the collar she was preparing to finish in the most unexceptionable style. She was a woman of the lowest order, but she had a heart of gold. She had a spirit of the highest order, and she had the heart of a lion.. ""Behold, she watereth her linen with salt tears, and be waileth herself because of much tribulation"" "". ""How good of you, to come through all this heat, and not to laugh at my despair!"" she said, looking up like a grateful child, as she led him in. ""I only obeyed orders, Nan; for a certain dear old lady had a motherly presentiment that you had got into a domestic whirlpool, and sent me as a sort of life-preserver"" ""I am a man of the world, and I am not afraid to say so,"" he replied.. John's advent, like that of Orpheus in hades, seemed to soothe all unpropitious powers with a sudden spell. The Fire began to slacken. the kettles began to lull, the meat began to cook, the irons began to cool, the clothes began to be have, the spirits began to rise. John watched the change, and, though a lord of creation,abased himself to take compassion on the weaker vessel. So I took the basket of consolation, and came to fold my feet upon the carpet of contentment in the tent. ""Oh, John, you needn't do that; I shall have time when I've turned the meat, made the pudding and done these things. See, I'm getting on finely now:--you're a judge of such matters; isn't that nice?"" ""As to the berry question, I might answer it with a gem from Dr. Dr. John Watts, relative to 'Satan' and idle hands,' but will merely say, that, as a matter of public safety, you'd better leave me alone. ""Such is the destructiveness of my nature, that I shall certainly eat something hurtful, break something valuable, or sit upon something crushable,"" he said. ""Where's Sally?"" asked John, looking vainly for the functionary who usually pervaded that region like a domestic police-woman, a terror to cats, dogs, and men. ""She has gone to her cousin's funeral, and won't be back till Monday. There seems to be a great fatality among her relations"". ""Where's Di?"" asked John, seized with a most unmasculine curiosity all at once. ""She is in Germany with 'Wilhelm Meister'; but, though 'lost to sight, to memory clear', for I was just thinking, as I did her things, how clever she is to like all kinds of books that I don't understand at all,"" said Nan. ""I think I could find it in my heart to murder an imaginary friend or two, if I had to stay here long,"" said John. ""Why, bless the dear man! I forgot it was time for the cider. Wouldn't you like to take it to him. ""I will; but please, John, go in to the girls and be comfortable; for I don't like to leave you here,"" said Nan. John extinguished her in his broad-brimmed hat, and offered the glass like a poisoned goblet. ""Mr.Robert of Lincoln' has something for your private ear,"" he said. ""It will do one's heart good to see you in it,"" he added, ""and the lane is so cool"". ""Nan, are you in hysterics?"" cried Di, appearing,book in hand. Nan laughed till the tears ran over her cheeks, and John was gratified at the efficacy of his treatment. Di looked ruffled, for the merry words were a covert reproach. She tossed ""Wilhelm""out of the window, exclaiming, irefully, ""It's all Goethe's fault"" ""I'm never where I ought to be, and never think of anything till it's too. ""Good-bye, my dears! I shall be back early on Monday morning; so take care of yourselves,and be sure you all go and hear Mr. Emerboy preach to-morrow. My regards to your mother. Come, Solon!"" But Solon merely cocked one ear, and remained a fixed fact. He knew things were not right; therefore he did not go ahead. ""Oh, by the way, girls, don't forget to payTommy Mullein for bringing up the cow: he expects it to. ""Bless me! I've forgotten my spectacles. Very awkward to find myself without them ten miles away. Thank you, John. Don't neglect to water the lettuce,Nan, and don't overwork yourself, my little 'Martha.' Come--"" At this juncture Solon suddenly went off,. Laura retired to take her siesta; Nan made a small carbon arrow of herself by sharpening her sister's crayons. Di, as a sort of penance for past sins, tried her patience over a piece of knitting, in which she soon originated a somewhat remarkable pattern, by dropping every third stitch, and seaming ad libitum. If John bad been a gentlemanly creature, with refined tastes, he would have elevated his feet and made a nuisance of himself by indulging in a ""weed;""but being only an uncultivated youth, with a rustic regard for pure air and womankind in general, he kept his head. ""No, I'm very sorry; for I like to see you coming and going as you used to, years ago, and I miss you very much when you are gone, John,""answered truthful Nan. ""How glad you must feel to hear it!"" he said, looking up from a thoughtful examination of the hard-working little citizens of the Industrial Community settled in Nan's work-basket. ""I'm very glad to hear that,"" replied truthful Nan, whittling away.. Nan laughed merrily, as she looked at the burns on her hand. Di elevated the most prominent feature of her brown countenance, and sighed despondingly. ""Dear, dear, what a disappointing world this is,"" she said. ""I no sooner build a nice castle in Spain, and settle a smart young knight therein, than down it comes about my ears"" ""If I were only a man, I would do something better than that, and prove that heroes are not all dead yet,"" she added. ""If only I were a man,"" said Di.. ""I am a woman, and must sit rasping my temper with absurdities like this,"" she said. ""I am not a man, but a woman. And I am a daughter of the world."" ""I'm a woman,"" he replied. ""And I am not ashamed of that."" ""But I am ashamed of the way I am acting,"" she added. ""Because I'm a girl, and I'm supposed to be a woman."" ""And so I am,"" he said, ""and I am. And so I will be."" ""Yes,"" she replied, ""but I'm not ashamed."" ""No, not at all,"" he agreed. ""You are not."". ""God bless you for it, John!"" cried a fervent voice. ""I told him the change in Laura's health and spirits was silently working in his favor"" John rose involuntarily in the presence of an innocent nature whose sorrow needed no interpreter to him. He went away at last as patient as Jacob ready to serve another 'seven years' for his beloved Rachel. ""The cold, listless Laura transformed into a tender girl, all aglow with love and longing, as she dropped her mask, and showed a living countenance eloquent.

""And I'll come back and see you later."" ""I'll be back,"" she replied. ""Yes, I will,"" he replied, ""but I'll be a little later."". Nan's shoe was the first to be taken off, and the last to be put back on. She had been wearing it as a sign of respect for her father, who had died in a car crash. She is now wearing it again, and it is a sign that she will be able to walk again. She has been in a wheelchair since she was a child, and has been unable to walk for years. She will soon be able, she says, to walk with the help of a cane.. The wood was full of creatures, and there was none to make afraid. Warm airs were all afloat, full of vernalodors for the grateful sense. Silvery birches shimmered like spirits of the wood, larches gave their green tassels to the wind. Pines made airy music sweet and solemn, as they stood looking heavenward through veils of summer sunshine or shrouds of wintry snow. An unseen influence filled the air with new delights, and touched earth and sky with a beauty never seen before. The wood was a. The Mayflower is a novel about the life of a young woman. The story is about the relationship between a young girl and her mother. The novel is written by the daughter of a teacher and a teacher's daughter. It is set in the early 1900s in London. The author is a former teacher and mother-of-three. The book is about a girl who fell in love with her mother's mother.. Di, being tired of running, riding, climbing, and boating, decided at last to let her body rest and put her equally active mind through what classical collegians term ""a course of sprouts"" Noiseless and cheerful as the sunshine, she went to and fro, doing the tasks that mothers do, but without a mother's sweet reward. She held fast the numberless slight threads that bind a household tenderly together, and making each day a beautiful success. Di became prophetic with Mahomet,belligerent with Cromwell, and made the French Revolution a veritable Reign of Terror to her family. Goethe and Schiller alternated like fever and ague; Mephist.

0.29,0.39,24.98754773368753,"Sixty years ago, up among the New Hampshire hills, lived Farmer Bassett, with a house full of sturdy sons and daughters growing up about him. They were poor in money, but rich in land and love, for the wide acres of wood, corn. Savory smells were in the air; on the crane hung steaming kettles, and down among the red embers copper sauce-pans simmered. Two small boys sat on the wooden settle shelling corn for popping, and picking out the biggest nuts from the goodly store their own hands had. ""I do like to begin seasonable and have things to my mind,"" says Bassett. ""It does take a sight of victuals to fill all these hungry stomicks,"" says the good woman.. ""Sakes alive, I don't, boys! It's a marcy it don't come but once a year. I always have room enough, and I'd like to have Thanksgiving every day,"" said Solomon.. ""I like to see all the cousins and aunts, and have games, and sing,"" said Tilly. ""I don't care a mite for all that,"" said quiet Prue. ""Here's a man comin' up the hill, I guess it's Gad Hopkins"". The Bassett family's apple tree is in full bloom. A stranger comes to deliver the fruit to the Bassett's. The fruit is not what the family had hoped for. The Bassetts' fruit tree is still in full flower.. ""I'm dreadful sorry, dears, but it can't be helped. I couldn't cook nor eat no way, now,"" said Mrs Bassett. The children left their work to help her get ready, mingling their grief for ""Gran'ma"" with regrets for. Not a child complained after that, but ran about helpfully, bringing moccasins, heating the footstone, and getting ready for a long drive. By the time the old yellow sleigh was at the door, the bread was in. ""Tilly, put extry comfortables on the beds to-night, the wind is so searchin' up chamber. Have the baked beans and Injun-puddin' for dinner, and whatever you do. Tilly Bassett was packed into the sleigh and driven away, leaving a stream of directions behind her. Eph, the sixteen-year-old boy, immediately put on his biggest boots, and surveyed his little responsibilities with a paternal air, drolly like his father's.. Tilly got them a good dinner, and when it was over the two elder girls went to their spinning. In the kitchen stood the big and little wheels, and baskets of wool-rolls, ready to be twisted into yarn. Tilly and Prue sang, as they stepped to and fro, drawing out the smoothly twisted threads to the musical hum of the great spinning-wheels. The little girls chattered like magpies over their dolls and the new bed-spread they were planning to make, all white dimity stars. The family of the Bassett family lived in a small house in the middle of a field. Eph loved reading, and Sol and Seth never failed to play a few games of Morris with barley corns. Tilly and Eph would read to each other and play games, while the sisters knit.. ""Tell it,"" commanded Roxy, from the cradle, where she was drowsily cuddled with Rhody. ""Well, a long time ago, when Charles the First was in prison, Lord Bassett was a true friend to him,"" began Eph. ""The lord had some papers that would have hung a lot of people if. ""But she didn't cry; she just called her brother, and sat down in that chair, with her head leaning back on those papers, like a queen, and waited while the soldiers hunted the house over for 'em,"" said Tilly.. Seth planted himself before Tilly, with the long poker in his hand, saying, as he flourished it valiantly: ""Why didn't the boy take his father's sword and lay about him? I would, if any one was ha'sh to Tilly."" Tilly replied: ""You bantam! He was only a. ""She was 'a pious maid,' the book says, and often spent the long evenings reading the Bible, with her brother by her, with no one to help her bear her secret, and no good news of her father. The servants thought the fright had hurt her wits, and let her be,. Matilda knew the ring, but would not tell until she had asked many questions, so as to be very sure. While the man answered all about her father and the king, she looked at him sharply. ""Our Tilly would have been as brave, I know, and she looks like the old picter down to Grandma's, don't she. Tilly tucked up the children under the ""extry comfortables,"" and having kissed them all around, as Mother did, crept into her own nest. Till would fight like a wild cat, but she. ""Now about dinner,"" said the young housekeeper. ""I can make a pudding as well as anybody, I guess"" ""I don't know how,"" replied the little girl. ""We don't have a real Thanksgiving dinner"" ""We'll have to wait and see,"" said her mother.. ""If we can't boil vegetables, we don't deserve any dinner,"" said Tilly. ""Pa is coming to-night, so we won't have dinner till late,"" added Tilly, suddenly realizing the novelty of the task she had undertaken. ""Did you ever roast a. ""I wish you'd put a fire in the best room, so the little ones can. ""Don't we always do it Sundays and Thanksgivings? Wouldn't Ma wish the children kept safe and warm anyhow? Can I get up a nice dinner with four rascals under my feet all the time?"". Eph lingered over his chores in the barn as long as possible, and left the girls in peace. ""Now, sister, we'll have dinner at five; Pa will be here by that time if he is coming to-night, and be so surprised to find us all ready,"" said Tilly. ""I shall give the children a piece at noon, with apple-pie and cider will please 'em,"" said. ""It's all ready but the stuffing, and roasting is as easy as can be. I can baste first rate. There's beans for Eph; he likes cold pork, so we won't stop to warm it up, for there's lots to do, and. Prue laughed as Tilly attacked the plum-pudding. She felt pretty sure of coming out right, here, for she had seen her mother do it so many times, it looked very easy. So in went suet and fruit; all sorts of spice, and brandy instead of wine. ""Ma puts in some kind of mint, I know, but I forget whether it is spearmint, peppermint, or penny-royal,"" said Prue. ""Sage and onions and apple-sauce go with goose,"" said Tilly. ""I can't feel sure of anything but pepper and salt. Prue was so full of the smell of the onions she had been peeling, that everything smelt of them. The best is up garret; you run and get some, while I mash the bread,"" commanded Tilly. ""Shall we roast the little pig, too? I think he'd look nice. ""I loved that little pig, and cried when he was killed,"" said Tilly. ""I should feel as if I was roasting the baby,"" said Eph.. The Bassetts were going to try the ice down by the old mill. Tilly was bent on having her dinner look well, no matter what its other failings. The boys assured her they would be starving by five o'clock.. The table was not at all the sort of table we see now, but would look very plain and countrified to us. The cloth was coarse, but white as snow, and the little maids had seen the blue-eyed flax grow. They had no napkins and little silver; but the best tankard and Ma. The children were playing in the yard when they heard a bear growl. They ran to the window and saw four small black figures tearing up the road. They screamed: ""The bear, the bear! Eph, get the gun! He's coming, he's coming!"" Eph dropped his. ""Oh, Eph, don't let him eat us,"" cried both little girls, flying up stairs to hide under their mother's bed. ""No danger of that, you little geese. I'll shoot him as soon as he. ""Get the ax, Tilly, and if I should miss, stand ready to keep him off while I load again,"" said Eph, anxious to kill his first bear. Tilly flew for the ax and was at her brother's side by the time the bear was near. ""You'd have had a warm welcome if we hadn't found you out. I'd have put a bullet through you in a jiffy, old chap,"" said Eph. ""I jest meant to give 'em a little scare, but they run like partridges, and I ke. ""I should have known you in a minute if I hadn't been asleep when the girls squalled,"" he said. ""Well, I can't help it. The turkey is burnt, and the pies I put to warm are all ashes"". ""I couldn't think of victuals when I expected to be eaten alive myself, could I?"" pleaded poor Prue, who had tumbled into the cradle when the rain of oranges began."
0.78,0.88,52.85368384641992,"Toady was a tyrant at home, a rebel at school, a sworn foe to law, order, and Aunt Kipp. As cool, saucy, hard-handed, and soft-hearted a little specimen of young America was Toady as you would care to see. ""Children and fools speak the truth."" ""I'm tired, mother, tired of working and waiting. If I'm ever going to have any fun, I want it now while I can enjoy it."" ""You shouldn't wait another hour if I could have my way; but you know how helpless I am"" ""I don't want to go to school, I just want to have some fun."". Toady Lamb was a reprobate by all but his mother, sister, and sister's sweetheart, Van Bahr Lamb. He was taught that lying was a deadly sin, and bolted out the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. His abrupt abruptness that brought wrath and dismay upon his friends and relatives. He told his sister, ""I don't want her old money, and I'll tell her so if she bothers me about it"" He was a liar, a liar and a liar. He lied to his sister. He lie to his family. He lies to his friends. He lying to his mother.. ""Mother, did aunt say anything about coming this week?"" asked Polly, after a pause of intense thought over a breadth with three darns, two spots, and a burn. ""Yes; she wrote that she was too feeble to come at present, as she had such dreadful palpitations she didn't dare stir from her room. So we are quite safe for the next week at least, and--bless my soul, there she is now!"" Mrs Snow clasped her hands with a gesture of dismay, and sat as if transfixed by a ponderous lady, in an awe-inspiring bonnet, who came walking slowly down the street. ""Nothing but salt fish for dinner,"" wailed Mrs Snow.. ""Van will make a fool of himself, and ruin everything,"" sighed Polly, glancing at the ring on her finger. ""I know she'll kiss me; she never will let a fellow alone,"" growled Toady, scowling darkly. ""My dear aunt, I'm very glad to see you,"" murmured Mrs. Snow, as the shadow of the coming event fell upon her. ""S. ""What a fib that was!"" said Toady, sotto voce. ""I changed my mind. Theodore, come and kiss me,"" answered Aunt Kipp. ""Yes'm,"" was the plaintive reply. ""Go and wash this moment, sir,"" said Mary. ""It's paint, and dirt, and glue, and it won't come off"" ""Yes,"" said Theodore, ""I'll wash it off."" ""Yes, sir. You will,"" replied Mary. 'Yes, I will,"" he said. 'I'll clean it off.'. ""I'm glad you are better,"" said Mary, reverently receiving the funereal head-gear. ""I'm not better,"" cut in Aunt Kipp. ""My days are numbered; I stand on the brink of the tomb, and may drop at any moment"" ""Why don't you, then?"" was on his lips, but a frown from Polly restrained him. ""Have a cup of tea, aunt?"" said Mrs. Kipp, ""and I'll make you a cup"" ""No, thank Heaven, I've got no boys,"" cried Aunt Kipper. ""Why not?"" said Polly. ""Because I'm so fat."". ""I say, what's a bore?"" asked Toady from the rug, where he sat rocking meditatively to and fro, holding on by his shoe-strings. ""It's a kind of a pig, very fierce, and folks are afraid of 'em,"" said Aunt Kipp, whose knowledge of Natural History was limited. ""Lie down and rest a little,"" suggested Polly. ""I will,"" said Toady. ""Take my things away, and have dinner early."". ""Mary is a nice, grateful, respectful, loving niece, and I shan't forget her, she may depend on that,"" and Aunt Kipp laughed grimly. ""You are fat, you know, and fierce sometimes, and folks are afraid of you. Good, wasn't it?"" ""Yes'm. Van settled it last week, and Polly's been so happy ever since,"" said Toady. ""I'll tell you a secret, if you won't let Polly know I spoke first,"" said Aunt Kipper. ""Van and she were sweethearts in a minute,"" said Van.. Toady's dirty little face was expressive of brotherly good-will, persuasive frankness, and a placid consciousness of having ""fixed it"" ""I don't like it, and I'll put a stop to it. I won't have any ridiculous baa-baas in my family,"" said Toady. ""We all like it,"" said Aunt Kipp. ""If we were not afraid of you"" ""We don't want a fuss,"" said the boy. ""You won't make one, will you, now?"". ""If Mary counts on my money to begin housekeeping with, she'll find herself mistaken,"" says Toady. ""Not one penny shall she have, married or single, and you may tell her so"" ""Toady was so taken aback by this explosion that he let go his shoe-strings, fell over with a crash, and lay flat"" ""The meekness of that boy at dinner-time was so angelic that Mrs. Snow would have feared speedy translation for him, if she had not been very angry"". Toady's mother took him into the china-closet. Polly's red eyes, and Aunt Kipp's griffinesque expression of countenance, weighed upon his soul so heavily, that even roly-poly pudding failed to assuage his trouble. ""I didn't mean to do it, I truly didn't! I thought I'd just 'give her a hint,' as you say. She looked all right, and laughed when I told her about being a bore, and I thought she liked it."" If she was a man, I'd thrash her for making Polly cry,"" said Toady.. ""I'll try, mother; but I'm always getting into scrapes with Aunt Kipp. She's worse than measles, any day,--such an old aggrawater!"" ""You can't do that: so just be careful and not make any more mischief, dear."" ""I'm afraid our last chance is gone, deary, and we must rub along as we have done"" ""Oh, dear, no! He will probably make things ten times. ""Keep it forever 'n' ever; I'm awful sorry!"" he said. Thrusting his beloved jackknife, with three blades and a file, into Polly's hand. Then, feeling that the magnitude of this sacrifice atoned for everything, he went to watch for Van,--the forlorn hope to which he now clung. ""Sophy, I'm surprised at your want of judgment. Do you really mean to let your girl marry this Lamb? Why, the man's a fool!"" began Aunt Kipp, after dinner.. Polly, knowing that contradiction would delight Aunt Kipp, coolly remarked, ""I like fools"" Aunt Kipper: ""Bless my heart! what does the girl mean?"" Polly: ""If Van is a fool, I prefer simpletons to wiseacres"" ""I know he is shy and awkward, and does absurd things now and then,"" said Polly. ""But I also know that he has the kindest heart that ever was,"" she added. ""He will wait for me a dozen years, if I say so. Polly's mother and Aunt Kipp were furious with her. Polly's father was also upset. Polly was to marry Toady. She was to leave for London in the next day or two. She had to see Judge Banks about altering her will. She did not want to leave Toady in the care of her mother. She wanted to marry him. She loved him. He was a help and comfort to mother, a good friend.. ""Get the big carryall and old Bob, so the boy can drive, and all of you come,"" said Aunt Kipp. ""That dear boy"" distorted his young countenance frightfully behind her back, but found a balm for every wound in the delight of being commander of the expedition. The big carry-all appeared, and, with much creaking and swaying Mrs. Kipp was got into the back seat, where the big bonnet gloomed like a thunder-cloud. The ""dear boy"" was a good driver, and the trip did the family good.. Polly was in a high state of indignation, which only made her look ten times prettier. Toady was a sight to see as he drove off with his short legs planted against the boot, his elbows squared, and the big whip cracking now and then. Aunt Kipp entertained the girl with a glowing account of the splendors of her own wedding, and aggravated the boy by frequent pokes and directions in the art of driving, of which she was of course, profoundly ignorant. ""Don't go over any bridges or railroad crossings or by any saw-mills,"" said the old lady. ""Yes'm,"" returned Toady, with a crack which would have done honor to a French postilion.. Polly laughed, and Toady chuckled, as they caught glimpses of the awful bonnet vibrating wildly in the background. But both grew sober as a shrill car-whistle sounded not far off. Bob, as if possessed by an evil spirit, turned suddenly into the road that led to the railroad crossing. He broke into a run, and rattled the old lady over the stones with a velocity which left her speechless. He scarcely seemed to feel it, for he had been a racer once, and when his blood was up he was hard to handle. He was beginning to look scared, and began to tug with all his might, and said, ""I can't, Polly,--I. The instant they were safe, Polly, like a regular heroine, threw herself into the arms of her dishevelled preserver, who of course was Van. The boy sat as stiff and rigid as a wooden figure till they took the reins from him. Then all the strength seemed to go out of him, and he leaned against his sister, as white and trembling as she, whispering with an irrepressible sob, ""O Polly, wasn't it horrid? Tell mother I stood by you like a man"" The story was told in a book called ""The Adventures of Van Vlaar"" which was published in the U.S. in 1872.. Mrs. Kipp was extricated and restored to consciousness. She kept the town in a ferment till three doctors had pronounced her perfectly well able to go home. She did not expire, but, having safely arrived, went to bed in high dudgeon, and led Polly and her mother a sad life of it for two days. She was later found to have died of a heart attack, but her condition was described as ""unharmed and unharmed"" by her family. She died on the way home, and was buried by her daughter.. Aunt Kipp's rubicund visage, surrounded by the stiff frills of an immense nightcap, caused the irreverent boy to explode with laughter in his handkerchief. ""Ah! poor dear, his feelings are too much for him. He sees my doom in my face, and is overcome by what you refuse to believe,"" she said. ""I shan't forget that boy's devotion. Now leave me to the meditations befitting these solemn hours."" Mrs. Snow retired, and Aunt Kipp tried to sleep; but the murmur of voices, and the sound of stifled laughter in the next room disturbed her repose.. T. Snow, Jr. had a blond curly head, a long face, pale, mild eyes, a plaintive voice, and a general expression of innocent timidity strongly suggestive of animated mutton. But Baa-baa was a ""trump,"" as Toady emphatically declared, and though every one laughed at him, every one liked him, and that is more than can be said of many saints and sages. He adored Polly, was dutifully kind to her mother, and had stood by T. Snow,. Jr., in many an hour of tribulation with fraternal fidelity.. ""I'm tired of being a slave to a cruel old woman just because she's rich,"" says Toady. ""I declare I'd wash my hands of her entirely, and do the best I could for myself,"" says Polly. ""Hooray for Polly! I always said let her money go and be jolly without it,"" cried Toady, who, in his character of wounded hero, reposed with a lordly air on the sofa. ""It's on your account, children, that I bear with aunt's temper as I do,"" says Mrs Toad. ""She owes it to your dear father, who was devoted to her while he lived, to provide for his children when he couldn't;"" says Mrs. Toad.. ""Don't you worry about me, mother; I'll take care of myself and you too,"" remarked Toady, with the cheery belief in impossibilities which makes youth so charming. Snow dropped a tear, and stitched away on a small trouser-leg which was suffering from a complicated compound fracture. ""Now, Van, tell us what to do, for things have come to such a pass that we must either break away altogether or be. ""Have you tried to soften your aunt's heart?"" he asked, after a moment's meditation. ""Good gracious, Van, she hasn't got any,"" cried Polly, who firmly believed it. ""Well, Polly, if the old lady has no heart you'd better let her go, for people without hearts are not worth much"". ""I don't mind, I'm used to it,"" says the young woman. ""I just wish she could hear you make it,"" he adds, referring to his wife. ""She's a good girl,"" she replies, ""and I'm glad to see you."" ""I'm glad you're happy,"" he says, ""but I don't want you to be,"" she adds. ""You're not going to get rich, are you?"" ""No,"" he replies. ""Not at all."" ""You'll get rich,"" she says. ""If you want to, you'll get richer."" ""Yes, I will,"" he responds. ""But I'm not going anywhere."" ""No, you won't,"" she responds.. ""Let's do it!"" cried Toady, fired with the thought of privy conspiracy and rebellion. ""Mother would be so comfortable with Polly, and I'd help Van in the store, when I've learned that confounded multiplication table,"" he added with a groan. ""If Aunt Kipp comes a visiting, we'll just say 'Not at home,' and let her trot off again,"" said Van. ""It sounds very nice, but aunt will be dreadfully offended and I don't wish to be ungrateful,"" said Mrs. Snow, brightening visibly. ""There's no ingratitude about it,"" cried Van.. ""No one cares for her, because she cares for nobody,"" said Mrs. Snow. ""Not a single heart will ache when she dies,"" said her daughter. ""She might have done everything to make you love, and respect, and admire her, and been a happy, useful, motherly, old soul,"" said the narrator. ""But she didn't choose to, and now she must take the consequences"". Toady proposed a change of costume. The old lady stole back to bed, wide awake, and with subjects enough to meditate upon now. The shaking up had certainly done her good, for somehow the few virtues she possessed came to the surface, and the mental shower-bath just received had produced a salutary change. The boy said soberly, ""You'd better put tails on my jackets, mother; then the next time we get run away with, Aunt Kipp will have something to hold on by"". Polly wouldn't have doubted her aunt's possession of a heart, if she could have known the pain and loneliness that made it ache. Aunt Kipp laid it on the pillow, muttering, drearily, ""I might have been a happy, useful woman, but I didn't choose to, and now it's too late"" It was too late to be all she may have been,. ""They say I've got no heart; I'll show 'em that I have,"" she said to herself. ""They don't want my money, I'll make 'em take it: they turn their backs on me."" ""I'll just render myself so useful and agreeable that they can't do without me"" ""I will earn a little love before the end came,"" she vowed. ""I can do anything for you"". Toady suspected that this elegant article of dress was intended for him, and yearned to possess it. Aunt Kipp had one soft place in her heart, though it was partially ossified, as she very truly declared, and Toady was enshrined therein. She thought there never was such a child, and loved him as she had done his father before him. She scolded, snubbed, and predicted he'd come to a bad end in public; but she forgave his naughtiest pranks, always brought him something when she came, and privately intended to make his future comfortable with half her fortune. There was a dash and daring, a generosity and integrity, about the little fellow, that char. Aunt Kipp was fond of the boy,--a deal fonder than he deserved,--for he was as mischievous a monkey as any that ever lived in a tree, with a curly tail. Sophy was weak and low-spirited, Polly pretty and headstrong, and Aunt Kipp didn't think much of either of them; but Toady defied, distracted, and delighted her, and to Toady she clung. She was rich, and hadn't made up her mind who she'd leave her money to.. ""If you are tired I won't go on,"" said Aunt Kipp. ""I'm not tired, 'm,"" replied Toady, with a gravity that nearly upset the old lady. ""It's a very interesting story,"" said the old woman. ""And in spite of all this, that kind, good, forgiving grandma left that bad boy twenty thousand dollars when she died"". ""I--I think she was a regular dear,"" cried Toady, holding on to the chair with both hands, as if that climax rather took him off his legs. ""And what did the boy do about it?"" continued Aunt Kipp, curiously. ""He bought a velocipede, and gave his sister half, and paid his mother's rent, and put a splendid marble cherakin over the old lady, and had a jolly good time, and--"" ""I'll give you the biggest one I can find when you die. But I'm not in a very great hurry to have you,"" said. ""I think she was a selfish pig,--don't you?"" asked Aunt Kipp. ""No, I don't, sir; and I'm sure that little boy wasn't such a fool as to lose the money,"" said Toady. ""He minded his grandma's wishes, and kept it all,"" said Aunt Kipper. ""But, Toady, the boy did wrong in giving his sister half; she didn't deserve any,"" said Polly.

Yet only physically; my spirit was rebellious still.’ ““I felt perfectly powerless.

""I think it pleased him, for swiftly as it had come the dark look passed, and quietly, as if we were the best of friends, he began to relate certain exciting adventures he had known abroad,"" says the author. ""I was leaning confidentially on his shoulder, asking for more, yet conscious of an instinctive distrust of this man whom I had so soon learned to fear yet fancy,"" he adds. ""He selected two cigarettes, mildly aromatic with the herbs they were composed of, lit them, offered me one, dropped the window, and leaning back surveyed me with an air of extreme enjoyment,"" he says. ""As I sat meekly puffing and wondering what prank I should play a part. The narcotic influence of the herbs diffused itself like a pleasant haze over all my senses. sleep, the most grateful, fell upon my eyelids, and the last thing I remember was my uncle’s face dreamily regarding me through a cloud of fragrant smoke. Twilight wrapped us in its shadows when I woke, with the night wind blowing on my forehead, the muffled roll of wheels sounding in my ear, and my. “Home at last, thank Heaven!” my uncle led me over a terrace into a long hall, light and warm, and odorous with the breath of flowers blossoming here and there in graceful groups. A civil, middle-aged maid received and took me to my room, a bijou of a place, which increased my wonder when told that my uncle had chosen all its decorations and superintended their arrangement. “He understands women,” I thought, handling the toilet ornaments, trying luxurious chair and lounge, and ending by slipping my feet into the scarlet and white Turkish slippers, coquettishly turning up their toes.. ""I was doubtless to meet my future husband at that meal, and in a moment every faculty was intent upon achieving a grand toilette for this first interview,"" she said. ""The master’s never allowed dinner to wait for any one,"" she added.. “So am I, Sybil.” I had unconsciously spoken aloud, and the echo came from the doorway where stood my uncle, carefully dressed, looking comelier and cooler than ever. “I’m glad I’re pretty!” “Yes,” replied Sybil, “and so am I.’’ ‘I am so glad you are pretty. I am so happy to be pretty’.. ‘You were so absorbed in the contemplation of your charming self, that Janet answered my tap and took herself away unheard. You are mistress of my table now: it waits; will you come down?’ ‘I tried to devour my chagrin with my dinner, and exerted myself to charm my uncle into the belief that I had forgotten my cousin. It was a failure, however, for that empty seat had an irresistible fascination for me.’‘More than once, as my eye returned from its furtive scrutiny of napkin, plate, and trio of colored glasses, it met my uncle’s and fell before his penetrative glance’.. “You have seen one trait of his character to-night; does it please you?” “Yes; for I’d rather see the hawk free than coming tamely at your call, uncle,” I answered saucily. He frowned slightly, as if unused to such liberty of speech, yet bowed when I swept him a stately little curtsey and sailed away to the drawing-room.. The author was in a suite of handsome rooms in a Parisian hotel. She was enjoying a moment of solitary grandeur when the door was flung wide and a blithe voice broke out into a hunting song. The voice was so like her uncle's that she involuntarily flew to the door and cried: ""Guy is come!” The author's uncle was a huntsman, and the song was so similar to his uncle's she thought it was his. The story was published in a book called ""The Adventures of Guy"" (1881-1883) by Charles Dickens, published by Chatto & Windus, £16.99.. ""How will he meet me? and how shall I meet him?” I thought, looking up at the bright-faced boy, whose portrait looked back at me with a mirthful light in the painted eyes. Presently the quick steps came flying down again, past the door, straight to the dining-room opposite. I heard an imperious young voice say rapidly. “Impertinent boy!” I muttered, yet at the same moment resolved to deserve his appellation. I possessed a pretty foot, therefore one little slipper appeared quite naturally below the last flounce of my dress. A bracelet glittered on my arm as it emerged from among the lace and carnation knots; that arm supported my head. My profile was well cut, my eyelashes long, therefore I read with face half averted from the door. “I’m glad to be rid of it; so I’ll drink your health, father,. ""I knew they paused on the threshold, but never stirred till an irrepressible, “You are right, sir!” escaped the younger. Then I rose prepared to give him the coldest greeting, yet I did not. I saw, instead, a man comely and tall. A dark moustache half hid the proud mouth; the vivacious eyes were far kinder, though quite as keen as his father’s"". Guy’s glance of pleased surprise was flatteringly frank, his smile so cordial, his “Welcome, cousin!” such a hearty sound, that my coldness melted in a breath. Before I could restrain myself I had offered both hands with the impulsive exclamation. “Cousin Guy, I know I shall be very happy here! Are you glad I have come?” “Glad as I am to see the sun after a November fog,” he replied.. Guy stood on the rug, surveying me with an expression of surprise that rather nettled my pride. I wonder if he knows I am to be his wife, and likes it. Guy laughed a boyish laugh as he sat down on his father’s footstool, saying, while he warmed his slender brown hands, “I haven’t seen a lady for a month, so I stare like a boor at sight of a silk gown and high-bred face.”. “Shall we have a flock of people here to make it gay for you, cousin, or do you prefer our quiet style better?” “If Sybil likes, ask her’ ““If. “Ah, don’t I!” he said. “I like freedom; so do you, I think.” ‘I’m not gay.’ ‘You’re not gay,’ he replied. ‘So do I. I’ve never been gay. I don�’says Guy.‘I don”t care for society, and strangers wouldn�”’’Guy’. ’‘Ah, I like freedom. I. like freedom’, says Guy. ”So do you.“ ‘. Before the evening ended Guy was kneeling on the rug beside me, our two heads close together, while he turned the contents of the great portfolio spread before us. I watched him covertly, and soon owned to myself that he was all I most admired in the ideal hero every girl creates in her romantic fancy. For I no longer looked upon this young man as my cousin, but my lover, and through all our future intercourse this thought was always uppermost, full of a charm that never lost its power. “Is that your horse Sultan?” I called from my window next morning, as I looked down upon my cousin, who was coming up the drive from an early gallop on the moors. “Yes, bonny Sybil; come and admire him,” he called back, hat in hand, and a quick smile rippling over his face.“If your saddle had come, we would take a turn before ‘my lord’. Lochinvar was a Scottish playwright. He is best known for his play ""The Lark Ascending"" He also wrote the novel ""The Little Prince"" about his father, Lochinvar. He died in a car crash in 1975. He was buried in LochinVar, near the town of Lough Linn, in Scotland. The play was set in the same place.. Guy dismounted, and, standing with his arm about the saddle to steady me in my precarious seat, began to talk. “Do you like your new home, cousin?” “More than I can tell you!”“And my father, Sybil?’ “Both yes and no to that question, Guy; I hardly know him yet.”. “Is any of my property in this part of the country, Guy? Do you know I am as ignorant as a baby about my own affairs?” “I left the rest to madame and uncle, though the first hadn’t a bit of judgment, and the last I scarcely knew.”“I sat on his knee yesterday and smoked a cigarette of his own offering, though madame would have fainted if she had seen me; then I slept on his arm an hour, and he was fatherly kind, though I teased him like a gn. “All you see is yours, Sybil,” was the brief answer. “But where, then, is your home, Guy?” “Nowhere,’ he replied. ‘My father has prepared things for you, and is to share your home until you marry.’ “When will that be, I wonder?’ I stole a glance from under my lashes, wild to discover if Guy knew of the compact and was a willing party to it. � “I never cared to ask questions before, but now I am intensely. ""I might be very happy if I learned to love him, as I should, if he were always in that kindest mood of his,"" I said. ""He is not your own uncle, you know.” ""I smiled at the idea, but Guy did not see it,"" I replied. ""Well, why not?"" ""I hope he will be tempted to remain a fixture with you on his knee as ‘madame my wife. “Dear Guy, forgive me if I pained you. I’m a thoughtless creature, but I'm not malicious, and a word will restrain me if kindly spoken. Would you like me for a little mamma, Guy?” “No!” short and sharp as a pistol shot. “Then you must marry and have a home of your own, my son.”“I’d rather you didn’t see me in a rage,” he said. � “I am not. ""I think I should not be to you, for you understand me, Sybil, and with you I hope to grow a better man. My home is always yours, and when my fortune is mine you shall never want, if you are not too proud to accept help from your own kin. You are a little proud, aren’t you?” He checked his words suddenly, like one who has gone too far. He bent his own upon the ground, as if to hide the unwonted feeling that had mastered him. It lasted but a moment, then his old manner returned, as he said gayly, “There drops your slipper. They say it is a foot like this that. “Poets say it is sweet to give up liberty for love, and they ought to know,” said Guy, with a sidelong glance. “I never had one, for madame guarded me like a dragon, and I led the life of a nun.” “When I do find one I shall try his mettle well before I give up my liberty,’ said Sybil, “and I am not cruel to your lovers.’”“I am not Cruel to Your Lovers, Sybil?” asked Guy. ‘‘I am cruel to all. The day so began passed pleasantly, spent in roving over house and grounds with my cousin, setting my possessions in order, and writing to dear old madame. Twilight found me in my bravest attire, with Guy’s heather in my hair, listening for his step, and longing to run and meet him when he came. He had gathered me a knot of purple heather, and as he gave it I smiled my sweetest on him, saying: “I commission you to supply me with nosegays, for you have taste, and I love wild-flowers.” He replied: ‘I shall wear this at dinner in honor of its giver. Now take me home; for. ""The world seemed all in tune now, and when I went to the drawing-room I was moved to play my most stirring marches, sing my blithest songs, hoping to bring one at least of the gentlemen to join me"" ""My uncle looked harassed and yet amused, Guy looked sullen and eyed his father with covert glances. It looked a little like it, for he threw himself upon a couch and lay there silent and morose"" ""Is Guy jealous so soon?’ I asked myself, ""Is he jealous?"" ""Yes, he is. He is jealous of his father, and I am. I wanted to try my power over them both, to see if I could restore that gentler mood of my uncle’s, and assure myself that Guy cared whether I was friendliest with him or not. I asked, stealing a sly glance at my uncle. “Do you know that pretty chanson about ‘Love and Wine, and the Seine to-morrow,’ cousin Guy?” I asked. ‘No one; uncle sang a bit of it in the carriage yesterday. I like the air, so come and teach me the rest.’. “I thought she was asleep, and unconsciously began it to beguile a silent drive. Sing on, Sybil; that Bacchanalian snatch will do you no harm.” “I intend to go there as soon as I’m of age, if you will let me’ “ “You choose strange entertainment for a lady, sir.’“ ‘I’ve. “I begin to feel quite homelike and happy here with you, and shall be content without other society.” “Only till you marry. Does your guardianship extend beyond that time?’ “No fear of that, Sybil; I shall hold you fast till some younger guardian comes to rob me of my merry ward.’”“Only until you marry,” he replied.. ""Was that Guy’s mother, sir?” I asked, pointing to a little miniature hanging underneath the portrait of his son, before which he had paused. ""No, your own,"" he replied. ""Tell me about her, uncle; I know so little, and often long for her so much,"" he said. ""I know so much, and yet I know little,” he said, “and often long so much for. ""You are a youthful image of her, Sybil’s youthful image,” my uncle said. “Go on please, tell me more; tell me why this is so stained and worn; you know all, and surely I am old enough now to hear any history of pain and loss.” “Just before your birth your father was obliged to cross the Channel, to receive the last wishes of a dying friend; there was an accident; the vessel foundered, and many lives were lost. He escaped, but by some mistake his name appeared in the list. “I am civil when you leave me alone; I do agree to marry her, but I won’t be hurried or go a-wooing except in my own way. You know I never liked the bargain, for it’s nothing else; yet I can reconcile myself to being sold, if it relieves you and gives us both a home” “Kind as was both act and speech, neither touched me, for something seemed wanting.”“It is yours now, my child; keep it, and never feel that you are fatherless or motherless while I remain.’. “I should be in prison and you a houseless vagabond. Trust me, my boy, and take the good fortune which I secured for you in your cradle. But, father, mind this, if you tie me to that girl’s sash too tightly I shall break away entirely, and then where are we?” “I think she’ll not refuse, sir; she likes me already. I see it in her eyes; she has never had a lover, she says.”"

Especially beautiful and attractive did he look as he pranced on the. Cupid was a young man who lived in a small town. He liked the little girl who lived with him. She was a mixture of sweet and sour, he thought. He loved her name, Chow-chow, which suggested Indian sweetmeats. She had fled, and he had to get at her. The little girl was a little girl. She lived with a family of mammas.. Cupid, a little boy, was a truant who loved to do the honors of his pleasant home like a gentleman. He ran after the truant, quite panting with eagerness and all aglow with amiable intentions. He embraced the little girl and said: ""Don't be frightened. I'm Cupid. I must kiss you"". ""I like you very much. I always do when people come, and I like youvery much."" With this soothing remark, the velvet arm pressed her firmly, and the lips gave her several soft kisses. But Chow-chow's wrath was great, her vengeance swift, and getting one hand free she flung the gravel it held full in the flushed and smiling. Cupid found Chow-chow on her father's knee eating cake, while the elders talked. ""I don't like crying boys,"" returned the heard-hearted damsel. ""Well, you made me; but I forgive you,"" Cupid magnanimously put out his hand for a friendly shake.. Cupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes, then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in the mingled joys of eating macaroons. ""I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of. ""Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they may not be put down as we are,"" returned Mrs. Susan. ""Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours, Chow-chow; give us your views generally,"" said Mrs.Susan.. ""This is our platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti Woman's Puckerage for ever!"" ""Now, then, who is in favor of the Elective Franchise?"" said Uncle George, with a twinkle of the eye. ""Only fun, my dear,"" said Aunt Susan. ""It's only fun."" ""It is only fun!"". ""I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond his comprehension,"" said Mrs. Susan. ""I shall teach him to be as good and just a man as his father,"" returned Mrs.Susan.. ""We shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much tenderness,"" said Aunt Susan. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who nodded back as if they quite understood one another. The elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got on together and were much amused.. Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults. Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming them.. Cupid colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror. His mother expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last slap. But to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without a word. He asked in a very earnest voice, ""Mamma, am I vain?"". Cupid went back to Chow-chow, bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the other. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction, ""You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on her. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and said, smiling, ""I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all"" But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom. She laid the yellow locks away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him more beautiful.. Cupid the cat adored Chow-chow, but she frowned upon his little passion and gave him no hope. She told him he was a 'fraid cat' and refused to be kicked by a horse. She also told him not to turn a hay-cutting machine. He refused to turn it, and she poked it with a hoe.. ""I can bear it harder than that,"" said devoted Cupid. Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze. Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and reversed the handle. He drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, ""She didn't mean to do it"". Chow-chow stood by quite white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother a arms. Then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to be comforted.. Cupid, who had often sued for a good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with a penitent kiss, ""I truly didn't mean to, Coopy"" ""Just say I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger,"" she said.. The boy would submit the poor swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips, damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against his mother for a minute.. ""It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn it early,"" said aunt Susan. ""It is an important lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake,"" said gentle Mrs. Chow-chow. ""I am glad that Cupid is not a dandy-prat,"" said uncle George. ""Cupid is a very good man,"" said Aunt Susan, ""and he is very kind and. Cupid's papa watched the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in their daily lives. The finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint. Before this time, however, Chow-Chow, touched by his brave patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his faithful affection,. Cupid, the Chinese prince, was enamoured by his sweetheart, Chow-chow. But his finances were in a bad state, and he spent his pocket-money as fast as he got it. He decided to marry a poor boy, so now he was going to marry her.. ""A man who had a small hoard of money, and a button put in for fun, begged and borrowed small sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him"" ""When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That seemed a fortune to the innocent"" ""But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes"". ""O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough,"" pleaded poor Cupid. ""No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and you ain't half so pretty as you used to be,"" replied Chow-Chow.. ""But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way,"" he said. ""Don't you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait,"" he added.. Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they could. Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him tugging away with. The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an occasional squabble. A rainy day came, and the experiences it gave the little pair brought things to a crisis. A few attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui. The little pair were left to their own devices.. ""Let's play house,"" suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn, and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss. So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the other.. Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so doing. He pacified his spouse by praising her dessert, a sandwich of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr. Mr. CupID's wife suggested that the horse run away and they all go smash. ""It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smashing,"" he said.. Cupid's dramatic soul delighted in tragic adventures. So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor. When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid bundled her children off to bed,. Cupid wanted to go to Woman's Puckerage meetings with his idol. But his mother refused to let him go. Cupid decided to walk arm-in-arm with Chow-chow to the meeting. The lecture was not very interesting, but Cupid was so engrossed that he forgot to go home until he had finished it. The older pair in the other room laughed at the joke, yet felt that Cupid. Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore. She made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy. Mr. Cupid, feeling that they had a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his children.. The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse, went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings always ended near the ruins of his home.. The story of a monkey who lost her beloved friend is told in a novel called 'The Little Monkeys' The novel is the work of British author  Paul Auster, and is set in the early 1900s. It is the first of a series of novels about the lives of monkeys in Britain.. ""My boy will give in first. She had not the face to devour it alone. She could not make up her mind to give it to him. She was so overcome with emotion that she could not look at him. So she looked at the other side of the room. He looked at her. She looked at him and they. ""I hope my girl will remain true to her principles,"" says Aunt Susan. ""She'll be a miserable baby if she does,"" muttered Uncle George. ""I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her fault and try to do better,"" adds Aunt Susan, fast and low..

Debby shook her head, and murmured, ""Hush!""--but Aunt Pen had heard of matches being made in cars aswell as in heaven. As an experienced general, it became her to reconnoitre, when one of the. Dora's aunt put a green veil over her niece's bonnet to shield her face from the eye of man. The clerk offered his services in procuring acarriage or attending to luggage; but Mrs. Carroll informed him that herservants would attend to those matters.. Debby's day was happier for that silenthour, her life richer for the aspirations that upliftedher like beautiful strong angels, and left a blessing when they went. Under her simplicity ofcharacter and girlish merriment Debby possessed adevout spirit and a nature full of the real poetry oflife. The gifts that gave her dawning womanhoodits sweetest charm, and made her. Debby was a young girl when she fell in love with the sky. The sky and the morning red seemed to linger on her cheek, and in her eye arose a light kind. ""Your mamma would not flatter me, Mademoiselle,"" said Victorine. ""Drop that braid half an inch lower, and pull the end of her handkerchief out of the right-. Debby sat mute, with the air of a child in its Sunday-best on a week-day. Joe Leavenworth, a ""man of the world,"" paused in his account of an excitingrace to make the announcement.. ""The girl is well got up, but has no style, andblushes like a milkmaid. Better fight shy of her,Joe."" ""She's new, you,see, and I geton with that sort of girl the best, for the old onesare so deused knowing that a fellow. Debby was down rather late, and AuntPen concentrated her energies upon the achievement of a copious repast. After the flutter occasioned bybeing scooped into her seat by a severe-nosedwaiter, Debby had only courage enough left torefuse tea and coffee and accept milk. AuntPen glanced toward her niece with the comfortableconviction that her appearance was highly credit. Debby choked on her omelet. Aunt Pen said, ""For Heaven's sake, Dora, put away thatmess! The Ellenboroughs are directly opposite,watching everything you do"" ""I've been introducedto Mrs. Ellenborough,"" Debby said. ""She's a jolly little thing and. ""Joe Leavenworth, my dear, from one of ourfirst families,--very wealthy,--fine match,--pray,be civil,--smooth your hair, hold back your shoulders,and put down. ""I shall be most happy to show the lions: theyare deused tame ones, so you needn't be alarmed,"" said Mr. Leavenworth. ""We must endeavor tomake it pleasant for her, or she will be gettinghomesick and running away to mamma,"" said Aunt Pen.. Debby asked Mr. Leavenworth, ""Can you skip a stone?"" He asked, ""Eh? what's that?"" She illustrated it by sending a stone skimming over the water in themost. ""You'll be at the hop to-night, I hope, MissWilder,"" he said. ""Yes, indeed; for dancing is one of the joys ofmy life, next to husking and making hay,"" she replied.. ""Hay; ah, that is the pleasantest fun in the world,--and better exercise, my mother says, forsoul and body, than dancing till dawn in crowdedrooms,"" he. As she spoke, Debby looked up, expecting tomeet a glance of disapproval; but something in thesimple earnestness of her manner had recalledcertain boyish pleasures as innocent as they werehearty.. ""I used to fancy that sort of thing years ago,but I'm afraid I should find it a little slow now,"" he said. ""I would be tempted to try it, if a hay-cock came in my way,"". . Between ourselves, there's a deal ofhumbug about this kind of life, as you will find, when you've tried it as long as I have. The milk of human kindness had been slightlyc. ""There's no justice in the world, no chance for us young people to enjoy ourselves,"" says Joe. ""There are no end ofgossips and spies who tattle and watch till you feelas if you lived in a lantern,"" he adds. ""You have to keep yourwits about you in the most exhausting manner, oryou. Debby laughed behind her parasol at this burst of candor. ""Thank you for your warning, but I don'tapprehend much annoyance of that kind,"" she said. Mr. Leavenworth turned away, with a convicted sort of expression, as she spoke, and, makinga spyglass of his hand, seemed to be watchingsomething out at sea with absorbing interest. ""Do you know, I think, if youngladies were truth. ""By-the-by, Miss Wilder, as I've engaged todo the honors, shall I have the pleasure of bathing with you when the fun begins?"" ""Yes, Aunt Pen means to put me through a course of salt water, and any instructions in the art of navigation will be gratefully received,"" said Debby.. Carroll hove in sight,coming. Debby met her without a freckle, looking all the better for her walk. Aunt Pen never chid her for thedestruction of her raiment. Debby's feet were wet withchasing the waves, and her pretty gown the worsefor salt water.. Debby's bright face clouded over, and shewakked on with so much stateliness that her escortwondered "" what the deuse the old lady had doneto her. ""You aredoing beautifully! He is evidently struck; makeyourself interesting, and don't burn your nose. The sea washed paint andpowder from worn faces, and left a fresh bloomthere. Leavenworth was in waiting, and so like ablond-headed lobster in his scarlet suit that Debbycould hardly keep her countenance as they joined the groups of bathers gathering.. Debby vaguely felt this charm, and, yieldingto it, splashed and sang like any beach-bird. Old men gathered shells with the little Cupids dancing on the sand. Young mothers never looked sobeautiful as when they rocked their babies on thebosom of the sea. No fashion ruled, but thatwhich is as old as. ""Miss Wilder, you must learn to swim. I'vetaught quantities of young ladies, and shall bedelighted to launch the 'Dora,' if you'll accept meas a pilot"". ""I can't dive, but there is a man,"" she says. ""He's a man. He's a stranger."" ""I'm going to get him,"" she adds. ""I've got to go"". ""Oh, I'm very glad it's you, Sir!"" was Debby'scordial greeting, as she shook a drop off the end ofher nose, and nodded, smiling.. ""What have you lost? I will look for it, if it is a human,"" she says. ""It is a set of teeth,"" she adds. ""I am looking for them."" ""I will find them,"" she replies. ""But first, let me show you what I have."". Mr. Evan was guilty of a secret wishthat all the worthy lady's features were at thebottom of the sea, that he might have the satisfactionof restoring them to her attractive niece. But curbing this unnatural desire, he bowed, saying,gravely, ""Tell your aunt, if you please, that this littleaccident will remain"
0.79,0.89,62.296048751720065,"Two little boys sat on the fence whittling arrows one fine day. Said one little boy to the other little boy, ""Let's do something jolly"" ""All right. What will we do?"" ""Run off to the woods and be hunters."" ""What can we hunt?"" ""Bears and foxes"" ""We can shoot squirrels and snare wood-chucks"" ""I've got a lot of things we could use"". ""There, sir, that's a first-rate fit-out for hunters,"" said Tommy. ""If you are afraid, stay at home; I'm going to have no end of a good time,"" said Billy. ""Where shall we sleep?"" asked Billy, who liked to be comfortable both night and day. ""Oh, up in trees or on beds of leaves, like the fellows in our books,"" replied Tommy, ""Pooh! I ain't afraid"" ""And with the jolly basket of lunch Mrs. Mullin gave us, we can get on tip-. ""Do you know the way?"" panted Billy, when at last they stopped for breath. ""Yes, it winds right up the mountain; but we'd better not keep to it, or some one will see us and take us back"" ""What will our mothers say if we really get lost?"" asked Billy, always ready with a question. ""Mine won't fuss,"" replied Tommy. ""Come on!"" said Billy. ""We are going to be real hunters and have adventures"" ""We must get lost, and find our way by the sun and the stars,"" said Tommy. 'We are not going to get lost. We are not running away. We're going to have adventures."". ""I guess I'll risk it, and have some fun to tell about when we go home,"" said Billy, trudging after Captain Tommy, who always took the lead. ""My mamma lets me do what I like,"" said Tommy. ""She's always afraid I'm going to get hurt, so I'm careful."" ""I'm not afraid of anything,"" said Captain Tommy. 'I'm just going to go along and have fun."" ""Yes,"" said the captain. ""I'll go with you."" ""No, I'm not going with you,"" said his mother. ""You're going to lead us."" ""We're going into the bush."" ""What?"" ""We'll go into the forest."" "". ""Don't you call this nice?"" asked Tommy, pausing at last in a little dell where a noisy brook came tumbling down the mountain side, and the pines sung overhead. ""Yes; but I'm awful hungry. Let's rest and eat our lunch,"" said Billy, sitting down on a cushion of moss. ""You always want to be stuffing and resting,"" answered sturdy Tommy, who liked to be moving all the time. ""I'm awful Hungry,"" said Tommy, sitting on a cushioned cushion of Moss. ""Let's rest, and eat lunch."" ""Yes,"" replied Billy, and opened the fishing-basket.. Mullin had packed a nice lunch of bread and butter, cake and peaches, with a bottle of milk, and two large pickles slipped in on the sly to please the boys. All he saw was a box of worms for bait and an old jacket. ""We shall have to catch some fish and eat blackberries. Which will you do, old cry-baby?"" said Tommy, laughing at the other boy's dismal face. ""I'll fish; I'm so tired I can't go scratching round after berries,"" said Billy. ""You are always in such a hurry to start,"" said Mullin.. Tommy and Billy set up their camp in the woods. Tommy picked the berries and Billy bait his hook. They went to a quiet pool below and fished for trout. Tommy caught a few trout, but Billy couldn't catch one. Billy said: ""I don't love fish. I don't like worms, either"" The pair went back to their camp and set up a new one. They ate the berries, and Billy caught a fish. The pair set up another camp and ate fish again. The boys had a great time. They were very happy.. Tommy picked berries and picked dry sticks for the fire. He then set about cooking four trout. The boys ate the fish, but they were not cooked. Tommy said he would show them how to cook them. The trout were half cooked and eagerly eaten by the hungry boys. But they were very different from the nice brown ones Mrs. Mullin gave them; for in spite of Tommy's struggles they would fall in the ashes, and there was no salt to eat with them. They were not the best trout in the world, but the best they had ever had. They had been cooked by Tommy, and he had cooked them with bread and butter. They ate them with a little butter and bread, but no salt.. The young hunters were so hungry they could have eaten anything, and not a berry was left. ""You go and catch some more fish, and I'll see if I have caught any old fish,"" said Tommy. ""I've got him! Come and see! He's a bouncer,"" roared Tommy, from the berry bushes some way off. The trout had evidently gone to their dinners, and he was just falling asleep when a loud shout gave him such a fright that he tumbled into the brook up to his knees. The other boy went slowly back to the brooks, wishing with all his might he was at home eating sweet corn and berry pie. The young hunters had to wait until the last bone was polished before they could eat it.. Tommy found the animal fighting to get his paws out of the trap. He was a raccoon or a big woodchuck. The creature was very timid. We'd better run away and wait till he's dead,"" said Billy. The animal was a big, gray, raccoon. It was a very timid, gray animal. We'll have to leave him awhile, and get him when we come back. The other fellows will wish they'd come with us."" said Tommy, prancing to and fro, without the least idea what to do.. ""Can we ever eat him?"" asked hungry Billy, ready for a fried crocodile if he could get it. ""If he's a raccoon, we can; but I don't know about woodchucks,"" he said.. The sound of a gun echoing through the wood gave Tommy a good idea. ""Let's find the man and get him to shoot this chap,"" he said. ""Then we needn't wait, but skin him right away, and eat him too"" They found the man, resting in an old hut left by the lumbermen. ""He's nice and fat; we might try him when he's dead,"" said Tommy. ""I'm going to kill him now,"" said the man. ""You're going to shoot him now, aren't you?"". Two dirty, wet little boys suddenly appeared before him,--one grinning cheerfully, the other looking very dismal and scared as the dog growled and glared at them. The remains of his dinner were spread on the floor, and he lay smoking, and reading a newspaper, while his dog dozed at his feet, close to a well-filled game-bag. ""Who are you?"" asked the man. ""Hunters,"" said Tommy. ""Had good luck?"" And the man laughed. ""Pretty fair; but I want a shot at the bear,"" replied Tommy. ""People tell me there is one up here, and I'm after him; for he kills the sheep, and might hurt some of the young folks round here,"" said the man, loading his gun with a very sober air. ""I'd rather shoot a bear than any other animal but a lion. We don't have those here,"" he said. ""Mullin said he hadn't heard of one for a long time; so this must be a young one, for they killed the big one two years ago."" ""I hope you'll get him,"" said Tommy, who was very excited.. ""Oh, I say, let's go! Such fun, Billy! I know you'll like it. A real gun and dog and hunter! Come on, and don't be a molly-coddle,"" cried Tommy, wild to go. ""I won't! I'm tired, and I'm going home; you can go after your old bears if you want to,"" growled Billy, very cross at being left out. ""Can't stop. Good-by,"" said Tommy. ""Good-by, Billy!"" said the bear. ""You're not going to get hurt or lost."". ""Let's go and see how old Chucky gets on,"" he said good-naturedly, when the man vanished. ""Not till I'm rested. I can get a good nap on this pile of hay,"" said lazy Billy. ""Some day I'll come and take you out with me, little Leatherstocking,"" said the man, striding off with the dear gun and dog and bag. ""I just wish I had a boy with some go in him; you ain't much better than a girl,"" sighed Tommy, walking off to a pine-tree where some squirrels seemed to be having a party. He tried his bow and shot all his arrows many times in vain, for the lively creatures gave him no chance. He had better luck with a brown bird who sat in a bush and. Tommy felt sorry that its happy little life was so cruelly ended. He was ashamed that his thoughtless fun had given so much pain. Tommy smoothed the ruffled feathers of the dead thrush. He buried it wrapped in green leaves, and left it there where its mate could sing over it, and no rude hands disturb its rest. He will never shoot another bird except hawks after chickens, and I won't brag about this one. It was so tame, and trusted me, I was very mean to kill it. I'll tell mamma and she will understand: but I won’t tell Billy. Tommy scolded Billy for not going with the man, who knew his way and was probably safe in the valley when the last faint shot came up to them. They chewed sassafras bark and checkerberry leaves for supper, and grew more and more worried and tired as hour after hour went by and they saw no end to woods and rocks. Once or twice they heard the hunter's gun far away, and called and tried to find him. They climbed up and tumbled down, turned back and went round, looked at the sun and knew it was late. They tried to finding the woodchuck, but lost their way, and wandered deeper into the great forest till they came to a rocky place and. The boys were so tired they could hardly walk, and longed to lie down anywhere to sleep. Tommy suggested climbing a tree, after making a fire at the foot of it to scare away the bear, lest he climb too and get them. But, alas! the matches were left in their first camp, so they decided to take turns to sleep and watch. Every few minutes a trembling voice would call from above, ""Is anything coming?"" and an anxious voice would answer from below, ""Not yet!"" The boys were eventually able to sleep in a tree in the middle of the forest. The boys' story was told in a book called ""The Adventures of Billy and Tommy"" published in 1852. The book was written by Tommy, and published by the publishers of the same name, and. Tommy and Billy were roosting on a branch in the woods. Billy began to snore, and then Tommy felt so lonely he couldn't bear it. So he climbed to a lower branch, and sat nodding and trying to keep watch, till he too fell fast asleep. A loud cry, a scrambling overhead and then a great shaking and howling waked Tommy so suddenly that he lost his wits for a moment and did not know where he was. He looked up, expecting to behold a large bear eating his unhappy friend, but the moonlight showed him nothing but poor Billy dangling from a bough, high above the ground, caught by. Tommy had been dreaming of bears, and rolled off his perch. The belt was firmly twisted at the back, and Billy could not reach to undo it. There seemed no way but to unbuckle the belt and drop. That he was afraid to try; for the ground was hard, and the fall a high one. The branch was not strong enough to bear Tommy, though he climbed up and tried to unhook poor Billy. He could not get his legs round the branch to pull himself up. There was. Billy had just declared that he should be cut in two very soon if something was not done for him. Fortunately both belt and buckle were strong, so he hung safely, though very uncomfortably. Tommy racked his boyish brain to find a way to help him. They thought they heard a far-off shout, and both answered it till their throats were nearly split with screaming. ""I seem to see a light moving round down that way,"" cried Billy from his hook, pointing toward the valley. ""They are looking for us, but they won't hear us,"" answered Tommy, glad to do anything that would put an end to this dreadful state of things.. ""Hold on, and we'll soon get you down,"" answered Tommy. ""I'm going to try and climb up that tree again"" ""I'll try to climb up it again,"" said Tommy. 'I'll see you later, Tommy."" ""I will,"" replied Tommy, ""and I'll climb up the tree again."" ""Yes,"" said the boy, ""you will,"" and they climbed up. The story of a lost man in the mountains. The man was found in an old bear-trap. He tried to get out of the pit, but was too stiff with weariness and the fall to be very nimble. He shouted, and whistled, and raged about very like a little bear caught in the pit. The sound of a gun roused him and he tried to escape. But it was too deep and he was too tired to know or care about anything. He was only dimly conscious that somebody was lost in a tree or a well, and that, on the whole, running away was not all fun. He lay still for some time in a sort of daze, too tired.. Tommy thought of all the stories he had lately heard at the farm, and began to wonder how it would feel to starve to death down there. He wished poor Billy could come to share his prison, that they might die together, like the Babes in the Wood, or better still the Boy Scouts lost on the prairies in ""Bill Boomerang, the Wild Hunter of the West"" ""I always wanted to sleep out, and now I'm doing it. Wish poor Billy was safely down and in this good bed with me"" ""It's rather good fun, though, if they only find me. I ain't afraid, and it isn't very cold."" ""I guess mother is worried this time, because I never stayed out all night before, and I never will again without leave"". Tommy's meditations ended in a series of yells as loud as his shrill little voice could make them, and he thought some one answered. But it must have been an echo, for no one came. After another rampage round his prison, the poor boy nestled down among the leaves, and went fast asleep because there was nothing else to do. The hunter on his return to the hotel had reported meeting the runaways and his effort to send them home in good season. So people knew where to look, and, led by the man and dog, up the mountain went Mr. Mullin with his troop. Their distracted mothers meantime were weeping and wringing their hands at the farm, while all the men in the neighborhood were out. The hunt was, on the whole, rather easy and pleasant at first, and lanterns flashed through the dark forest like fireflies. But as time went on, and no sign of the boys appeared, the men grew anxious, and began to fear some serious harm had come to the runaways. ""He's a boy after my own heart, spry as a chipmunk, smart as a young cockerel, and as full of mischief as a monkey,"" said Mr. Mullin. ""I shouldn't be a mite surprised to find him enjoyin' himself first-rate,"" said his friend. ""The fat boy won't take it so easily, I fancy,"" said the other. ""If it hadn't been for him I'd have kept the lively fellow with me, and shown him. ""Maybe they've fell down a precipice and got killed, like Moses Warner, when he was lost,"" suggested a tall fellow, who had shouted himself hoarse. ""Hush up, and come on! The dog is barkin' yonder, and he may have found 'em,"" said the farmer, hurrying toward the place where the hound was baying at something in a tree. It was poor Billy, hanging there still, half unconscious with weariness and fear. The belt had slipped up under his arms, so he could breathe easily; and there he was, looking like a queer sort of cone on the blasted pine.. Tommy's hat lay on the ground; and showing it to the dog, his master told him to find the boy. The good hound sniffed about, and then set off with his nose to the ground, following the zigzag track Tommy had taken in his hurry. The hunter and several of the men went after him, leaving the farmer with the others to take care of Billy. The little round face seemed very quiet; and for a moment the men stood quite still, fearing that the fall might have done the boy some harm. Then the hunter leaped down, and gently touched the brown cheek of the boy, who had fallen into a bear-pit. The men were much relieved; and rushing on soon saw the good beast looking down at a little white object in one corner of. ""Wake up here, little chap; you are wanted at home. Had hunting enough for this time?"" Tommy opened his eyes, gave a stretch, and said, ""Hollo, Billy,"" as calmly as if in his own bed at. ""Did you shoot the big bear?"" he asked, looking up at the man with a grin. ""No; but I caught a little one, and here he is,"" answered the man. ""I left him up a tree like a coon, and he wouldn't come down,"" laughed Tommy. ""He's quite ready to get up now,"" said the man who had been sitting with them. ""We're going to get him out of the pit,"" he said. ""But he's not going to come out of it now,"" replied the man, ""because he's so tired."". The boys were found by a group of men on a hilltop. The men blew tin horns to let them know they had found the children. The boys were taken home by the men, who cooked them a late supper. The children were then taken back to their home in the hills. The story was told by the boys, and the story was passed down through the generations. The tale was passed on to the present generation by the children's descendants. The stories were passed down from generation to generation, and were passed on by the descendants of the boys' forebears, until they were all old enough to remember the story."
0.73,0.83,53.44426552156021,"""O Pris, Pris,"" said Kitty, ""I'm really going! Here's the invitation--rough paper--Chapel--spreads--Lyceum Hall--everything splendid; and Jack to take care of me!"" Priscilla looked up from her work with a smile of satisfaction on her quiet face. ""A stitch in time saves nine,"" she said, ""and Jack is kind to me"" ""What shall I wear?"" asked Kitty. ""Your white muslin, silk sacque, and. ""I'll never wear that old muslin again,"" said Kitty. ""It's full of darns, up to my knees, and all out of fashion,"" said Pris. ""I've got the ten dollars grandpa sent me, and with eight of it I'm going to buy Lizzie King's organdie muslin,"" Kitty said. ""Let us hear."" And Pris took up her work with an air of resignation. ""Though I hardly dreamed of going, I amused myself by thinking how I could manage if I did get invited,"" she said.. Kitty's aunt gave her the dress in Paris, but she can't wear it because she's bigger than she is. The dress is white with blue stripes and daisies in the stripes, and can't be got here. The skirt is cut off and gored, with a splendid train. Kitty will wear it to Class Day, if I never have another gown to my back!"" Pris says. ""Go on!"" says Kitty. ""I do!"" says Pris. ""It's the loveliest thing you ever saw, andcan't beGot here!"" said Kitty, with immense decision.. Kitty was so happy, so pretty, and full of girlish satisfaction, that sister Pris couldn't bear to disturb the little plan. They were poor, and every penny had to be counted. Pris saw things with the prudent eyes of thirty, but Kitty with the romantic eyes of seventeen. The elder sister, in the kindness of her heart, had no wish to sadden life to those bright young eyes, or deny the child a harmless pleasure. ""So simple, yet distingue, I know you'll like it. Next, my bonnet,""--here the solemnity of Kitty's face and manner was charming to behold. ""With my extra two dollars I shall buy my gloves, and pay my fares,--and there I am, all complete."". ""It is both bad taste and bad economy for poor people to try to ape the rich,"" she said. ""I'll run and get the dress, and we'll begin at once, for there is much to do, and only two days to do it in."" And Kitty skipped away, singing ""Lauriger Horatius,"" at the top of her voice. ""You're a perfect angel, Pris; so don't moralize. I'll run. Kitty was so glad and proud to tell, and show, and enjoy her little triumph that many half hours were wasted. The lovely muslin didn't hold out, and Kitty sacrificed the waist to the train, for a train she must have or the whole thing would be an utter failure. ""If she learns a lesson, neither time nor money will be lost."" said Kitty. ""Just this once let me do as others do, and thoroughly enjoy myself."" said Pris. ""She shall have her wish, and if she learns the lesson, both time and money will not be lost"". The gored skirt was a fearful job, as any one who has ever plunged into the mysteries will testify. A little sacque was eked out, however, and when the frills were on, it was ""ravishing,"" as Kitty said. The bonnet also was a trial, for when the lace was on, It was discovered that the ribbons didn't match the dress. Here was a catastrophe! Kitty frantically rummaged the house, the shops, the stores of her friends. There was no time to send to the city, and despair was about to fall on Kitty, when Pris rescued her.. ""Now the daisies; and oh, dear me, not one can I find in this poverty-stricken town,"" sighed Kitty, prinking at the glass. Pris heard the lamentations, and giving up fresh ribbons for herself, pulled her sister out of a slough of despond with two yards of ""heavenly tulle"" ""I see plenty just like those on your dress,"" answered Pris, nodding toward the. Kitty's outfit was ridiculous,--no one could deny that,--but youth, beauty, and a happy heart made even those absurdities charming. A pretty cluster was soon fastened just over the left-hand frizzle of bright hair, and the little bonnet was complete. ""Now, Pris, tell me how I look,"" cried Kitty, as she swept into the room late that afternoon in full gala costume. ""It would have been impossible for the primmest, the most sensible creature in the world to say that it wasn't a pretty. ""Now I could die content; I'm perfect in all respects, and I know Jack won't be ashamed of me,"" says Kitty. Lizzie King, in a burst of generosity, lent Kitty the blue and white Paris sunshade which she couldn't use herself. ""I hope you will enjoy every minute of the time, deary,"" says Lizzies.. Kitty was so absorbed in learning to manage her train that she forgot the facing till very late. She felt remorseful, till Pris was comfortably asleep, when she went to her room and revelled in her finery till bedtime. I thought this organdie would be more comfortable and appropriate this warm day. I was wrong. It was a very hot day. The train was in the middle of a journey.. ""Those girls"" were entirely extinguished by this stroke, and hadn't a word to say for themselves. Kitty casually mentioned Horace Fletcher, Lyceum Hall, and Cousin Jack, for they had only a little Freshman brother to boast of. ""She has made a regular guy of herself; I won't tell her so, and the dear little soul shall have a jolly time in spite of her fuss and feathers,"" said Jack. ""I'm not going to Lyceums. I'm going to Cambridge,"" said Kitty, ""and I'll be there all the time."" ""I'll be in the middle of the crowd,"" said the Duchess of Cambridge. ""And I'll have a good time."". ""Oh, thank you, Jack! Do I look nice, really? I tried to be a credit to you and Pris, and I did have such a job of it. I'll make you laugh over it some time. A carriage for me? Bless us, how fine we are!"" and Kitty stepped in, feeling that only one thing more was needed to make her cup overflow. ""I do wish she had let her hair alone and worn that pretty hat of hers,"" Jack said.. Kitty Heath was sitting in state with two gentlemen all to herself. She felt that she could forgive past slights, and did so with a magnanimous smile and bow. Jack and Fletcher had graduated the year before, but still took an interest in their old haunts. A pretty dress, sunshine, and somebody opposite, and they are blest, says Kitty Heath. The next thing Kitty knew she was rolling away with the elegant Horace sitting opposite. How little it takes to make a young girl happy! says Kitty, as she looks about her in the sunshine. ""A pretty dress,"" says Kitty. ""And somebody opposite"". Kitty's satisfaction was marred by Fletcher's desertion, and she could not see anything attractive about the dashing young lady in the pink bonnet to whom he devoted himself. Greeted by frequent slaps on the shoulder, and hearty ""How are you, old fellows,"" they piloted Kitty to a seat in the chapel. An excellent place, but the girl'satisfaction was marring by Fletcher’s desertion. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and the poem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professors yawn. Then the closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.. Kitty did have ""a rousing good time;"" for Jack was devoted, taking her everywhere. For the first time in her life, Kitty deliberately flirted. After he returned, she neglected Jack, who took it coolly, and was never in the way unless she wanted him. After they were married, Kitty became very fond of Jack. She was his ""first love,"" and he was her ""first lover"" They were married in May, and had their first child in July. The couple had a rousing affair, and Jack was very fond. After the wedding, they were very much in love, and were very close. They had a very happy marriage.. Kitty tried to enact the fashionable young lady, and, like most novices, she overdid the part. She tossed her head, twirled her fan, gave affected little shrieks at college jokes, and talked college slang in a way that convulsed Fletcher. Jack saw it all, shook his head and said nothing; but his face grew rather sober as he watched Kitty, flushed, dishevelled, and breathless, whirling round Lyceum Hall. Jack had proposed going, but Kitty had frowned, so he fell back, leaving her to listen and laugh, blush and shrink a little at her partner's flowery compliments and admiring glances.. ""She doesn't look like my little Kitty, and somehow I don't feel half so fond and proud of her as usual,"" said Jack. ""I promised Pris to take care of you, so I shall carry you off to rest, and put yourself to rights after this game of romps. I advise you to do the same, Fletcher, or give your friend in the pink bonnet a turn."" Kitty took Jack's arm pettishly, but glanced over her shoulder with such an inviting smile that Fletcher followed, feeling very much like a top, in danger of tumbling down the instant he stopped spinning. As she came out Kitty's face cleared, and, assuming her sprightliest air, she spread her plumage and prepared to descend with effect. Kitty Heath was walking down the stairs when she heard Fletcher exclaim, wrathfully, ""Hang the flounces!"" She saw a very glossy black hat come skipping down the steps, felt a violent twitch backward, and, to save herself from a fall, sat down on the lower step with most undignified haste. It was impossible for the bystanders to help laughing, for there was Fletcher hopping wildly about, with one foot nicely caught in a muslin loop, and there sat Kitty longing to run away and hide herself, yet perfectly helpless.. Fletcher freed her, and snatching up the dusty beaver, left her with a flushed countenance and an abrupt bow. He locked the door, and began to comfort her by making light of the little mishap. But Kitty cried so tragically, that he was at his wit's end, till the ludicrous side of the affair struck her and she began to laugh hysterically. She was so overcome with laughter that she had to be led away. She had been crying for an hour, and was so humiliated that she. Jack was about to empty the contents of an ice-pitcher over her, when she arrested him, by exclaiming, incoherently, ""Oh, don't--it was so funny!"" Jack laughed in spite of himself at the wretched little object before him, for dust, dancing, and the downfall produced a ruinous spectacle. That broke Kitty's heart; and, spreading her hands before her face, she was about. to cry again, when the sad sight which met her eyes dispelled the gathering tears.. Kitty's new gloves were both split up the middle and very dirty with clutching at the steps as she went down. Jack tenderly suggested a rest on the old sofa, and a wet handkerchief on her hot forehead, while he got the good landlady to send her up a cup of tea. ""No matter for my hands, I mourn my gloves. But I won't cry any more, for my head aches now so I can hardly see,"" she said.. ""Bless the what's-its-name if it has settled him,"" cried Jack. ""He is a contemptible fellow not to stay and help you out of the scrape he got you into. Follow his lead and don't trouble yourself about him."" ""Well, he was rather absurd to-day, I allow,"" sighed Kitty, as she pinned up the treacherous loop which had brought destruction to her little castle in the air. ""Handsome eyes, white hands, and angelic feet don't make a man."" ""I'm not going to let you down, Kitty,"" said Jack, ""and I'm going to make. ""I'll come back and take you out to see the dance round the tree when you've had a bit of a rest,"" said Jack, vibrating between door and sofa as if it wasn't easy to get away. ""Oh, I couldn't,"" cried Kitty, with a shudder at the bare idea of meeting any one. ""I know I've had my punishment, Jack, and I don't need any more. Wait till you can do better, Kit."" ""I thought it had gone, already"" said Jack with an irrepressible twinkle of the eye that glanced at the draggled dress sweeping the floor.. ""I've lost them both by this day's folly,"" thought Kitty, as Mrs. Brown departed with the teacup. ""I don't care for Fletcher, for I dare say he didn't mean half he said, and I was only flattered because he is rich and handsome and the girls glorify him"" But I shall miss Jack, for he's been to me to-day! so patient, careful, and kind, though he must have been ashamed of me. To feel that you despise me is worse than all the rest"" She ended with a little sob, and turned her face away to hide the trembling of her lips.. ""I wish I'd minded Pris! then he would have respected me, at least,"" said Kitty. ""I wonder if he ever will, again?"" ""Yes, I do,"" replied Kitty, ""I do."" ""Oh, I wish I had minded him, then he'd respected me."" ""I wish he'd minded me, then I'd have respected him, at at least."" ""Yes. Oh, I did."" ""And I wish he. ""Neat but not gaudy; I'm a fright, but I deserve it, and it's better than being a peacock"" ""How good of you to bring me these! They are more refreshing than oceans of tea"" ""I'm a little friendless and forlorn, sitting there alone as twilight fell, and amused herself by wondering if Fletcher would come to inquire about her, or show any further interest in her"" ""It's better to be a fright than a peacocks"". ""I think I like the little gray moth better than the fine butterfly,"" returned Jack, who, in spite of his invitation, seemed to find ""moping"" rather pleasant. ""You are a rainy-day friend, and he isn't,"" said Kitty, softly, as she drew him away. Jack's only answer was to lay his hand on the little white glove resting so confidingly on his arm, and, keeping it there, they roamed away.. Jack and Kitty had made a little discovery,--no, not a little one, the greatest and sweetest man and woman can make. In the shame, gratitude, and half sweet, half bitter emotion that filled her heart, Kitty felt that to her Jack would never be ""only cousin Jack"" any more. All the vanity, coquetry, selfishness, and ill-temper of the day seemed magnified to heinous sins, for now her only thought was, ""seeing these faults, he can't care for me"" The dingy old houses might have been fairy palaces, for anything they saw to the contrary.. Kitty overheard Fletcher quizzing her for the amusement of Miss Pinkbonnet. It was feeble wit, but it put the finishing stroke to Kitty's vanity. She dropped a tear in her blue tissue retreat, and clung to Jack. She felt that she had never valued him half enough. She might have said with Portia, ""Oh, I wish I was a better girl!"" She did not say ""for his sake,"" but in the new humility, the ardent wish to be all that a woman should be, little Kitty proved how true her love was, and might have told Portia: ""I love you, Portia."" She said it with her heart, and it was true.. ""Never mind, and don't get angry, Jack. They are right about one thing,--the daisies in my bonnet were real, and I couldn't afford any others. I don't care much, only Pris worked so hard to get me ready I hate to have my things made fun of."" ""He isn't worth a thrashing, so we'll let it pass this time,"" said Jack, irefully, yet privately resolving to have it out with Fletcher by and by. ""Why, Kitty, I thought the real daisied the prettiest things about. Jack had meant to say something before she went, and was immensely surprised to find the chance lost for the present. He wanted to go home with her and free his mind; but a neighborly old gentleman having been engaged as escort, there would have been very little satisfaction in a travelling trio. He was very silent as they walked to the station with Dr. Dodd trudging behind them. Kitty thought he was tired, perhaps glad to be rid of her, and meekly accepted her fate. ""I'll wear them just to show that noodle that I prefer nature to art,"" she said.. ""Jack, I can't thank you enough for your kindness to your silly little cousin,"" she said. ""I never shall forget it, and if I ever can return it in any way, I will with all my heart,"" he replied. ""Good-night, my Kitty,"" said Pris, as her sister appeared an hour later. ""Have you had a good time, dear?"" asked Pris. ""Don't I look as if I had?"" said Kitty. ""Yes,"" replied Pris; ""and, throwing off her wraps, Kitty revolved slowly before her"". ""My gown is all dust, crumple, and rags, my bonnet perfectly limp and flat, and my gloves are ruined,"" she said. ""Yet my Class Day isn't a failure, for Jack is the dearest boy in the world, and I'm very, very happy!"" ""I've broken Lizzie's parasol, made a spectacle of myself, and wasted money, time, and temper,"" she added. ""I'm very happy, too,"" said her lover. ""Because Jack likes it, and so do I."" ""Because I intend to wear a great deal, because Jack likesIt, andSo do I,"" said Kitty."

We were two lone ladies, and had meant to. Mary Ann was to meet us at 24 Colville Gardens, Bayswater. We waited and waited for her, but she did not come. She came hurrying back to say that all the cabs were gone from the neighboring stand, and she had run to another, where,. ""Isn't it fun to go rattling round in this all-out-of-doors style, through a real London fog?"" said my sister.. ""You are sure you gave the man the right direction?"" I asked. ""Of course I did, and he answered, 'All right, mum' "" ""I'd give a good deal to be shut up, dry and decent, in a four-wheeler,"". ""I'm new come to London, mum, and ain't used to these parts yet,""—began the man. ""Good gracious! so are we; and I. ""He is tipsy; I smelt gin in his breath, and he is half asleep up there, I've no doubt, for we have passed one, if not two policemen, I'm sure"" ""Nonsense! you wouldn't know your own father in this. ""There's a station! I shall stop and ask, for I'm not going slamming and splashing about any longer!"" ""Ay, ay, mum,"" came the wheezy whisper, more wheeze than ever. ""Stop at this station-house and hail some one. Let Jarvey alone and he. The fog was rapidly extinguishing my voice, and anxiety quenching my courage. M's curls hung limp and wild about her face, and even M's spirits began to fail. I had not the remotest. ""Oh, L, don't be sarcastic and grim now! Do exert yourself and land somewhere. Go to a hotel. This horrid man must know where the Langham is"" ""I doubt if he knows any thing, and I am sure that eminently respectable house would refuse to admit such a pair of frights as we are, at this dis.

My first impulse was to stir up the sleeping wretch above, and this I did by energetically twitching the reins that hung loosely before our noses"". ""He's an M.P., and will see that you are fined for attempting to drive a cab when you know nothing of London"" ""Who's a-goin' to know any thing in such a blessed fog as this? Most cabbies wouldn't try to drive at no price, but I'll. ""Look, there's a respectable man just going into his house from that four-wheeled cab. Let us hail the whole concern, and get help of some sort"" ""Take this cab, madam; the driver knows what he is about, and will see you safely home"" ""I felt that my appearance was entirely against me, and really expected to be told. ""Rash woman, you'll never see your money again!"" cried M, hiding her Roman earrings and clutching her Etruscan locket, prepared for highway robbery if not murder. ""I did see my purse again and my money, also. ""I know now how the wandering Jew felt,"" said M, after a period of repose.

""Well, I'm so tired, I shall go to sleep, whatever happens, and you can wake me up when it is time to scream or run,"" said M, settling herself for a doze. The cab stopped, and the driver, not being a fixture, descended, and coming to the window, said, civilly,. ""No use, mum, describing it, for I can't see a thing,"" said M.

0.39,0.49,36.16822429906542,"Louisa May Alcott ran away from her home in Boston in April 18th century. She was playing with some children who asked her to join them for a picnic. She wandered around the city for hours before it began to grow dark and she had to go home. The story was turned into a novel, The Little Engine That Could by Louisa May Alcot, published by Hodder & Stoughton, £16.99, in paperback.. Louisa's father and mother had missed her early in the forenoon and had looked for her in every place they could think of. Louisa was hungry and tired, too. She threw herself down on some door-steps to rest and to watch the lamplighter. A big dog came along and kissed her face and hands and then sat down beside her.. The town crier took Louisa by the hand and led her home, where you may be sure she was welcomed with joy. The next day after this last affair Louisa's parents made sure that she did not leave the house. Once when she was only two years old they were traveling with her on a steamboat, and she darted away, in some moment when no one was noticing her.. Louisa was a good child, so she felt much ashamed that she had caused her mother, whom she loved dearly, so much worry. As she sat there, tied to the sofa, she made up her mind that she would never frighten her so again. After that day, whenever she felt the least desire, she would hurry to her own. Louisa Alcott was a quiet, like-to-stay-at-home girl. By and by she found she liked making stories better than anything she had ever done in her life. Louisa did so and became one of the best American. Louisa Alcott wrote Little Men and Little Women. She was a nurse in the Civil War. She wrote a number of books, and if you begin with Lulu's Library, you will want to read Little Women and all the books that dear Louisa ever wrote. She taught school, did sewing, took care of children, or worked at anything, always with a merry smile, so long as it provided comforts for. Louisa May Alcott was a great traveler. She traveled to England, France, and Germany. She found boys and girls in England,"
0.48,0.58,30.446194225721783,"Marjorie sat on the door-step, shelling peas, quite unconscious whata pretty picture she made. Old Rover lay at her feet, the whitekitten purred on her shoulder, and friendly robins hopped about her. But the little maid neither saw nor heard, for her eyes were fixedon the green pods, and her thoughts. Marjorie's story is about a girl who is given gifts by fairies and robins. She is taken away by the prince in a chariot to reign over a lovely kingdom. The story ends with her giving the gifts back to the poor children in her realm. The book is published by Chatto & Windus, priced £7.99.. Marjorie was just finishing, when a voice called out from the lane. ""Hi, there! come here a minute, child!"" and looking up, she saw alittle old man in a queer little carriage drawn by a fat littlepony. Marjorie dropped a curtsy, sayingpleasantly, ""What did you wish,. Marjorie was smiling to herself as she watched the blue dragon-fliesdance among the ferns, a blackbird tilt on the alderboughs. So she proudly let down the rein, and when Jack wentsplashing into the brook, she stood on the bridge, waiting to checkhim up again after he had drunk his fill.. Marjorie's grandmother gave her a bank with all the money in it. Proudly displaying it on the railing of the bridge, she said, ""Granny gave it to me, and all themoney in it is going to be mine"" ""How will you do it?"" continued the inquisitive old man. ""Oh, I'm going to pick berries and dig d. ""Good little lass!"" said the old gentleman, as he put his hand in his pocket. ""Would you now?"" he added, apparently addressing himselfto a large frog who sat upon a stone. ""Well, perhaps itwouldn't be best on the whole,"" said the frog, who then did an undignified somersault into thebrook.. Jack walked out of the brook just then, and she ran to check him up. The old man laid a bright gold dollar in her hand,patted the rosy cheek, and vanished in a cloud of dust. Marjorie was so astonished at the grandeur of the gift, that she stoodlooking at it as if it had been a fortune. She said: ""Thank you, child--thank you. Here is something for your bank, andgood luck to. The Brownie was the good-luck penny he gave to Marjorie. She played the Brownie, and the penny came back to her. The Brownie had been a very good friend to her, and she was very happy to see him again. The penny was a gift from her father, who had died a few years before.. When she had told granny all about it, she got knife and basket, andwent out to dig dandelions. Up and down she went, sobusily peering and digging, that she. Marjorie was sitting under an umbrella in a meadow when she heard a pleasant laugh. She looked up and saw a slender little lady sitting under a large yellow mushroom. She thought: ""If there WERE any fairies, I'd be sure that was one"". Marjorie's hat was still fluttering over the grasslike a little cloud. The stranger said, ""Would you kindly catch my hat for me, before it blows quite away?"" Down went basket and knife, and away ran Marjorie. The cows stopped feeding to look on in placid wonder. The grasshoppers vainly tried to keep up.. Marjorie heard thelady singing, like the princess in the story of the Goose-Girl, ""Blow, breezes, blow!"" Marjorie drew near confidingly, and looked down at the wide-spreadbook before her. ""Now come and see what I am doing,"" said the lady. Marjorie saw a picture of her own little home, andher own little self on the door-step, all so delicate, andbeautiful, and true, it seemed as if done by magic. She gave a start, and laughed out with surprise anddelight. ""Oh, how pretty! There is Rover, and Kitty and the robins, and me!How could you ever do it, ma'am?"" she asked.. ""I wish the house and everything wouldstay pretty forever, as they will in the picture,"" said Marjorie. ""So do I,"" said the lady, in her happy voice. ""It is amazing how lovely common things become, ifone only knows how to look at them."" ""I wish I could make fair weather forourselves if we try,"" replied the lady.. ""I guess granny has found that out, for she never frets. I do, butI'm going to stop it, because I'm twelve to-day, and that is too old for such things,"" said Marjorie. ""Just believe thatthere is a sunny side to everything, and try to find it, and youwill be. Marjorie had never owned so beautiful a thing before. Would it please you to have this littlepicture?"" she added, lifting it out of the book. ""Truly my own? Oh, yes, indeed!"" cried Marjorie, coloring withpleasure. "" Hang it where you can see it often,and when you look. Marjorie put on a white apron in honor of the occasion, and,taking Kitty in her arms, went out to enjoy herself. The lords climbed trees and turned somersaults, theladies gathered flowers and told secrets under the sweetfern-bushes. The queen lost her shoe jumping over the waterfall, and the kingpaddled into the pool below and rescued it. That a fine banquet was. Marjorie stood on her throne watching the sunset while her maids ofhonor packed up the remains of the banquet, and her knights prepared the chariot. A happy little kingdom,full of summer sunshine, innocent delights, and loyal hearts; forlove ruled, and the only war that disturbed the peaceful land waswaged by the mosquitoes"

He was killed in the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. Collins' son, Tom, was also a soldier and served in the war. Tom was killed during the battle of Gettyburg in 1863, and was buried in a shallow grave. The family moved to Boston, where they lived with their family. Tom became a doctor, and Joe became a lawyer. The two men were married in 1875, and had a son, also named Tom, in 1881.. ""Woolidge, ma'am,"" said the Maine man. ""It is rough on a feller leavin' his folks, for good, maybe"" ""I calk'late to do my duty, and do it hearty,"" he said. ""But it is rough"" ""Are you glad to go?"" ""There's two sides to that question,"" he replied. ""I'm glad to be going."" ""I am glad to see you go,"" said Woolidge. ""And I'm glad that you're going."". ""It is very hard. Do you leave a family?"" he asked. ""My old mother, a sick brother,--and Lucindy."" ""Wives are less patriotic than mothers,"" I began, but he would not hear LucindY blamed. ""I couldn't shirk, and here I be,"" he said. ""It was wus for her than for me, women lot so on not being disappointed"" ""I'm going to get married in a month or so,"" he added, ""and then I'll go home"". ""I know without asking. Give us your purse, and I'll make him as happy as a king,"" said the boy, laughing, as he looked up admiringly at our tall friend. ""When I git to work, I shall be all right: the first wrench is the tryin' part"" ""I promised to write and tell his mother how finely the regiment went off, and was just expressing a hope that we might meet again, for I too was going to the war as nurse"" ""The order to ""Fall in!"" came rolling down the ranks, and the talk was over,"" said Joe. ""I was just going to be a nurse, but now I'm a soldier too."". Tom and I watched for our man, as we already called him. Fearing Tom would miss our man in the confusion, I kept my eye on him till the boy came rushing up with a packet of tobacco in one hand and a good supply of cigars in the other. Not a romantic offering, certainly, but a very acceptable one, as Joe's face proved. There was just time for this, a hearty shake of the big hand, and a grateful ""Good-by, ma'am;"" then the word was given, and they were off. But it was a different scene now than in the first enthusiastic, hopeful days.. Young men and ardent boys filled the ranks then, brave by instinct, burning with loyal zeal, and blissfully unconscious of all that lay before them. Now the blue coats were worn by mature men, some gray, all grave and resolute: husbands and fathers, with the memory of wives and children tugging at their heart-strings. Little of the glamour of romance about the war now: they saw it as it was, a long, hard task; and here were the men to do it well.. ""There he is! The outside man, and tallest of the lot. Give him a cheer, auntie: he sees us, and remembers!"" said Tom. ""Yes, there he was, looking up, with a smile on his brave brown face, my little nosegay in his button-hole, and doubtless a comfortable quid in his mouth, to cheer the weary march"". I never expected to see Joe again; but, six months later, we did meet in a Washington hospital one winter's night. How like an old friend he looked, though we had only met fifteen minutes ago. How glad we were to be there to smile back at him, and send him on his way feeling that, even in a strange city, there was some one to say, ""God bless you, Joe!"" We watched the tallest blue cap till it vanished, and then went home in a glow of patriotism,--Tom to long for his turn to come, I to sew vigorously on the gray gown the new nurse burned to wear as soon as possible.. A train of ambulances had left their sad freight at our door, and we were hurrying to get the poor fellows into much needed beds. All forms of pain were in my ward that night, and all borne with the pathetic patience which was a daily marvel to those who saw it. I found a very tall man who seemed to be already asleep or dead, so white and still and utterly worn out he looked as he lay there, without a coat, a great patch on his forehead, and the right arm rudely bundled up. I was rushing up.. ""Can you eat?"" I asked, as he said, ""Thanky, ma'am,"" after a long draught of water and a dizzy stare. ""Eat! I'm starvin'!"" he answered, with such a ravenous glance at a fat nurse who happened to be passing, that I trembled for her, and hastened to take a bowl of soup from her tray. ""So many such faces had passed before me that winter, I. Joseph Collins was taken to hospital with a head and arm wound. The hospital card had the name ""Joseph Collins"" on it. The patient was Joe Collins, a man who had lost his right arm in an accident. Joe Collins was the patient at the hospital in London, England. He was a man named Joseph Collins. He had been taken to the hospital by a man called ""Wal"" for an injury to his arm. The man had been shot in the head and had lost all of his left arm. He said that his arm had flown away, with no prospect of coming back.. ""I guess it won't do much lumberin', so that trade is done for. I s'pose there's things left-handed fellers can do, and I must learn 'em as soon as possible, since my fightin' days are over"" ""If you could just drop a line to mother to let her know I'm alive, it would be a sight of comfort to both of us"" ""Keep up your spirits, Joe; and we will soon have you fitted out with a new arm almost as good as new"". He must have been suffering terribly, but he thought of the women who loved him before himself. ""I guess I'm in for a long spell of hospital, and I'd lay easier if I knew mother and Lucindy warn't frettin' about me"". ""He will have a hard time of it, but I think he will pull through,"" says the doctor. ""I don't want to be a burden,"" says a man with a bullet in his head. ""If I was able to do for mother, I feel as if I wouldn't mind steppin' out now"" ""I'm so glad I'm not a man,"" says another. ""It's a good thing I'm a man."" ""I've been through a lot,"" says one. ""But I'm glad I don't. ""You will have Lucindy to help you, you know; and that will make things easier for all"" ""I couldn't ask her to take care of three invalids for my sake. She ain't no folks of her own, nor much means, and ought to marry a man who can make things easy for her"" ""Well, I'll have to wait a spell longer before I say anything to LucindY about marryin' now"" ""And I'll do the best I can to help her out of this situation"". ""All right, ma'am;"" and Joe proved himself a good soldier by obeying orders, and falling asleep like a tired child, as the first step toward recovery. ""Don't worry about that, but get well, and go home as soon as you can."" ""For two months I saw Joe daily, and learned to like him very much, he was so honest, genuine, and kind-hearted"" ""I soon discovered that a visit from him was more efficacious than other cordials in cases of despondency"". Jim was evidently sick and selfish. Lucindy was a pretty, weak sort of a girl, with little character or courage to help poor Joe with his burdens. The old mother was very like her son, and stood by him ""like a hero,"" as he said, but was evidently failing. She begged him to come home as soon as he was able, that she might see him comfortably settled before she must leave him. The letters I wrote for him, and those he received, told the little story very plainly. He read them to me, and found much comfort in talking over his affairs, as most men do when illness makes them dependent on a woman. Jim was evidently Sick and selfish, to judge from the photograph cherished so tenderly under Joe's pillow.. ""I wouldn't miss makin' her last days happy, not if it cost me all the arms and legs I've got,"" said Joe, as he awkwardly struggled into the big boots an hour after leave to go home was given him. Her courage sustained his, and the longing to see her hastened his departure as soon as it was safe to let him go. It was pleasant to see his comrades gather round him with such hearty adieus that his one hand must have tingled. To find tears in many eyes beside my own when he was gone, and nothing was left of him but the empty cot, the old gray wrapper, and his name upon the wall. I. The story of a Maine man who became a war hero is one of the most memorable of my life. He was a messenger for the British army, and was sent home after the war. He sent me a letter, but I never saw him again. He died in the war, but his story remains with me. I will always remember him, and his story, as one of my most memorable moments in life. I hope he will be proud of his story. I am proud to have been part of his life, and I hope I have made a difference to his. I wish he had been able to see me in my youth. I would like to thank him for his time.. The Red Cap, as I called him, plodded on through fair weather or foul. He was intent on doing well the one small service he had found to do. I liked the steady way in which he ploddled on through the bad weather.. ""I liked his cheerful whistle as he stood waiting for a job under the porch of the public building where his slate hung"" ""I often planned to give him a job, that I might see him nearer; but I had few errands, and little Bob, the hall-boy, depended on doing those"" ""A parcel came for me one day, and bidding the man wait for an answer, I sat down to write it."" ""I found out that my Red Cap was an old friend. I was glad to see him again"". ""I mistrusted it was you, ma'am, soon's I see the name on the bundle, and I guess I ain't wrong,"" says the man. ""Why, how you have changed! I've been seeing you every day all winter, and never knew you,"" I said, shaking hands with my old patient, and very glad to see him. ""Sit down and warm yourself while you tell me all about it; there is no hurry for this answer, and I'll pay for your time,"" he said. ""I haven't got any home nor any folks neither;"" and the melancholy words banished the brightness from his rough face like a cloud. ""Mother died soon after I got back. Suddin', but she was ready and I was there, so she was happy"". ""But Lucindy, where was she?"" I asked very naturally. ""Oh! she married another man long ago. She's doin' well, I hear, and that's a comfort anyway"" There was a look on Joe's face, a tone in Joe's voice as he spoke, that plainly showed how much he had needed comfort when left to bear his misfortunes all alone. ""I don't mind roughin' it,"" he said.. ""How came you here, Joe?"" I asked, making a sudden leap from past to present. ""I had to scratch for a livin', and can't do much,"" he said. ""There ought to be a comfortable place for such as you to spend your last days in. I am sure you have earned it."" ""Wal, it does seem ruther hard on us when we've give all we had, and give it free and hearty, to be left to knock about in our old age,"" he replied. ""A man can't set down and starve,"" he added.. ""Some kind people have been talking of a home for soldiers, and I hope the plan will be carried out"" ""That sounds mighty cheerin' and comfortable, thanky, ma'am"" ""I'd rather wear out than rust out,"" said Joe. ""But it will be pleasant to look forrard to a snug harbor bymeby"" ""You shall be one of the first men to enter that home, Joe, if I can get you there"" ""It will take time; but, if it comes to pass, you shall be the first,"" said the woman.. ""I feel a sight better just hearin' tell about it,"" says Bob. ""I feel as if every step took him nearer to the promised home,"" says Joe. ""After that day it was all up with Bob, for I told my neighbors Joe's story, and we kept him trotting busily, adding little gifts, and taking the sort of interest in him that comforted the lonely. ""I never looked out when he was at his post that he did not smile back at me,"" says the author. ""I never passed him in the street that the red cap was not touched with a military flourish,"" he adds. ""When we parted in the spring, I told him things looked hopeful, bade him be ready for a good long rest as soon as the hospitable doors were open,"" he says. ""But in the autumn I looked in vain for Joe. The slate was in its old place, and a messenger came and went on his beat, and this man had two arms and one eye"". The Home was an actual fact now, just beginning its beneficent career. People were waking up to this duty, money was coming in, meetings were being held. Already a few poor fellows were in the refuge, feeling themselves no longer paupers, but invalid soldiers honorably supported by the State they had served. A friend of mine said, ""By the way, there is a man boarding with one of my poor women, who ought to be got into the Home, if he will go"" I asked for Collins, but the new-comer had only a vague idea that he was dead. So I mourned for Joe, and felt that it was very hard he could not have lived to enjoy the promised refuge.. ""That sounds like my Joe, one arm and all"" ""I've a weakness for soldiers, sick or well."" ""A sad case, and in your line; I wish you'd look into it."" ""I'll go and see him; I've a weak spot for soldiers"" ""You'll never forget the pathetic little tableau I saw as I opened Mrs. Flanagin's dingy door"" ""It's a sad case of a man with one arm, trying to earn his bread tending babies with his one arm"" ""That's what I thought of him, too. A sad case"". How he managed with one arm to keep the baby from squirming on to the floor, the plate from upsetting, and to feed the hungry . ""They told me you were dead, and I only heard of you by accident, not knowing I should find my old friend alive, but not well, I'm afraid?"" ""There ain't much left of me but bones and pain, ma'am. I'm powerful glad to see you all the same"" ""Dust off a chair, Patsey, and let the lady set down,"" she said. ""I'm not going to ask you to help me, I just want to see my old friends again"" ""I'll be happy to help you,"" he replied. ""But I'll be glad to have you home again, too,"" she replied.. ""Why didn't you let me know how sick you were? And how came they to think you dead?"" I asked. ""I did send once, when things was at the wust; but you hadn't got back,"" he said. ""And then somehow I thought I was goin' to be mustered out for good, and so wouldn't trouble nobody,"" he added. ""But my orders ain't come yet, and I am doing the. ""That is very beautiful and right, Joe, and I honor you for it; but you were not meant to tend babies, so sing your last lullabies, and be ready to go to the Home as soon as I can get you there"" ""I ain't ashamed to pay my debts this way, sence I can't do it in no other;"" ""I used to lay and kind of dream about it when I couldn't stir without yellin' out; but I never thought it would ever come to happen."" ""I see a piece in the. ""I don't wonder you don't get well living in such a place, Joe. You should have gone home to Woolwich, and let your friends help you,"" I said. ""No, ma'am!"" he answered, with a look I never shall forget, it was so full of mingled patience, pride, and pain. ""I haven't a relation in the world but a couple of poor old aunts, and they couldn't do anything for me"" ""If you think I'd go to Lucindy, though she is wal off, you don’t know Joe Collins,"". ""I forgive, but I don't forgit in a hurry,"" he says. ""I'd die fust! If she was poor and I rich, I'd do for her like a brother"" ""I shall come for you in a few days,"" he adds. ""It won't take you long to pack up, will it?"" ""Yes,"" he replies. ""Yes, it will."" ""I'll be back in a week or two."" ""Yes. I will.""""I'll come back for you,"" he finishes. ""And I'll take the baby with me."" ""And the baby will come with me, too."". ""I'm awful shabby, ma'am"
0.37,0.47,30.864940798715633,"Nelly sat beside her mother picking lint. Her eyes often lookedwistfully out into the meadow, golden withbuttercups, and bright with sunshine. Presently she said, rather bashfully, but very earnestly, ""Mamma,I want to tell. Nelly thought it would be very pleasant to have alittle hospital all my own, and be a nurse in it. Could I, mamma?"" Her mother wanted to smile at the idea, but did not. ""Yes, Nelly, it will be a propercharity for such a. ""O mamma, how good you always are to me!Indeed, I am in truly earnest; I will learn,I will be kind,. Nelly's mother asked her if she would like to have a summer house. Nelly said yes, and ran to find the gardener's son, who was her favorite.. Tony pronounced the plan a ""jolly"" one, and, leaving his work, followed his young mistress to thesummer-house. Nelly could not wait one minute.. Nelly did as he advised, and very soon nothingbut dust remained. ""So it had,"" said Nelly, looking very wise allof a sudden. ""Will says the wards--that meansthe rooms, Tony--are scrubbed every day ortwo, and kept very clean"". Tony and Nelly were delighted with their new room. The walls shone white and the floor was dustless. The south wind blew away all musty odors with its fragrant breath. Nelly was looking anxious about the beds, however. Tony said: ""I'm afraid they wouldn't layeasy, not being used to it"". ""I'll make frames for nettings to the windows,else the doves will come in and eat up the sickpeople,"" said Nelly. ""I think they will know that it is a hospital,and be too kind to hurt or frighten their neighbors,"". Nelly, who loved all little creatures as she did, itgrieved her to have any harm befall even the leastor plainest of them. She had a sweet child-fancythat her playmates understood her language. Nothing seemed to fear the gentle child; butwelcomed her like a little sun who shone alike onall, and never suffered an eclipse. Nelly braid green nests for my patients, and, while I do it, mamma thought you'dread to me the pages she has marked. Tony let her decorate the sleeve of his grayjacket, and when the nettings were done, the welcome books were opened. Nina felt as if a new world had been given her, so full of beauty, interest, andpleasure that she never could be tired of studying it. Many of these things were not strange to Tony, because, born among plants, he had grown up with them as if they were brothers and sisters.. Will was a brave soldier, but his health had taken a turn for the worse. He was often gloomy, sad, or fretful, because he longed to be at his post again. His mother's visit to him made him laugh out loud, and he was happy to see her again.. ""You won't like to carry insane bugs, lametoads, and convulsive kittens in your hands,"" he said. ""I oftensee poor things suffering, and always feel as if they ought to be takencare of, as people are,"" he added. ""Yes, I will be a Sanitary Commission,"" he. ""I want four long bits of cane, asquare of white cloth, some pieces of thin wood,and the gum-pot,"" said Will, sitting up to examinethe little cart. ""Does this look like an ambulance, Will?"" asked Nelly. ""Not a bit, but it shall, if you and mammalike to help me,"" said her brother.. Nelly received her charitableplaything with a long sigh of satisfaction. ""I'd so like to give you the firstride,"" said Will. ""Nothing I should like better, if it were possible"" ""I've a prejudice against ambulances ingeneral,"" said Nelly.. Nelly said she would try to get out of the hospital to-day. Captain Willto say he had been too listless to leave his sofa. Nelly said: ""I know you will"" and walked away. The next morning the sun rose and Nelly was out in the garden. She said: 'I'll try and hop out to your hospital tomorrow'. Nelly was a happy child as she went smiling down the garden path. Papa, mamma, big brother andbaby sister, men and maids, all looked out to seethe funny little ambulance depart.. Nelly's kitten camerunning after to stare at the wagon and rub her softside against it. A large white onealighted on the top of the ambulance, walkedover the inscription as if spelling it letter by letter, then floated away.. Nelly had heard much about contrabands, knew whothey were, and was very much interested in them. When she freed the poor blackfly she played he was her contraband, and feltglad. Nelly found a pretty caterpillar dressed inbrown fur, although the day was warm. He lay so still she thought him dead, till he rolled himselfinto a ball as she touched him. ""I think you are either faint from the heat of yours, or that you are going tomake a cocoon of yourself, Mr. Fuzz,"" said Nelly.. Nelly, the nurse, found the beetle lying on his back kicking as if in a fit. She set the beetle on his legs, and did her best to comfort him. But he could not walk, and instead of liftinghis emerald overcoat, and spreading the wingsthat lay underneath, be turned over again, and kicked more violently than before.. Nelly found no patients in the garden except a dead bee, which she wrapped in a leaf, and took home tobury. But she came to another patient, over which she stood considering several minutes before shecould decide whether it was best to take it to herhospital. She knew it would not hurt her,yet she was afraid of it; she thought it pretty,yet could not. ""Some boywill kill him if I leave him here, and then perhapshis mother will be very sad about it"" ""Will said there were sickrebels in his hospital, and one was very kind tohim. It says, too, in my little book, 'Love yourenemies' I think. Nelly found a half-fledged bird, with onewing trailing on the ground, and its eyes dim withpain or hunger. Nelly ran to get both her chests, and, sittingdown beside the bird, tried to feed it. To herjoy it ate crumb after cr. Nelly bound both wings closely to his sides for fear he shouldhurt himself by trying to fly. Rob behaved verywell, only staring at her, and ruffling up his fewfeathers in a funny way that made her laugh. Nelly began to wonder how ithappened that she found so many more. Nelly looked around for the fairies. She had not yet lost her faith in them. She saw a pretty tent made of burdock leaves. Thestems were stuck into cracks between the boards. The tips were pinned together with a thorn. Nelly looked about on every side. The fairies were there.. Nelly looked around in the quiet meadow and shadygrove. Nothing wasseen but the quietmeadow and the shadygroves. Nothing heard but the babble of the brook and the cheery music of the bob. Nelly knew that theywere young field-mice, and rejoiced over them. She still believed them to have had a handin the matter. ""I shall call the mice my Babes in the Wood,because. Nelly knew this was a joke of Will's, but welcomed the ancient mariner. LittleRob was put in a large cage, where he could usehis legs, yet not injure his lame wing. Forked-tonguelay under a wire cover, on sprigs of fennel,for the gardener said that snakes were fond. Tony had not been idle while his mistress wasaway, and he showed her the hospital garden he had made close by. The Commodore wasmade happy in a tub of water, grass, and stones, and Mr. Fuzz was put in a well-ventilated glassbox to decide whether he would be a cocoon or not.. Nelly's patients prospered, and of the many added afterward few died, because of Tony's skilful treatment and her own faithful care. Every afternoon Nelly worked for the humansufferers whom she loved; and every evening brotherWill read aloud to her from useful books. It was Nelly'sholiday; but, though she studied no lessons. Nelly's work inspired other children to copy and copy her design. Tender-hearted playmates brought their pets to becured. Even busy farmers bad a friendly word for the small charity. Nelly's story is told in the book ""Nelly, The Little Ambulance"". Nelly never knew how much good she haddone Captain Will till he went away again in theearly autumn. Then he thanked her for it, and though she cried for joy and sorrow she neverforgot it. She had often asked Will for amotto for her hospital, and he had promised tofind her one. She dried her tears and went away to find comfort in the place where he had spent so many happy hours. Nelly sat indoors, lovingly brightening the tarnishedbuttons on the blue coat that had seen somany battles. She thought he had forgotten it;but even in the hurry of that busy day he hadfound time to do more than keep his word.. Nelly laughed at these comical mites till thetears ran down her cheeks, and thought she nevercould be tired of looking at them. But presently she saw four lines clearly printed underneath herpicture, ahd her childish face grew sweetly seriousas she read the words of a great poet, whichWill had made both compliment"

""Fortunate for us that we do get it, and have such gentle bosom guests to keep us brave and honest through the trials and temptations of a life like ours."". The men were friends as well as comrades, for though gathered from the four quarters of the Union, and dissimilar in education, character, and tastes, the same spirit animated all. The routine of camp life threw them much together, and mutual esteem soon grew into a bond of mutual good fellowship. A true New Englander, thoughtful, acute,. Flint, the long-limbed lumberman, from the wilds of Maine, was a conscript who, when government demanded his money or his life, calculated the cost. He decided that the cash would be a dead loss and the claim. ""The last words of a man from Illinois"" were spoken by a man named Flint. He was full of dash and daring, full of spirit and ready for a free fight with all the world. The man was killed in a car accident in the middle of the night.. The story of a man's home is told in the words of a young boy in the woods. The story is told by a boy who was left behind by his parents, who were killed in a car crash.. ""Thinkin' of my wife, and wishin' she was here, bless her heart! set me rememberin' how I see her fust, and so I roared, as I always do when it comes into my head."" ""I'm agreeable; but let us have your romance first,"" said Flint.. ""Halt a minute till I give a look, for this picket isn't going to be driven in or taken while I'm on guard,"" said Thorn. ""I didn't have to go out of my own State for a wife, you'd better believe,"" began Dick, with a boast, as usual. ""For we raise as fine a crop of girls thar as any State in or out of. ""Settle up them scores byme-by; fightin' Christians scurse raound here. Fire away, Dick."" ""A feller gets awfully kind of heathenish these times, don't he?"" ""I was visitin' Joe, didn't know folks round, and backed out of the beggin' part of the job"". ""I'd never found it till I see Kitty,"" he says. ""Pretty and plucky, good and gay was mine, but I'd never find it till she was here"" ""What was her good pints, hey?"" he asks. ""I've never seen one like them."" ""I'm not sure I've ever seen them like them, either,"" he replies.. ""Kitty didn't, but just wrastled with it like a good one, till she got it turned, banged, and spread to suit her,"" says the author. "" 'Plucky,' thinks I, 'better 'n' better.' Jest then an old woman came. ""I can't get in except by the Error! Hyperlink reference not valid entry window, and he'll see me,"" says Kitty. ""I'm dreadfully scared of ladders since I broke my arm off this very one. It's so high, it makes me dizzy jest to. ""She looked scared but stiddy, and I'll bet it took as much grit for her to do it as for one of us to face a battery"" ""I wish I may be hit if it wasn't a right down dutiful and clever thing to see done"" ""A snug little property wouldn't a ben. ""That's not all, is it?"" asked Thorn, taking a fatherly interest in the younger man's love passages. ""Not quite. 'Fore long, Joe whistled, and as I always take short cuts everywhar, I put in at the back-door, jest as Kitty come trottin' out of the pantry with a big berry-pie in her. 'Gay,' thinks I; 'go in and win' So I, did; made love hand over hand, while I stayed with Joe; pupposed a fortnight after, married her in three months, and there she is, a tip-top little woman, with a pair of stunnin' boys in her arms!"" Dick proudly displayed the likeness of a stout, much bejewelled young. ""Now, then, Flint, it's your turn to keep guard, and Thorn's to tell his romance"" ""It does a man good to talk of such things, and we're all mates here"" ""In some cases it don't do any good to speak of such. ""I think I could tell you almost anything if you asked me that way, my boy,"" he said. ""I guess there isn't now, and I'll tell you how I found my wife."" Dick sat up, and Phil drew nearer, for the earnestness that was in the man dignified his plain speech.. ""I never hear the number eighty-four without clapping my hand to my left breast and missing my badge,"" he says. ""You know I was on the police in New York, before the war, and that's about all you do know yet,"" he adds. ""One bitter cold night, I was going my rounds for the last time, when, as I turned a corner, I saw there. ""I'd seen her there when I went by before, and mistrusted she was up to some mischief"" ""She saw me the minute she did it, but neither dropped it nor ran, only stood stocks still with the apple in her hand till came up"" ""Better run home and get your supper then."" ""I've got no home."". ""I like to go there, it's warm and safe,"" the girl said. ""I longed to fling my billy at him,"" said the author. ""But I'd never had this sort of thing, nor seen that look on a girl's face"" ""I was new to the thing then, but though I'd heard about hunger and homelessness often enough, I'd. ""I ain't ashamed to say I felt so, seeing what a child she was,"" says the boy. ""It hurt me to feel how thin and cold it was,"" he adds. ""I suppose I did speaks kind of fatherly,"" he says. ""You'd better come to the Station for to-night, and. ""I've had nothing since yesterday morning, and maybe cold is easier to bear than hunger,"" she said. ""That's how I found my wife,"" he replied. ""Come, don't stop thar? I told the whole o' mine, you do the same."" ""I'll get you some supper,"" she replied.. ""I was always a soft-hearted fellow, though you wouldn't think it now, and when that little girl asked me to keep her safe, I just did it. I took her to a good woman whom I knew, for I hadn't any women belonging to me, nor any place but that to put her in. She stayed there till spring working for her keep, growing brighter, prettier, every day, and. ""Show us her picture; I know you've got one; all the fellows have, though half of 'em won't own up"" ""I once saved my little girl, and her picture once saved me."" ""I married her before the year was out"" ""She'd tried to get work, failed, spent all she had, got sick, and was going to the devil"". ""You'll like to show her this when you go home, won't you?"" said Dick, as he took up the bullet, while Phil examined the marred picture. Thorn poised the little thimble on his big finger, with a sigh. ""How can I, when I don't know where she is, and camp is all the home I've got?"". ""Boys, I've gone so far; I may as well finish,"" he said. ""It's only the old story,--I married her, worked for her, lived for her and kept my little girl like a lady. I should have known that I was too old, too sober, for a young thing like that"". She liked to be admired, to dress and dance and make herself pretty for all the world to see. Idleness wasn't good for her, it bred discontent. Some of her old friends, who'd left her in her trouble, found her out when better times came round, and tried to get her back again. She got courage, finally, to tell me that she wasn't happy; that she wanted to dance again, and asked. ""I resolved to take her away from temptation before worse came of it,"" he said. ""I didn't tell her my plan, but I resigned my place"" ""I filled her rooms with all the handsome things I could afford, and when it was done, I was as pleased as any boy"" ""She liked flowers, and I got her a bird, a kitten, and a dog to play with her. ""When I went to tell her and to take her to her little home, she was gone"" ""It was awful bitter to think I hadn't saved her, after all"" ""I found her dancing in Philadelphia, with paint on her cheeks, trinkets on her neck and arms, looking prettier than ever"" ""She loved the old life more than the new"". ""I couldn't stand that, and got out somehow. People thought me mad, or drunk; I didn't care, I only wanted to see her once in quiet and try to get her home"" ""I wrote to her, promised to forgive her, begged her to come back, or let me keep her honestly somewhere away from me. But she never answered, never came, and. ""I'll be repaid for all my patience, all my pain, by finding her again,"" he said. ""She knows how well I love her still, and if there comes a time when she is sick and poor and all alone again, then she'll remember her old John, and she'll come home and let me take her in"". ""Now I'll relieve Flint, and he will give you a laugh. Come on Hiram and tell us about your Beulah"" ""Just forget all this I've been saying, and go on as before,"" he said. ""I like to tramp, it seems like old times. ""It's done him good, and I'm glad of that; but I'd like to see the little baggage that bewitched the poor old boy, wouldn't you, Phil?"" Flint coiled up his long limbs, put his hands in his pockets, chewed meditatively for a moment, and then began with his slowest draw. ""I sent word I'd be 'long fore a gret while, and bymeby I went.

0.86,0.96,56.33111189056471,"The Art fever was a fashionable disease that struck a certain city. The young women of the community suffered from it with great violence. Nothing but time could cure it, and it ran its course to the dismay, amusement, or edification of the beholders. They begged potteries for clay, drove Italian plaster-corkers out of their wits with unexecutable orders, and caused a rise in the price of bread, paper, and charcoal, by their ardor in crayoning. The Art fever is now a thing of the past, and the young people of the city have recovered. But the Art fever will never be forgotten by the people of this city. It will always be a part of our history.. The Turner brothers were so absorbed in painting that they were unable to talk to the uninitiated. They had classes, lectures, receptions, and exhibitions, made models of each other, and rendered their walls hideous with bad likenesses of all their friends. Even in dress the artistic disorder was visible; some cast aside crinoline altogether, and stalked about with a severe simplicity of outline worthy of Flaxman. Others flushed themselves with scarlet, that no landscape which they adorned should be without some touch of Turner's. ""It was found impossible to keep them safe at home, and, as the fever grew, these harmless maniacs invaded the sacred retreats where artists of the other sex did congregate"" ""Some were blue in every sense of the word, and the heads of all were adorned with classic braids, curls tied Hebe-wise, or hair dressed a la hurricane. This irruption was borne with manly fortitude, not to say cheerfulness"" ""The atmosphere of romance began to pervade the old buildings when the girls came, and nature and art took turns"" ""I was coming up in a hurry when I ran against a man coming down in a haste"" ""It's a pity I didn't have more time for the girls,"" he says. ""I would have loved to have seen them all."". ""Not a bit of it; they are capital, and you are a regular genius, as we all agree,"" cut in the Homeric Miss Cutter. ""Never tell people they are geniuses unless you wish to spoil them,"" returned Psyche severely. ""Well, when the portfolio was put to rights I was going on, but he fell to picking up a little bunch of violets I had dropped,"" said Psyche. ""I didn't care for the dusty flowers, and told him so, and hurried away before any one came"" ""I always wear a posy into town to give me inspiration. I didn't want to be seen with them, but I did,"" said the artist.. ""Well, dear, considering that you didn't 'particularly look' at the man, you've given us a very good idea of his appearance. We'll call him Michael Angelo, and he shall be your idol. I prefer stout old Rembrandt myself, and Larkie adores that dandified Raphael,"" said the lively Cutter. ""Raphael is a dear, but Rubens is more to my taste now,"" returned Miss Larkins. ""He was in the hall yesterday talking with Sir Joshua, who had his inevitable umbrella, like a true Englishman. Just as I came up, the umbrella fell right before me. I started back; Sir Joshua laughed,. but Rub. Many would have pronounced it a clever thing; the nose was strictly Greek, the chin curved upward gracefully, the mouth was sweetly haughty, the brow classically smooth and low, and the breezy hair well done. It was perfectly thrilling. ""I feed upon a glance, a tint, a curve, with exquisite delight. Rubens is adorable (as a study); that lustrous eye, that night of hair, that sumptuous cheek, are perfect. He only needs a cloak, lace collar, and slouching hat to be the genuine thing."". ""Now I am perfectly satisfied with my Apollo, though you all insist that it is the image of Theodore Smythe. He says so himself, and assures me it will make a sensation when we exhibit,"" remarked Miss Larkins. But something was wanting; Psyche felt that, and could have taken her Venus by the dimpled shoulders, and given her a hearty shake, if that would have put strength and spirit into the lifeless face. ""What shall you do if it does not?"" asked Miss Cutter, with elegance. ""I shall feel that I have mistaken my sphere, shall drop my tools, veil my bust, and cast myself into the arms of Nature, since Art rejects me;"" replied Miss L. Psyche put the question to herself as she turned to work, but somehow ambitious aspirations were not in a flourishing condition that morning. Nothing went well, for certain neglected home-duties had dogged her into town, and now worried her more than dust, or heat, or the ceaseless clatter of tongues. Mother's querulous complaints spoilt the song she hummed to cheer herself, and little May's wistful face put the goddess of beauty entirely out of countenance. ""It's no use; I can't work till the clay is wet again. Where is Giovanni?"" she asked, throwing down her tools.. Psyche Dickenson went to find her friend Juno. Juno was being treated for a severe fit of ague. Psyche went up the stairs to the empty apartments. The apartment was on the western side of the park. She watched the feathery tree-tops ruffled by the balmy wind. The girl forgot herself, till a shrill whistle disturbed her day-dreams, and reminded her what she came for. She was looking for Juno, who was being cared for by Miss Dickenson. She went to see Juno. She found her bandaged and bandaged. Juno's face was plumper than the other. She had been treated for ague, and was being hydropathically treated. The Queen of Olympus had been given a bandage.. Giovanni, the errand-boy, was uncovering a clay model of a man. Psyche was glad of it, being tired to death of gods and heroes. She soon ceased to wonder what it was, feeling only the indescribable charm of something higher than beauty. She could see and enjoy the power visible in every part of it; the accurate anatomy of the vigorous limbs, the grace of the pose, the strength and spirit in the countenance. It was neither a mythological nor a historical character, Psyche thought, and was glad. She was not sure what the figure was, but it was a man, standing erect, and looking straight before him with a wonderfully lifelike expression.. Giovanni went away unseen, to fill his water-pail, and in the silence she just stood and looked. A majestic figure, but the spell lay in the face, which, while it suggested the divine, was full of human truth and tenderness. Pain and passion seemed to have passed over it, and a humility half pathetic, a. ""If I could do a thing like that, I'd die happy!"" she exclaimed impetuously, as a feeling of despair came over her at the thought of her own poor attempts. Her eyes kindled, her color rose, despondency and discontent vanished, and her soul was in her face, for she loved beauty passionately, and all that was best and truest in her did honor to the genius of the unknown worker. ""Who did it, Giovanni?"" she asked, still looking up at the grand face with unsatisfied eyes. ""Paul Gage."" he replied. ""I envy you more than I can tell!"" she said. ""You have done a wonderful piece of work, and I envy you!"". Psyche turned from the sculptor to his model with increased admiration in her face, and earnestness in her voice. He gave her a keen, kind glance out of the ""fine gray eyes,"" a little bow, and a grateful smile, saying quietly,--""Then my. ""Is doing one's duty a good way to feed heart, soul, and imagination?"" she asked. Paul answered emphatically, ""Excellent; for if one is good, one is happy, and if happy, one can work well"" He spoke with the energy of a man who believed what he said, and did his best to be worthy of the rich gift bestowed upon him. ""I have tried very hard to do it, but something is wanting; and in spite of my intense desire I never get on,"" he said. ""Moulding character is the highest sort of sculpture, and all of us should learn that art before we touch clay or marble."" ""I am a man of the world,"" he replied. ""A man who has been given a gift to do his duty well"". Giovanni looked at Psyche with round eyes, and she blushed deeply. The sight of her violets in a glass of water, and Giovanni staring at her, recalled Psyche to a sense of the proprieties which she had been innocently outraging for the last ten minutes. A sort of panic seized her; she retreated precipit. Psyche's father was a painfully prosaic man, wrapt in flannel, so to speak. His woollen mills left him no time for anything but sleep, food, and newspapers. Mrs. Dean was one of those exasperating women who pervade their mansions like a domestic steam-engine one week and take to their sofas the next. Psyche's parents were not very happy with her decision to study art at home, but she was determined to do it. She was a talented artist, and her father was proud of her. She wrote a book about her experiences, which was published in the early 1930s. The book was called ""Psyche"" and was published by Paternoster Square Press.. Psyche fell to work with a will, hoping to serve both masters at once. Sculpture and sewing, calls and crayons, Ruskin and receipt-books, didn't work well together. Poor Psyche found duties and desires desperately antagonistic. She might have done, perhaps, if flesh and blood had been as plastic as clay. But the live models were so exacting in their demands upon her time and strength, that the poor statues went to the wall. She had to give up her dream of being a sculptor. She was a woman, not a person. She couldn't be both. She could only be a woman. She gave up her dreams of being a person and became a sculptress. She had to quit her dream. She died of old age.. ""Wait a few years and see if you're not proud of me,"" said Psyche. ""Faith, and swate it is, thin!"" echoed Katy, whose red head had just appeared round the half opened door. ""Sculp away and do something, then I'll hurrah for your mud-pies like a good one;"" with which cheering promise the youth left, having effectually disturbed his sister's peaceful mood. ""I read in thy picture thy immortality!"" said Calista. ""As she spoke, her head sunk upon his bosom, and it was several moments before Claude perceived that he supported a lifeless form."". ""It's gingy-bread I'm making the day, miss, and will I be puttin' purlash or sallyrathis into it, if ye plase?"" ""Purlash, by all means,"" returned the girl, keeping her countenance, fearing to enrage Katy by a laugh. An hour of bliss, then came a ring at the door-bell, followed by Biddy to announce callers, and add that as ""the mistress was in her bed, miss must go and take care of 'em"" Whereat ""miss"" cast down her tools in despair, threw her cap one way, her bib another, and went in to her guests with anything but a rapturous welcome.. ""I didn't mean to be naughty, Sy, but mother is asleep, and the boys all gone, so I just came to be near you,"" she said, apologetically. ""The boys are very thoughtless. Come in and stay with me; you are such a mouse you won't disturb me,"" she added. ""I'm so lonely everywhere,"" she replied. ""It's so lonely here,"" said her sister. ""You're so small,"". ""Would you like to play be a model and let me draw your arm, and tell you all about the nice little bones and muscles?"" asked Psyche. May didn't look as if the proposed amusement overwhelmed her with delight, but meekly consented to be perched upon a high stool with one arm propped up by a dropsical plaster cherub. ""Can't you hold your arm still, child? It shakes so I can't get it right,"" she said,. Psyche's arm is so thin you can see the bunches nicely,--can't you?"" she asked the child. ""Yes, dear,"" said the child, looking at the winged cherub with sorrowful envy. ""I wish I was as fat as this white boy; but I get thinner every day somehow, and pretty soon there won't be any of me left but my little bones,"" said Psyche, dropping her work with a sudden pang at her heart. ""Don't, my darling; don't say that,"" cried Psyche. ""There doesn't seem. Psyche sat in the orchard drawing squirrels on the wall, pert robins hopping by, buttercups and mosses, elves and angels. May lay contentedly enjoying sun and air, sisterly care, and the ""pretty things"" she loved so well. ""I'm a sinful, selfish girl to keep you here! you're weak for want of air; come out and see the chickens, and pick dandelions, and have a good romp with the boys"" ""I don't want to play, Sy; but just to lie on the grass with my head in your lap while you tell stories and draw me pretty things as you used to"". All summer she did her best, but accomplished very little, as she thought; yet this was the teaching she most needed, and in time she came to see it. She did not find the task a hard one; for this time her heart was in it, and if she needed any reward she surely found it. The peace and beauty of nature soothed her own troubled spirit, cheered her heart, and did her more good than hours of solitary study. She was tired, rather discouraged, and almost heart-sick with the shadow of a coming sorrow. But she did not give up, and soon found her way back to her work. She had to go home to her family, to her husband, and to her friends. She would not have it any other way. She could not bear it.. In the autumn May died, whispering, with her arms about her sister's neck, ""You make me so happy, Sy, I wouldn't mind the pain if I could stay a little longer"" ""I must not think of myself, but try to comfort them;"" and with this resolution she gave herself heart and soul to duty, never thinking of reward. ""It was hard times for every one,"" Harry said, ""as Harry said,"" ""it was busy, anxious, humdrum winter"" Mr. Dean grew gray with the weight of business cares about which he never spoke; Mrs. Dean's face was more to her than any marble perfection her hands could have carved. ""If I can't, good-by, dear,. Sy Dean was the daughter of a man who died when his son was a baby. She took the place of the boy in the family and became a constant in his life. Sy Dean's strength increased with the demand for help from her family. She became a source of strength and comfort for the boys. She also became a model of patience and cheerfulness for her husband. She was a model for courage and skill for her family, and a model to be envied by others. She is now a widow. She has a daughter, who is a nurse. She lives in a nursing home in New York City.. Psyche's studio door remained locked till her brothers begged Psyche to open it and make a bust of the child. The boys found home very pleasant with Sy always there ready to ""lend a hand"" ""I'm afraid I've lost the little skill I ever had,"" said Psyche, ""but with great wonder and delight discovered that she could work as she had never done before"" ""The newly found power lay in her longing to see the little face again,"" she said. ""It grew like magic under her loving hands,"" she added. ""Every tender memory, sweet thought, and devout hope she had ever cherished, seemed to lend their aid"" ""It was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen,"" said Sy, ""and I will never forget it."". ""She broke her head and went home to come no more,"" was Giovanni's somewhat startling answer when Paul asked about Psyche. But when it was done and welcomed with tears and smiles, and praise more precious than any the world could give, then Psyche said within herself, like one who saw light at last, ""He was right"" ""If one is good, one is happy, and if happy, one can work well,"" she said. ""Doing one's duty is the way to feed heart, soul, and imagination"" ""I like that! If there is any power in her, she has taken the right way to find it out, I suspect,"" said Giovanni. ""If you want to know the truth, ask Psyche"". Adam was finished at last, proved a genuine success, and Paul heartily enjoyed the well-earned reward for years of honest work. He detected in the girl's face something better than beauty, though each time he saw it, it looked older and more thoughtful, often anxious and sad. At the feet of his Adam lay a handful of wild violets, with the dew still on them, and he gave it one loving look, and then forgot it. He gave it a friendliness as grateful to Psyche as his wise reticence. He was quite alone with the stately figure that shone white against the purple draperies and seemed to offer him a voiceless welcome from its marble lips.. ""I'll take the violets as a sign that I may go and ask her what."" ""She has been here and found my work good"" ""She must have accomplished something in that time"" ""It is just a year since she went home; she must have done something in her time here"" ""I'll go and find out what it is."" ""I will ask her if she has anything to say to me"" ""If she has something to tell me, I'll go to her and find her."" ""If not, then I'll ask you to go and get it for me."" ""It will be a pleasure to see you again"" ""You will always have my love and my company"". The little book was a pocket-diary. No name appeared on the fly-leaf, and, turning the pages to find some clue to its owner, he read here and there enough to give him glimpses into an innocent and earnest heart which seemed to be learning some hard lesson patiently. Only near the end did he find the clue in words of his own, spoken long ago, and a name, and he found it in his own words. The book was written by a man named  James, and was found by a. ""She lives there,"" he said, with as much certainty as if the pansies by the door-stone spelt her name, and, knocking, he asked for Psyche. Then, though longing intensely to know more, he shut the little book and went on, showing by his altered face that the simple record of a girl's life had touched him deeply. ""She's gone to town, but I expect her home every minute. Ask the gentleman to walk in and wait, Katy,"""

The fat pigeons tripped through the mud with their little red boots as if in haste to get back to their cos. Lizzie was caught in the rain by a storm. She was trying to hide from a pretty girl who was laughing at her. Lizzie's story is told in a novel called ""The Little Red Riding Hood"" The book is published by Simon & Schuster at £16.99.

Lizzie rang the bell, and was told to wait in thehall while Miss Belle tried the hat on. She was no longer to be seen; and, with asigh of relief, LizzieRing the bell and was asked to wait. She waited in a smallwaiting-room opened from the hall, and in it stood many bloomingplants. One particularly captivating little rose won her heart, and made herlong for it with a longing that became a temptation too strong toresist. She broke the stem, and hid it in her pocket. Lizzies' story is published in a book, ""Lizzies Story,"" published by William Morrow, £7.99.. Lizzie followed to a handsome room, where a pretty girl stood beforea long mirror with the hat in her hand. Then, frightened at what she had done, shecrept back to her place in the hall, and sat there, burdened withremorse. ""Yes, miss,"" was all Lizzie could say; for SHE considered that hatt the loveliest thing a girl could possibly own. ""You had better ask your mamma about it, Miss Belle, before you giveany orders,"" said the young lady, in a dissatisfied tone, as she twirled the hat. ""I suppose I must; but I WON'T have roses,"" answered Belle, crossly. She will be up in a few moments, and the girl can wait,""put in a maid, who was sewing in the ante-room. Then she glanced at Lizzie, and said more gently, ""You look verycold; come and sit by the fire while you wait."". Lizzie, a little girl, was very poor, and had no family. Belle offered to buy her some warmer clothes. Lizzie was delighted at the offer, and said she would love them. Belle asked Lizzies' family, but she said she had no one to take care of her. The girl was taken in by the family, and was taken to a home for the poor. Lizzy's mother was a kind woman, but had no children of her own. She was very sad, and told Belle that she was very lonely.. Belle said nothing, but sat among the sofa cushions, where she hadthrown herself, looking soberly at this other girl, no older thanshe was, who took care of herself and was all alone in the world. She often saw beggars and pitied them, but knew verylittle about their wants and lives. So it was like turning a newpage in her happy life to be brought so near to poverty as thischance meeting with the milliner's girl. ""Aren't you afraid and lonely and unhappy?"" she said, slowly,trying to understand and put herself in Lizzie's place.. ""What is your wish?"" asked Belle, hoping mamma wouldn't come justyet. ""To have a nice little room, and make flowers, like a French girl Iknow,"" said Lizzie. ""I can't help it, and may be things will getbetter by and by, and I'll have my wish,"" answered Lizzies, morehopefully, because Belle's pity warmed her heart and made hertroubles seem lighter. ""What do you want?"" asked the stranger. ""My wish is to be able to make flowers like aFrench girl,"" said the girl. ""And I can't get any for myself, and so I can's do mymake-believe ones. Lizzie had poured out her trouble rapidly; and the little story wasquite affecting when one saw the tears on her cheeks, the poorclothes, and the thin hands that held the stolen rose. Belle wasmuch touched, and, in her impetuous way, set about mending mattersas fast as possible.. Lizzie was in a blissful sort of waking-dream. Belle flew about the room a minute; thenvanished, leaving Lizzie to her comfortable task. When Belle came back with a handful of roses, she found LizzIEabsorbing in admiring contemplation of her new boots, as she atesponge-cake in a Blissful Sort of Dream.. ""Oh, miss, they're just lovely! I'll copy that pink rose as soon asever I can, and when I've learned how to do 'em tip-top, I'd like tobring you some, if you don't mind,"" answered Lizzie. ""I'd like it very much, for I should think you'd have to be veryclever to make such pretty things,"" said Belle. ""Put an orange in your pocket, and the flowers in water assoon as you can, so they'll be fresh when you want them. Good-by. Bring home our hats every time and tell me how you get on."". Lizzie was on her way home when she dropped her posy in the gutter. The little errand girl fell down the steps and landed directly on Mrs Turretviile's head. She had to be rescued by her mother-in-law, who had to carry the posy back to the house. Lizzie's mother was not home at the time, and had to pick up the pos. ""I've saved my posies, anyway,"" sighed Lizzie, as she picked herselfup, bruised, wet, and faint with pain. Turretville's costly bonnet. ""Oh, my heart! won'tMadame scold when she sees that band-box. ""Oh, mamma, I am so relieved that the box has come at last! If ithad not, I do believe I should have died of disappointment,"" criedpretty Belle, five years later, on the morning before her eighteenthbirthday. ""Dear mammy, I know I shall like it; your taste is so good and youknow what suits me so well,"" she said. ""It would have been a serious disappointment, darling,"" said her mother. ""I had sotmy heart on your wearing my gift to-morrow night, and when the steamers kept coming in without my trunk from Paris, I was veryan. ""Mamma, it is too lovely I and you are very kind to do so much forme"" ""Make haste, Marie; I'm dying to see it,"" said Belle, dancing about the great trunk. ""I'm going to wear it to the ball,"" said Marie, ""and I'll be very proud of it"" ""I'll be the most beautiful girl in the world,"" said the little girl, ""when I'm older"" "". Marie's mother asked how she would thank her daughter for the dress. Mamma replied, ""By putting it right on to see if it fits, and when you wear it lookyour happiest, that I may be proud of my pretty daughter"" The dress was never worn by Marie, and the wreath was lost in the trunk of the house. Marie's mother searched for it for days, but could not find it. The dress is now in the possession of Marie's sister, Belle.. The dress fitted to a charm, and was pronounced by all beholders theloveliest thing ever seen. Nothing was wanted but the wreath to makeit quite perfect, and when Marie returned, after a long search, withno forget-me-nots, Belle was in despair. ""Wear natural ones,"" suggested a sympathizing friend. Mariefell was desperate to find a wreath for her daughter's ball. She was about to give up in despair, when a Frenchwoman offered to make one for her. The Frenchwoman, Estelle Valnor, made a whole box of the loveliest forget-me-nots. Mariefell's daughter, Belle, was overjoyed at her find. She drove off, resolved to have her flowers whether there wereany or not. She returned to find the box on the table, full of the most beautiful flowers. She then went off to the ball, where she was also delighted.. The Frenchwoman, with a shrug, announced that it wasimpossible to give mademoiselle a single spray. All were engaged totrim a bridesmaid's dress, and must be sent away at once. Belle lost her temper entirely, for nopersuasion or bribes would win a spray from Estelle. As fast as possible, she told her tale anddemanded the flowers, no matter what the price might be. Neither would Estelle make herany, as her hands were full, and so small an order was not worthderanging one's self for. But observing Belle's sorrowful face, she said, affably. Belle took the card with thanks, and hurried away with a last hopefaintly stirring in her girlish heart. Somebody considered forget-me-nots the sweetest flowersin the world. Mamma knew this, and the kiss Belle gave her when thedress came had a more tender meaning than gratified vanity ordaughterly love. Here is her address.""                                                ""I'm so glad to see you,""  Belle said. ""I'll be in touch with you again soon."". ""I see the dear young lady who was so kind to me long ago. You don'tremember me, and never knew my name; but I never have forgotten youall these years"" ""Here ismy card."" ""I have none by me now, but I may be able to find you some."" ""Please send them to me as soon as possible"" ""Thank you very much"" ""I've been everywhere in vain"". ""I always hoped I could do something to show howgrateful I was, and now I can, for you shall have your flowers if Isit up all night to make them"" Lizzie went on to tell how Madame had dismissed her in a rage;how she lay ill till Mrs. Tifany came to see her. ""But you are so changed,"" began Belle, who did faintly recollectthat little incident in her happy life. ""Yes, I had a fall and hurt myself so that I shall always be lame."" ""Yes,"" said Lizzies, ""and I am so changed, too, that I. Lizzie tells how she suffered alone for a year in the hospital. She is now able to support herself by her delicate handiwork. ""I'm very happy now,"" says Lizzie, ""I get nearly workenough to pay my way"" ""I've learned to do it nicely, and it is so pleasantto sit here and make flowers instead of trudging about in the wet,"" she says. ""It is sopleasant to sit here instead oftrudging about,"" she adds, ""instead of trudging about inthe wet"". Lizzie said, ""I feel so idle and wicked when I see busypeople like you that I reproach myself for neglecting my duty and having more than my share of happiness"" Belle said: ""I'll come and take you to drive sometimes, for you are too pale,and you'll get ill sitting here at work day after day. Though I do sometimes wish I was able totrudge, one gets on so slowly with crutches"" Lizzie thanked her with a look, and then said, in a tone of interestthat was delightful to hear: ""Tell about. ""You are altogether too grateful for the little I have done,"" said Lizzie. ""It was the kind looks, the gentle words, the way it was done, and did me more good than a million ofmoney,"" said Belle. ""Don't be troubled if I don't send it tillevening,"" said the gardener. ""I can work fast, and this will be the happiest job I ever did,"" she said. ""You will have the flowers in time for your ball to-day night,"" said her friend. ""And I will be glad to see you again,"" she added. ""Oh, yes, I will,"" replied the gardner, ""I will be back in a day or two. Pretty Belle looked prettier than ever as she listened, and a brighttear stood in either eye like a drop of dew on a blue flower. I never stole a pin after that day, for the little rosewouldn't let me forget how you forgave me so sweetly. I sometimesthink it kept me from greater temptations, for I was a poor, forlornchild, with no one to keep me good.. The next day was full of delightfully excitingevents. Belle was delighted to learn of Lizzie's engagement. But she was worried that the wreath would be ruined without the garland. The day went on and on, with no sign of the flower. Finally, the day of the wedding came and went without a wreath. But the day was finally complete. The wreath was ready.. Belle's desire to look beautiful that night in somebody's eyes had increased four-fold. She was about to adjust the pompon when the tap of a crutch came down the hall, and Lizzie hurried in,flushed and breathless, but smiling happily as she uncovered the box. A general ""Ah!"" of admiration arose as Belle, mamma, and Mariesurveyed the lovely wreath that lay before them; and when it wascarefully arranged on the bright head that was to wear it, Belleblushed with. ""I am so glad you like it. I did my very best and worked all night,but I had to beg one spray from Estelle, or, with all my haste, Icould not have finished in time,"" said Lizzie, refreshing her wearyeyes with a long, affectionate gaze at the pretty figure before her. ""Money alone can't pay you for this kindness;so tell me how I can best serve you,"" said Belle, leaning toward her.. Belle kept her word, even when she was in a happy home of her own. Out of the dead roses bloomed a friendship that brightened Lizzie's life. Long after the blue garland was faded Belleremembered the helpful little lesson that taught her to read the faces poverty touches with a pathetic eloquence, which says to thosewho look, ""Forget-me-not."" The story of the little girl who made a bridal garland is told in the book ""The Little Girl Who Made a Bridal Garland"" by Lizzies' mother, Liza, and is published by Harper's Bazaar."

The mother spun yarn when she was able, for she was often. Rosy was left all alone, with no mother, no home, and no money to buy clothes and dinners with. The people gave her a warm red cloak, and a basket with a little loaf and bottle of milk in it, and some pennies to buy more to eat. The Children in the Wood is a children's book about a young girl who travels through the woods. The story is about a girl who is lost in the woods, and finds her way back to her father.. Rosy was kind to everything she met, and all little creatures were friends to her. One day she saw a tiny fish on the bank, nearly dead for want of water. She took him up, and dropped him into the nice. Rosy found a field-mouse with a broken leg. She tied up the broken leg with a leaf of spearmint and a blade of grass. Then she carried her to the nest under the roots. ""Good little Rosy, I shall pay you for all this kindness some day,"" said the mouse. ""I'm afraid you are not big enough to do much,"" answered Rosy. ""Wait and see,"" called the mouse; and all the little ones squeaked, as if they said the same thing.. Rosy trudged on and on, till at last she came to the sea. No ships were there, and she had no money to hire one if there had been any. She sat on the shore, very tired and sad, and cried a few big tears as salt as. ""I've come to help you over the water,"" said the fish. ""How can you, when I want a ship, and some one to show me the way?"" ""I shall just call my friend the whale, and he will take you over better than a. ""I'll carry you wherever you like,"" said the whale. ""Rosy liked it, and looked down into the deep sea"" ""Mermaids brought her pearls and red coral to wear, sea-apples to eat, and at night sung her to sleep"". Rosy was lost in the desert. The mouse came to her aid. She asked the lion to help her cross. The lion said he'd rather eat her than help her. Rosy thanked the lion.. The mouse sang, in its shrill little voice, ""Mousie, Mousie"" A loud roar was heard, and a splendid yellow lion, with fiery eyes and a long mane, came bounding over the sand to meet them. ""What can I do for. ""If the mouse had not gnawed me out of the net I never should have come at her call,"" said the lion. ""You see, little people can conquer big ones, and make them gentle and friendly by kindness,"" answered the mouse. ""And if the good little creature had not helped me, I never could have crossed this desert,"". Rosy was hungry and tired, and wanted to find her father. She took the wrong road, and after climbing a long while found the path ended in rocks over which she could not go. Night was coming on, and it was so cold she was afraid she would freeze before morning. Hold me fast round the neck, or you may grow dizzy and get a fall,. ""Here we are.

A little gray mouse waved her tail about, and pointed with her tiny paw to show the moles where to dig. ""They work faster than we can, and better; but who sent them? Is this strange little girl a fairy?"" said the men.. Rosy was very happy, and went back to the hut, and had a lovely time telling her father all about her troubles and her travels. He cried when he heard that the poor mother was dead before she could have any of the good things the gold would buy.

Lennox hurried to the window, with an unusual expression of interest in his listless face. Kate shook her head, and stood. ""This page of 'Belle's Life' is rather amusing, so read away,"" said Lennox, glancing up the street, as if he awaited the appearance of the next edition with pleasure. ""There isn't much to tell; she is a nice, bright, energetic, warm-hearted dear; the pride of the Doctor's heart. ""She has seen you, though, at church and dawdling about town, and she called you 'Sir Charles Coldstream' on the spot. How does that suit?"" asked Kate, maliciously. ""Not bad, I rather like that, and Wish she'd call some day, and stir us up."". ""It strikes me that Miss Morgan has slightly infected you with her oddity as far as bluntness goes,"" said Kate. ""It's rather amusing to be abused when one is dying of ennui,"" replied Kate, sharply. ""Begging your pardon, my dove, but I am,"" replied the Duchess.. ""I promised to give you my enlivening society for a month, and a Lennox keeps his word, even at the cost of his life."" ""I wished to come, I pined to embrace you,"" cried her brother, imploringly. ""I don't blame you for the stupidity of this confounded place."" ""If I didn't know it was half affectation, I should be in despair, you are.

""I'll go and think over your very sensible advice,"" he replied. ""It's not that I don't like it, I just don't want to hear it,"" she added.. ""I was sure he had a heart, if one only knew how to get at it!"" Kate went to the window to behold the ""dear Harry"" going briskly down the street after a pair of scarlet stockings. A spark of anger kindled in her eyes as she watched him disappear. She still stood knitting her brows in deep thought, for a grand idea was dawning upon her.. Lennox was a young man who had been spoilt by the flattery, luxury, and gayety of foreign society. He did his best, but by the end of the first week ennui claimed him for its own. From perfect despair he was rescued by the scarlet stockings, which went tripping by one day as he stood at the window, planning some means of escape.. The girl's face was a happy, wholesome one, with all sorts of good little dimples in cheek and chin, sunshiny twinkles in the black eyes, and. ""Uncommonly pretty feet -- she walks well, which American girls seldom do -- all waddle or prance -- nice face, but the boots are French, and it does my heart good to see 'em"" ""She was a very pretty girl, and I was glad to see her."" ""She had a very bright face, and a very pleasant smile."" ""I was glad she was a pretty girl."" ""It was a pleasant day."". Lennox was one of the best tempered fellows in the world, but the ""peacocks"" did rather nettle him because there was some truth in the insinuation. Kate saw it all, but took no notice till the day of the little tiff above recorded. After that she was as soft as a summer sea, and by some clever stroke had Belle Morgan to tea. Lennox was a satirical little person, and soon ceased to deserve the name. A look, a word, a gesture from a pretty woman is often more eloquent and impressive than moral essays or semi-occasional twinges of conscience. He formed the wholesome habit of promenading. Lennox was a famous pedestrian, and a little proud of her powers. He overtook her one bitter cold day. She was walking him on at a pace which soon made his furs a burden. He said: ""After a winter in the south of France one don't find arctic weather like this. ""There! you look more like your real self now,"" he said. ""Not a doubt of it,"" she replied. ""I'm sure of it"" ""I've been through a lot,"" he replied.. Lennox helped Belle carry a basket of bottles, dishes, and tidy little rolls of all sorts. ""It's very heavy, mayn't I carry it for you?"" he asked, in an insinuating manner. ""No, thank you,"" was on Belle's lips, but observing that he was got up with unusual elegance to pay calls. Lennox was taken to the unsavory residence of Biddy O'Brien. He was given a pair of gloves and told not to be afraid. The house was a place of want and misery for the people of the town. Lennox was not a fan of the place, but was taken with the girl.. ""Judging from the row in there, I should infer that. Lennox's visit to the hospital was a success. The hospital was full of sick children. Lennox was one of nine children in the hospital. The children were all sick. The doctor said that Mr. O'Brien had quite a herd of little dears.. Lennox had seen much fashionable benevolence, and laughed at it even while he imitated it. But this was a new sort of thing entirely, and in spite of the dirt, the noise. ""The Lord love ye, darlin, for remimberin us when ivery one, barrin' the doctor, and the praste, turns the cowld shouldther in our throuble!"" said the Irishman. ""Now if you really want to help, just keep this child quiet while I. Lennox and Belle O'Briens are both sick and well. Lennox is taking a break from his work. Belle is enjoying herself. The pair are enjoying each other's company. They are both feeling better. The O'briens have been ill for a few days.. Lennox offered to pay for the nurse's room. Belle refused to take it, saying: ""One can't buy blessings, they must be earned or they are not worth having"" Lennox then offered to be her almoner. She accepted, and they went on their way together. The story of the O'Brien family is told in the novel ""The Little Soldier"". ""Now isn't she odd?"" whispered Kate to her brother, as Belle appeared at a little dance at Mrs. Plantagenet's in a high-necked dress, knitting away on an army-sock. He neither shrugged, drawled, nor sauntered now, but gave her. He found her in a recess out of the way of the rushing and romping, busy with her work, yet evidently glad to be amused. Go and ask her to dance, before she is engaged, he told her. ""She doesn't dance round dances you know."". Lennox was making socks, and towels, and a comfort-bag for his substitute. ""Don't laugh at it, sir, it is for the foot of the brave fellow who is going to fight for me and his country,"" he said. ""But father don't approve of that sort of exercise, so I console myself with. ""I only hope he'll have the right sort of courage and be a credit to me,"" said Lennox. ""There's a chance for heroes now, if there ever was. When do you join your regiment?"" she added abruptly. ""Why should I?"" he asked. ""Having reminded me that you are a 'strictly neutral' Englishman. Lennox proposed to take Kate to the city for a little gayety. Miss Morgan openly approved the plan, but secretly felt as if the town was about to be depopulated. She did not speak to him again till he stood in the hall waiting for Kate, then Belle came down in the charming little red hood, and going straight up to him with her hand out, a repentant look, and a friendly smile.. ""Three weeks ago Kate asked me to help her in a little plot, and I consented, for the fun of the thing. She wanted something to amuse and stir you up, and finding that my queer ways diverted you, she begged me to be neighborly and let you do what you liked. Belle didn't see him flush and frown as she made her confession. When she looked up he only said, half gratefully, half reproachfully, ""I'm a good deal the better for it, I dare say, and ought to be very thankful for your friendly exertions"" Lennox warbled his most melting lays con amore, watching, as he sung, for any sign of sentiment.. ""Good night, Belle,"" he said tenderly. ""I shall come again before I leave the country,"" she said. ""If you come in a uniform,"" he replied.. ""I thought I'd had some experience, but one never can understand these women,"" said the Doctor. ""Good-bye, Sir Charles,"" said Belle, with a wicked twinkle of the eye, which lasted till he closed the hall-door, growling irefully. ""You're dull, my dear, run up to town with me to-. ""Yes, I remember, it was all very nice, does he? I'd like to see him, but do you think we can both leave home at once? Some one might come you know, and I fancy it's going to snow"" ""I'll go, then; it will please her,"" said her father. ""I do need change. I began to tell you about the fellow last week,. Belle was in a war-like mood when she saw her young man. She was disappointed when her friend Kate was engaged. She devoted herself to the departing regiment. She waved her hat as zealously as if she had a dozen friends and lovers in the ranks below. She felt her heart beat high, her face glowed, her eyes filled. She had been given a new lease of life, and she could not wait to see her young boy.. Lennox was a soldier in the First World War. He was killed by a bomb in the Battle of the Bulge. His daughter, who had been with him, was left devastated. She cried and wept as he was taken away. She asked, ""Was it really he? Why wasn't I told? What does it all mean?"". ""I came home for the express purpose of enlisting, and only delayed a month on Kate's account. If I ever return, I will receive my bounty at your hands. Till then please comfort Kate, think as kindly as you can of 'Sir Charles,' and sometimes pray a little prayer for him"". ""You've sent him off with a broken heart to rush into danger and be shot, or get his"

The coquettish mule had small feet, a nicely trimmed tassel of a tail, perked-up ears, and seemed much given to little tosses of the head, affected skips and prances. I respected this style of mule; and, had I possessed a juicy cabbage, would have pressed it upon him with thanks for his excellent example. The moral mules were a stout and hard- working creature,always tugging.. The histrionic mule was a melodramatic quadruped, prone to startling humanity by erratic leaps and wild plunges. When the last breath seemed to have left his body, and ""doctors were in vain,"" a sudden resurrection took place. If ever a mule laughed with scornful triumph, that was the beast, as he leisurely rose, gave a comfortable shake, and, calmly regarding the excited crowd, seemed to say--""A hit! a decided hit! for the stupidest of animals has bamboozled. The pathetic mule was, perhaps, the most interesting of all. He always seemed to be the smallest, thinnest, weakest of the six. The postillion with big boots, long- tailed coat and heavy whip was sure to bestride this one, who struggled feebly along. The jovial mule took everything easily, from cudgeling to caressing. If there ever chanced to be an apple core, a stray turnip or wisp of hay in the gutter, this Mark Tapley wassure to find it, and none of his mates seemed begrudge him his bite.. Pigs also possessed attractions for me, never having had an opportunity of observing their graces of mind and manner. Stout, sedate-looking pigs hurried by each morning to their places of business. Genteel pigs, with an extra curl to their tails, promenaded in pairs, lunching here and there, like gentlemen of leisure. Tipsy pigs hiccoughed their version of ""We won't go home till morning"" from the gutter. delicate young pigs tripped daintily through the mud as if they plumed themselves upon their ankles.. Maternal pigs, with their interesting families, strolled by in the sun. Often the pink, baby-"

""Miss Dane, I'm in a quandary,"" began the Doctor, with that expression of countenance which says as plainly as words. ""I want to ask a favor, but I wish you'd save me the trouble."" ""Can I help you out of it?"" ""Faith! I don't like to propose it, but you certainly can, if you please."" ""Then give it a name, I beg."" ""The Reb"" The Reb was a drunken, rascally little captain somebody took the trouble to capture, but whom nobody wants to take the trouble of curing.. ""Of course I will, out of perversity, if not common charity,"" said the prisoner. ""I should rather like to show them, that, though I cannot quite love my enemies, I am willing to take care of them."" ""I'm on that ward, and will do my best for you in every way,"" replied the prisoner, ""and I will find you a good attendant"" ""Very good; I thought you'd go,"" said Mr. Johnson. ""And speaking of abolition reminds me that you can have a contraband for servant, if you like"" ""I'll go, then,"" said Mrs. Johnson, ""but only if you'll go with me."" ""Yes, I'll go,"" responded the prisoner; ""I won't be long."". ""These black boys are far more faithful and handy than some of the white scamps given me to serve, instead of being served by. But is this man well enough?"" ""Yes, for that sort of work, and I think you'll like him"" ""Will you have him?"" ""By all means,--for I'll stand to my guns on that point, as on the other"" ""Yes"" ""He must have been a handsome fellow before he got his face slashed; not much darker than myself."" ""He was in a bad way when he came in, but vowed he'd die in the street rather. ""As soon as Tom is laid out, Skinner moved, Haywood washed, Marble dressed, Charley rubbed, Downs taken up, Upham laid down, and the whole forty fed."" ""We both laughed, though the Doctor was on his way to the dead-house and I held a shroud on my lap. But in a hospital one learns that cheerfulness is one's salvation"" ""I had seen many contrabands, but never one so attractive as this"" ""When can you go up?"" ""Yes, I'm fine. When can you come up?""""Yes, come up."" ""I'm fine."" ""No, you're fine. I'm sorry."" ""Yes?"" ""No."" ""What's wrong?"" ""Nothing."" ""Nothing"" ""Nothing. The boy was five-and-twenty at least, strong-limbed and manly, and had the look of one who never had been cowed by abuse or worn with oppressive labor. He was more quadroon than mulatto, with Saxon features, Spanish complexion, color in lips and cheek, waving hair, and an eye full of the passionate melancholy which in such men always seems to utter a mute protest against the broken law that doomed them at their birth. He sat on his bed doing nothing; no book, no pipe, no pen or paper anywhere appeared, yet anything less indolent or listless than his attitude and expression I never saw. Erect he sat, with a hand on either knee, and eyes fixed on the bare wall opposite, so rapt in some absorbing thought.. The man seemed to see an all-absorbing fact or fancy recorded on the wall, which was a blank to me. I wondered if it were some deep wrong or sorrow, kept alive by memory and impotent regret. I wanted to know and comfort him; and, following the impulse of the moment, I went in and touched him on the shoulder. In an instant the man vanished and the slave appeared. The boy cursed and raved, I rustled to and fro, steps passed the door, bells rang, and the steady rumble of army-wagons came up from the street. Still he never stirred. What could he be thinking of? The sick boy cursed, raved. The slave appeared and the boy said, ""I am sick, I am sick. I am going to die."". The manhood seemed to die out of him, and the comeliness that first attracted me died with him. As he turned, I saw the ghastly wound that had laid open cheek and forehead. Being partly healed, it was no longer bandaged, but held together with strips of that transparent plaster. Part of his black hair had been shorn away, and one eye was nearly closed; pain so distorted, and a cruel sabre-cut so marred that portion of his face. I felt as if a fine medal had been suddenly reversed, showing me a far more striking type of human suffering and wrong than Michel Angelo's bronze prisoner. I never see it without a shiver and swift recollections of the scenes with which it is associated in my mind.. ""Will you open these windows? this man needs more air"" ""Thank you, Sir,"" he replied. ""Perhaps it was fancy, but I thought that in the look of mingled surprise and something like reproach which he gave me there was also a trace of grateful pleasure,"" she said. ""I thought that there was a trace in grateful pleasure"" ""I went in to offer comfort as a friend, I merely gave an order as a mistress"". ""I a'n't a white man, Ma'am, I'm a contraband,"" he said. ""A contraband is a free man, and I heartily congratulate you,"" she replied. ""Have you had the fever?"" he asked. ""They should have thought of that when they put him here,"" she answered. ""Wounds and fevers should not be together,"" she said. 'I'm sorry,' he said, ""but I. ""It don't matter, Ma'am. I'd rather be up here with the fever than down with those niggers,"" he said. ""I would far rather have you than my lazy Jack,"" said the doctor. ""You shall stay, then,"" said his wife. ""But I'll try to get you moved."" ""No,"" he replied. ""There a'n't no other place fer me."" ""I'll try,"" she said. 'I'll get you a bed in the other room.' ""No. I'll get a bed for you in the next room,"" she replied.. ""I guess I'll do, Ma'am,"" he said. ""What is your other name?"" I asked. ""Bob,"" he replied. ""I should have found it as easy to call the chaplain ""Gus"" as my tragical-looking contraband by a title so strongly associated with the tail of a kite,"" he added. ""But are you well and strong enough?"" ""Yes, I think you will,"" he answered. ""By what name shall I call you?"" ""Ma'am"" ""Bob"" ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend. ""I like to call my attendants by their last names rather than by their first,"" he said. ""I've got no other, Ma'am; we have our master's names, or do without"" ""Well, I'll call you Robert, then, and you may fill this pitcher for me, if you will be so kind"" ""I was a prisoner all day, often all night, by the bedside of the Rebel,"" he wrote. ""He went; but, through all the tame obedience years of servitude had taught him, I could see that the proud spirit his father gave. The fever burned itself rapidly away, for there seemed little vitality to feed it in the feeble frame of this old young man. The captain was a gentleman in the world's eye, but the contraband was the gentleman in mine;--I was a fanatic, and that accounts for such depravity of taste, I hope. I never asked Robert of himself, feeling that somewhere there was a spot still too sore to bear the lightest touch; but, from his language, manner, and intelligence, I inferred that his color had procured for him the few advantages within the reach of a quick-witted, kindly treated slave. Silent, grave, and thoughtful, but most serviceable, was my contraband. I was glad of the books I brought him, faithful in the performance of the duties I assigned to him, grateful for. ""Give him water as long as he can drink, and if he drops into a natural sleep, it may save him"" ""I longed to ask what purpose was so visibly altering his aspect with such deepening gloom. But no one else had either time or desire to pry into the past of this branch of the family"" ""Nothing but sleep or a miracle will keep him now. Good night. I'll see you in the morning"" ""Good night. Goodnight. I love you."" ""I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."" ""Goodnight. Goodbye."" ""You've got to go now."" ""It's time to go."" ""Go!"" ""I'll be back"" ""In the morning, I'll be with you"". Robert was stretched on his bed in the inner room, the door of which stood ajar. Doctor Franck had offered to send him on to safer quarters, but he had said, ""No, thank yer, Sir, not yet"" The captain lay with his hot, haggard face turned toward me, filling the air with his poisonous breath. He feebly muttering, with lips and tongue so parched that the sanest speech would have been difficult to understand. I could just see a long, dark figure, with the lighter outline of a face. I fell to thinking of this curious contraband, who evidently prized his freedom highly, yet seemed in no haste to. ""Lucy!"" a choked voice called. ""Yes, here's Lucy,"" I answered, hoping that by the following fancy I might quiet him. His face was damp with the clammy moisture, and his frame shaken with the nervous tremor that so often precedes death. ""Lucy,"" he said. ""I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."" ""Yes,"" I replied. ""You are, of course."". ""That's a lie! she's dead,--and so's Bob, damn him!"" he said. ""I swore I'd whip the Devil out of her, and I did; but you know before she cut her throat she said she'd haunt me, and there she is!"" He pointed behind me with an aspect of such pale dismay, that I involuntarily glanced over my shoulder and started. I saw a shadowy face, with dark hair all about it, and a glimpse of scarlet at the throat. ""She used to sing that way to Bob, but she never would to me,"" he said, whispering like one in mortal fear. ""See gentle patience smile on pain,"" he added.. ""Lord, no, Ma'am; they all own half a dozen Bobs: but hearin' my name woke me; that's all."" He spoke quite naturally, and lay down again. I returned to my charge, thinking that this paroxysm was probably his last. But by another hour I perceived a hopeful change, for the tremor had subsided, the cold dew was gone, his breathing was more regular, and Sleep, the healer, had descended to save or take him gently away. ""Do you know him, Robert? Does he mean you?"" I asked him. ""Yes, I do,"" he replied. ""I'm Robert."". Doctor Franck bade me keep all cool and quiet, and not fail to administer a certain draught as soon as the captain woke. I laid my head on my arms, uncomfortably folded on the little table, and fancied I was about to perform one of the feats which practice renders possible. The striking of a deep-voiced clock woke me with a start. Having roused half a dozen times in an hour to find all quiet, I dropped my heavy head on his arms, and, drowsily resolving to look up again in fifteen minutes, fell fast asleep. The experiment was a failure, for previous vigils, confinement, and much care had rendered naps a dangerous indulgence. ""That is one,"" thought I, but, to my dismay, two more strokes followed. In remorseful haste I sprang up to see what harm my long oblivion had done. It was Robert. The instant my eye met his my heart began to beat. All along my nerves tingled that electric flash which foretells a danger that we cannot see. But his touch was steady, his voice quiet, as he said,--""Sit still, Ma'am; I won't hurt yer, nor even scare yer""""Let me go, Robert,--the captain is stirring,--I must give him something."". ""Has he taken it?"" I asked, more and more bewildered. ""I flung it out o'winder, Ma'am; he'll have to do without."" ""But why, Robert? why did you do it?"" ""Because I hate him!"" he replied. ""Impossible to doubt the truth of that"" ""I could only hold my breath and stare blankly at him"". ""Don't yer be frightened, Ma'am; don't try to run away, fer the door's locked an' the key in my pocket,"" Robert said. ""Don't cry out, fer yer'd have to scream a long while, with my hand on yer mouth, before yer was heard"" ""Lord help us! he has taken the fever in some sudden, violent way, and is out of his head. I must humor him till someone comes""; in pursuance of which swift determination, I tried to say, quite composedly, ""I will be still and hear you"". ""I'm sorry I can't do it, Ma'am; but yer'd jump out, or call, if I did, an' I'm not ready yet. Why did you shut it?"" ""I shut it to make yer sleep, an't heat would do it quicker 'n anything else I could do"" ""Do let me go to him! he'll die without care!"" ""I mean he shall;--don't yer interfere, if yer please"" ""I saw murder in his eyes, and turned faint with fear,"" said the captain. ""It is base to hurt a helpless man"". ""Robert, tell me what it means? Do not commit a crime and make me accessory to it."" ""There is a better way of righting wrong than by violence;--let me help you find it"" ""I will tell you, Ma'am; but mind, this makes no difference; the boy is mine"" ""Why do you hate him? He is not your master?"" ""He's my brother."" ""What do you mean by that?"" ""I mean that he is my brother"" ""What does that mean?"" ""That he is your brother?"" ""Yes, that's what it is."". ""Oh, no! remember, he is your brother."" ""I'll give the Lord a chance to take him fust; if He don't, I shall"" ""I'm not like to forget that, Ma'am, when I've been thinkin' of it all this week"" ""If you want me to go, I'll go."". ""Who is Lucy"" I asked hurriedly, intent on keeping his mind busy with any thought but murder. Robert's deep eyes filled, the clenched hands were spread before his face, and all I heard were the broken words, ""My wife,--he took her"" In that instant every thought of fear was swallowed up in burning indignation for the wrong, and a perfect passion of pity for the desperate man. He was no longer slave or contraband, no drop of black blood marred him in my sight, but an infinite compassion yearned to save, to help, to comfort him.. ""Yer see, Ma'am, his father,-- I might say ours, if I warn't ashamed of both of 'em,-- that's him here, eighteen then. He always hated me, I looked so like old Marster: he don't,--only the light skin an' hair"" ""I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,"" he said. ""I don't know what to say. I'm sorry. I don't understand."" ""I know what you mean,"" he replied. ""It's just that I'm not used to it. I can't understand it."" ""You're not the only one,"" he told him. ""He's the only person who. ""Old Marster was kind to all of us, me 'specially, an' bought Lucy off the next plantation down there in South Car'lina, when he found I liked her"" ""I married her, all I could,. ""Oh! what did you do?"" I cried, hot with helpless pain and passion. ""I half murdered him, an' to-night I'll finish,"" he replied. ""Yes, yes,--but go on now; what came next?"" ""They whipped me till I couldn't stand,"" he said. ""Then they sold me further South"" ""I'm not ashamed of what I did,"" he added. ""It was my duty to do it."" ""It's my life's duty to tell the truth,"" he concluded. ""What I've done is not my fault, it's my duty."". ""But, Robert, why think her dead? The captain was wandering when he said those sad things; perhaps he will retract them when he is sane. Don't despair; don't give up yet."" ""No, Ma'am, I guess he's right; she was too proud to bear that long. It's like her to kill herself. I told her to, if there was no other way"" ""I've never seen her since, an' now I never shall in this world,--maybe not in t'other."" ""Yer thought I was a white man once;--look here!"" ""That's all, Ma',. The captain's brother held his brother's life suspended in his hand, wavering between a dim hope and a deadly hate. ""I'm lettin' him go too easy; there's no pain in this; we a'n't even yet. I wish he knew me. My poor girl! Oh, it warnt' right! No, by God, it warn't!"" The captain put his hand on the brother's throat, and, watching the white face before him, muttered low between his teeth, ""Where's Lucy?"" The captain then put his hands on the boy's throat and said, ""I'll never forget. ""I must prevent murder, if I could,--but how? What could I do up there alone, locked in with a dying man and a lunatic?--for any mind yielded utterly to any unrighteous impulse is mad while the impulse rules it?"" ""Some good angel prompted me to use the one name that had power to arrest my hearer's hand and touch his heart"" ""I heartily believed that Lucy lived, and this earnest faith roused in him a like belief. What I said Heaven only knows, but surely Heaven helped me."" ""I was a woman's best defense; and sympathy, stronger than fear, gave me power to use it"" ""If you want to know the truth about Lucy, you can talk to her,"" he says.. ""Life had few joys for him; the world offered him no honors, no success, no home, no love"" ""How many white men, with all New England's freedom, culture, Christianity, would not have felt has he felt then?"" ""Should I have reproached him for a human anguish, a human longing for redress, all now left him from the ruin of his few poor hopes?"" ""Who had taught him that self-control, self-sacrifice, are attributes that make men masters of the earth and lift them nearer heaven? Should I have urged the beauty of forgiveness,. ""I should have warned him of penalties, of judgments, and the potency of law,"" he writes. ""What did he know of justice, or the mercy that should temper that stern virtue, when every law, human and divine, had been broken on his hearthstone?"" "" instinct, subtler than reason, showed me the one safe clue by which to lead this troubled soul from the labyrinth in which it groped and nearly fell,"" he says. ""I was not calm enough to try them. I was not; but. ""As surely as there is a Lord, you will find her here or in the beautiful hereafter, where there is no black or white, no master and no slave,"" he said. He took his hand from his brother's throat, lifted his eyes from my face to the wintry sky beyond, as if searching for that blessed country, happier even that the happy North. Alas, it was the darkest hour before the dawn--there was no star above, no light below but the pale glimmer of the lamp that showed. ""I want you to go away from here, from the temptation of this place, and the sad thoughts that haunt it,"" he says. ""You have conquered yourself once, and I honor you for it, because the harder the battle, the more glorious the victory,"" he adds. ""But it is safer to put a greater distance between you and this man,"" he continues. ""I have listened to you, Robert; now hear me, and heed what I say, because my heart is full of pity for you, full of hope for your future, and a desire to help you now"" ""Where is God?"" he asks. ""Where does God exist?"". ""Yes, Ma'am, I will."" ""Good! Now you are the man I thought you, and I'll work for you with all my heart"" ""I will write you letters, give you money, and send you to good old Massachusetts to begin your new life a freeman,--yes, and a happy man"" ""When the captain is himself again, I'll learn where Lucy is, and move heaven and earth to find and give her back to you"" ""Yes, Robert, for Lucy's sake."" ""I'll care for him. No, don't look there; I'll Care for him."" ""Come, Robert. Come, Robert"". ""I slipped the bolt across his door, and unlocked my own, flung up the window, steadied myself with a breath of air, then rushed to Doctor Franck. He came; and till dawn we worked together, saving one brother's life, and taking earnest thought how best to secure the other's liberty. When the sun came up as blithely as if it shone only upon happy homes, the Doctor went to Robert. For an hour I heard the murmur of their voices; once I caught the sound of heavy sobs, and for a time reverent hush, as if in the silence that good man were ministering to soul as well as sense. When he departed he took Robert with him, pausing to tell me he should get him off as soon as possible, but not before we met again.. ""I tried to rest, but could not, with the thought of poor Lucy tugging at my heart,"" says Robert. ""Just as night fell there came a tap, and, opening, I saw Robert literally ""clothed and in his right mind"" The Doctor had replaced the ragged suit with tidy garments, and no trace of that tempestuous night remained. He did not cross the threshold, did not offer me his hand,--only took"
0.43,0.53,33.58467495414714,"Lily was fond of throwing stones at the turtles on the rocks. She was also fond of her red sun-umbrella. She carried it with her when she went out in a gale of wind. The wind nearly took the umbrella out of her hand. She always wanted to go up in a balloon. She loved to throw stones at them. She also loved to play with them.. Lily fell down, down, till she went crash into a tree which grew in such a curious place that she forgot her fright. The tree looked as if made of glass or colored sugar; for she could see through the red cherries, the green leaves, and the brown branches. An agreeable smell met her nose; and she said at once, as any child would, ""I smell candy!"". Lily discovered that the snow under her feet was white sugar. The rocks were lumps of chocolate, the flowers of all colors and tastes. Little white houses soon appeared; and here lived the dainty candy-people. Bits of babies rocked in open-work cradles, and sugar boys and girls played with sugar toys in the most natural way.. Lily listened, and in a moment she understood what the song said. Carriages rolled along the jujube streets, drawn by the red and yellow barley horses we all love so well. cows fed in the green fields, and sugar birds sang in the trees. Lily ran up the chocolate steps into the pretty rooms, where all the. Lily was quite happy, going about tasting so many different kinds of sweeties. The babies were made of plain sugar, but the grown people had different flavors. The young ladies were flavored with violet, rose, and orange. The gentlemen were apt to have cordials of some sort inside of them, as she found when she ate one now and then slyly, and got her tongue bitten by the hot, strong taste as a punishment.. Lily discovered that it never rained, but snowed white sugar. Ginger was called to her more than once when so much candy made her teeth ache. They played football with big bull's-eyes, sailed in sugar boats on lakes of syrup, fished in rivers of molasses, and rode the barley horses all over the country.. The people all lived on sugar, and never quarrelled. If any got broken, they just stuck the parts together and were all right again. The way they grew old was to get thinner and thinner till there was danger of their vanishing. The feasts were delicious; and everybody went in their best clothes, and danced at the ball till they got so warm half-a-dozen would stick together and have to be taken to the ice-cream room to cool off.. Lily was a sweet child, and loved to eat all the sweet stuff in the country. She would eat the sweet babies and break up the old people. She even tried to poke the moon out of the sky in a pet one day. But when she had eaten so much candy, she began to get cross. She asked the gingerbread man, ""Where do you come from?"" He said he had been blown into the Candy country, and had been there a long time.. ""You'll get on better here with us Brownies than with the lazy Bonbons, who never work and are all for show,"" said the gingerbread man. ""Sit down. I shall be at leisure as soon as this batch is baked,"" he said. ""I know you will. Come on! I can talk while I work."". ""Bless me! that is the queerest thing I've heard yet. There are still some wise people down below who like gingerbread, and I have my hands full"" ""I'm tired of sweets myself, and long for a good piece of bread, though I used to want cake and candy at home"" ""Ah, my dear, you'll learn a good deal here."" ""You are lucky not to have got into the clutches of Giant Dyspepsia"". ""I leave my ginger behind when I go, and get white and round and beautiful, as you will see. The Gingerbread family have never been as foolish as some of the other cakes. Wedding is the worst; such extravagance in the way of wine and spice and fruit I never saw, and such a mess to eat when it's done! I don't wonder people get sick; serves 'em right."". ""It was a very busy place; for every one cooked all the time, and never failed and never seemed tired"" ""The earth was brown sugar or ground spice; and the only fruits were raisins, dried currants, citron, and lemon peel. Lakes of eggs all beaten up, and hot springs of saleratus foamed here and there ready for. ""Stand away while I pitch 'em down,"" said Snap, stopping at last before a hole in the ground where a dumbwaiter hung ready, with a name over it. Lily was amazed when she read ""Weber,"" ""Copeland,"" ""Dooling,"" and others, which she knew very. Lily was so surprised she sat down on a warm queen's cake that happened to be near, and watched Snap send down load after load of gingerbread to be eaten by children. ""Dear me! it seems as if I was there,"" said Lily, longing to hop down, but afraid of the bump at the other end. ""I'm done. Come along, I'll ride you back,"" called Snap.. ""Better wait till you get to Bread-land, and learn to make that. It looks great fun, and mamma wants me to learn,"" said Lily. ""I'll teach you that in a jiffy, if the. ""I never know when I've done my task till I'm called by the chimes and go to get my soul,"" said Snap, turning his currant eyes anxiously to the clock. Lily fell to work with all her might, after Snap had put on her a paper apron and a cap like his.. ""Ha, ha! I'm free!"" cried Snap, catching up the silver-covered square that seemed to fall from heaven. He ran to a great white sea of flour, holding the yeast-cake clasped to his breast as if his life depended on it. The other cake-folk stood round the shore with her; for it was a great event, and all were glad that the dear fellow was promoted so soon.. ""He's gone to the happy land, and we shall miss him,"" said a gentle Sponge cake. Lily hurried after Snap, eager to see the new country, which was the best of all. A delicious odor of fresh bread blew up from the valley as she stood on the hill-top. A river of milk flowed through the peaceful land. Fountains of yeast rose and fell with a pleasant foam and fizz.. Lily was delighted to find a beautiful, homelike landscape. The ground was a mixture of many meals, and the paths were golden Indian. Buckwheat flowers bloomed on their rosy stems, and tall corn-stalks rustled their leaves in the warm air that came from the ovens hidden in the hills.. Johnny Cake, Sally Lunn and Lily ran off in a race. They stopped, panting, and sat down on some very soft rolls to rest. ""We farm, we study, we bake, we brew, and are as merry as grigs all day long,"" said Sally. ""Our schools are not like yours; we only study two things,--grain and yeast"". Lily never liked to go to school, but she was ashamed to own it. So she went along with Sally, and was so amused with all she saw that she was glad she came. The teacher was a pleasant, plump lady from Vienna, very wise, and so famous for her good bread that was a Professor of Grainology. She began with the wheat ear, and told them all about it in such an interesting way that Lily felt as if she had never known anything about the bread she ate before. The children were very bright; for they were given the best kinds of oatmeal and Graham bread, with very little white bread or hot cakes to spoil their young stomachs. They were very lively, and seemed as bright and gay as if acidity, heaviness, and mould were quite unknown to them. The children were taught how to use the yeast, and how it would work till it blew the cork out.. Lily went to the bakehouse and found her old friend Muffin hard at work making Parker House rolls. ""Well, isn't this better than Candy-land or Saccharissa?"" he asked, as he rolled and folded his bits of dough with a dab of butter tucked inside. ""Ever so much!"" cried Lily. ""I feel better already, and mean to learn all I can"". Muffin was a loaf of bread. He was eaten by a good human being, and became a part of him or her. ""Isn't that a noble way to live, and an end worth working for?"" asked Muffin, in a tone that made Lily feel as if some sort of fine yeast had got into her, and was setting her brain to work.. Lily made the perfect loaf, and wanted to go home, that her mother might see and taste it. She stayed in Bread-land a long time, and enjoyed and learned a great deal that she never forgot. ""I'd love to think I had given her strength or pleasure by my work,"" she said, as she and Sally stood looking at the handsome loaf.. ""Where is Muffin? I can't go without seeing him, my dear old friend,"" said Lily. ""He is here,"" said Sally, touching the loaf. ""Don't forget what you have learned, and you will always be glad you came to us"" ""How kind of him! I must be careful to grow wise and excellent, else he will be disappointed and have died in vain"". She ate very little cake and candy, except at Christmas time, when the oldest and"
0.42,0.52,26.183023384275455,"A gloomy-faced young man with despair in his heart strode up the stairs to his poor home. He flung wide the door and was about to enter, but paused upon the threshold. A glance told him that he had unconsciously passed his own apartment and come up higher, till he found himself in a room poorer but more cheerful than his own. A little voice and wan face of a child lay upon a bed placed where the warmest sun. ""Why do you lie there? are you sick?"" asked the intruder. ""No, I am not sick, though I shall never leave my bed again,"". ""How long have you lain here, my poor boy?"" asked the stranger, touched and interested in spite of himself. ""Three years, sir."" ""And yet you are happy! What in Heaven's name have you to render you contented. ""What have you to make you happy, Jamie? Tell me your secret,"" he asked. ""I need the knowledge very much,"" he replied. ""First of all I have dear Bess,"" he said. ""She gives me flowers and birds, and all the sunshine"". ""I have my bird, and my roses, I have books, and best of all I have the cross on the old church tower. I can see it from my pillow and it shines there all day long, so bright and beautiful, while the white doves coo upon the roof below. I love it dearly."" ""I have a good kind Bess, who waits on me all day; but when I wake at. The boy's face lit up eagerly as he said, ""Because it does me so much good, sir"" The city's din was far below, and through the summer air the faint coo of the doves and the flutter of their wings came down, like peaceful country sounds. ""I watch the sun climb up along the roofs in the morning, creeping higher and higher till it shines upon the cross and turns it into gold,"" he said.. ""But when there is no moon, or clouds hide it from you, what then, Jamie?"" asked the young man. ""I wait till it is clear again, and feel that it is there, although I cannot see it, sir"" ""I hope it never will be taken down, for the light upon the cross seems like that I see in dear Bessie's eyes when she holds me"". ""I'll try the world once more in a humbler spirit, and have faith in you, at least, my little Providence,"" said the young man. The young man went away, leaving the. ""I have seen it in your poor thin face and these old clothes,"" says Bess. ""I know you have, Walter; I have seen the pain in your face"" ""I have also seen the joy in his eyes, and the joy of his smile,"" says Walter, ""and I know that you have seen them too."" ""I've seen the love in your eyes and I've seen your joy in your smile,"" adds. ""Hush, Jamie, and lie here upon my arm and rest; for you are very tired with your work,--I know by this hot hand and shortened breath. Are you easy now? Then listen; for I've brave news to tell you, and never say again I do too much for you,--the cause of my success"". ""Did I do so much?"" asked the boy with innocent wonder. ""I never knew it, and always thought you had grown happier and kinder because I had learned to love you more"" ""I wrote a story, Jamie,--a story of our lives, weaving in few fancies of my own and leaving you unchanged,"" Walter replied. ""No fictitious sorrows. I painted no fictitious joys"". ""I don't need much, you know, for I don't work like Bess; but yet she gives me all"" ""I am not very tired. Sleep, yourself, dear, and dream of pleasant things"" ""This book, unlike the others, was not rejected; for the simple truth, told by an earnest pen, touched and interested"" ""Bess bent closer to her work, trying. ""How can I bear to see her working so for me, and I lying idle here?"" he said. ""I am so poor,"" he added, ""I can't bear it"". Walter looked at the poor, and said to himself, ""They shall not suffer; I will beg or steal first"" He then passed on, saying sternly, ""I have nothing for vagrants"" He stopped to help a sick child and a starving woman, but only arrested an old man.. ""I'll take from the rich what the poor so freely give,"" says the beggar. ""I see no other way, and they must not starve,"" he adds. ""Go to work, young man."" ""I'll beg no more,"" he says, ""but I'll take what I can"". Walter thought of Jamie, and seemed to hear again the childish words, uttered long ago, ""God will remember us"" He averted his eyes, as if they had rested on the mild, reproachful countenance of a friend. The dark figure in the shadow never stirred, only stood there with bent head, accepting the silent rebuke.. The boy did not answer, but turned on his pillow and kissed his sister's shadow as it flitted by. ""But why ask me that with such a wistful face?"". Sister Bess sat in the silent room alone, working still, but pausing often to wipe away the tears that fell upon a letter on her knee. Walter entered with a beaming face, to show the first rich earnings of his pen, and ask her to rest from her long labor in the shelter of his love. Told him of the lover she left years ago to cling to Jamie, and how this lover. ""He writes so tenderly and bears his disappointment bravely for my sake,"" says Bess. ""It is very hard to see our happiness deferred again when such a little sum would give us to each other"" ""As she ceased, Bess looked for comfort into. ""I never knew of this before, Bess; you kept your secret well"" he said, trying to seem unchanged. ""I never spoke of it, for words could do no good, and Jamie grieved silently about it, and he thought it a great sacrifice, though I looked on it as a sacred duty"" ""My grateful little Jamie"" she said. ""Keep a good heart and rest assured that I will help you if I can"". ""It is nothing, Bess, another time will do as well,"" he answered, eager to be gone lest he should betray what must be kept most closely now. ""I have it in my power to make them happy,"" he mused as he sat alone, ""but I cannot do it, for in this separation lies my only hope"" He may die or may grow weary, and then to whom will Bess turn for comfort. ""I promised to be kind to Bess, and with God's help I will keep my vow"" ""It is so easy to perceive the right, so hard to do it"" ""I wish to Heaven I were asleep with you, freed from the temptations that beset me"" ""The beautiful example of the child rebuked the passion of the man"" ""He thought of that last night and saw now with clearer eyes the sacrifices and the trials silently borne for. Walter looked up at the shining cross, striving to see in it not merely an object of the dead boy's love, but a symbol of consolation, hope, and faith. ""This is the hardest struggle of my life, but I will conquer and come out from the conflict master of myself at least,"" he said. ""Like Jamie, try to wait until the sunshine comes again, even if it only shine upon me, dead like him."". ""I owe this all to Jamie,"" Walter said. ""I promised him I'd try to do"" ""I have truly, ""cleft his heart in twain and flung away the baser part"" ""The best use I can make of it is to secure your happiness,"" he said.. ""I shall work, Bess, and in that find content and consolation for the loss of you and Jamie,"" he said. ""Do not think of me; this money will do me far more good in your hands than my own. Take it and God bless you, Sister Bess."". Walter's pen had won for him an honored name. Poverty and care were no longer his companions. Many homes were open to him, many hearts would gladly welcome him. But he still lingered in the gloomy house, a serious, solitary man, for his heart lay beneath the daisies of a child's grave."
0.77,0.87,55.719139297848244,"John is going, ma'am, and wants to see you, if you can come. One of the earlier comers had often spoken of a friend, who had remained behind. It seemed a David and Jonathan sort of friendship. He came in a day or two after the others; and, one evening, when I entered my ""pathetic room,"" I found a lately emptied bed occupied by a large, fair man, with a fine face, and the serenest eyes I ever met. He said: ""The moment this boy is asleep; tell him so, and let me know if I am in. ""I had some curiosity to behold this piece of excellence, and when he came, watched him for a night or two, before I made friends with him"" ""He's an out an' out fine feller, ma'am; you see if he ain't,"" said his mate. ""He seldom spoke, uttered no complaint, asked no sympathy, but tranquilly observed what went on about him."" ""No picture of dying statesman or warrior was ever fuller of real dignity than this Virginia blacksmith"" ""A most attractive face he had, framed in brown hair and beard, comely featured and full of vigor, as yet unsubdued by pain"". John's mouth was grave and firm, with plenty of will and courage in its lines. His eyes were child's eyes, looking one fairly in the face with a clear, straightforward glance. He seemed to cling to life, as if it were rich in duties and delights. The only time I saw his composure disturbed was when my surgeon brought another to examine John. He scrutinized their faces with an anxious look, asking of the elder,--""Do you think I shall pull through, sir?"" ""I hope so, my man,"" he replied. ""I am sure you will,"" he said. ""It is the only hope I have for the future."" He died the next day. The next night, as I went my rounds with Dr. Dr.. ""Every breath he draws is like a stab,"" says the doctor. ""He possesses great vitality; but even his temperate life can't save him"" ""He won't last more than a day or two, at furthest,"" adds the doctor, ""but women have a way of doing such things comfortably"" ""I could have sat down on the spot and cried heartily, if I had not learned the wisdom of bottling up one's tears for leisure moments,"" says John. ""I wish it could,"" says his mother, ""that he could die."" ""He can find neither forgetfulness nor ease, because he must lie on his wounded back or suffocate"". Dr. P. says he could not give him up so soon, or think with any patience of so excellent a nature robbed of its fulfilment. The army needed men like John,--earnest, brave, and faithful; fighting for liberty and justice with both heart and hand, true soldiers of the Lord. It was an easy thing to say, ""Tell him he must die,"" but a cruelly hard thing to do, and by no means as ""comfortable"" as he politely suggested. I had not the heart to do it then, and privately indulged the hope that some change for the better might take place, in spite of gloomy prophecies, so, rendering my task unnecessary. A few minutes later, as I came in again with fresh rollers, I saw John sitting erect, with no one to support him,. The Doctor's words caused me to reproach myself with neglect. I had forgotten that the strong man might long for the gentler tendance of a woman's hands. John looked lonely and forsaken just then, as he sat with bent head, hands folded on his knee. I saw great tears roll down and drop upon the floor. It was a new sight there; for though I had seen many suffer, some swore, some groaned, most endured silently, but none wept. The Doctor said he had left John to him, thinking it might be more agreeable and safe; for both strength and experience were needed in his case. He said that he had never hitherto seen it done; for, having simpler wounds to. ""No one saw the tears fall but me,"" says the poet. ""I hovered about him, in a remorseful state of mind that would not let me rest, till I had bathed his face, brushed his ""bonny brown hair,"" set all things smooth about him"" ""He watched me with the satisfied expression I so linked to see,"" he says. ""When I offered the little nosegay, held it carefully in his great hand, smoothed a ruffled leaf or two, surveyed and smelt it with an air of genuine delight,"" he adds.. ""I felt him softly touch my gown, as if to assure himself that I was there"" ""He could not talk much, for breath was precious, and he spoke in whispers"" ""From occasional conversations, I gleaned scraps of private history which only added to the respect I felt for him"" ""I found this man as bashful as he was full of excellences and fine aspirations,"" he said, ""which, having no power to express themselves in words, seemed to have bloomed into his character and made him what he was"" ""The manliest man among my forty-five was the one who said, 'Yes, ma'am, I. John Lennon once asked his wife to write him a letter. She asked if it would be addressed to wife or mother. He said he would write to mother when he got better.. ""Did you think I was married because of this?"" he asked, touching a plain ring he wore, and often turned thoughtfully on his finger when he lay alone. ""Partly that, but more from a settled sort of look you have,--a look which young men seldom get until they marry."" ""I don't know that; but I'm not so very young, ma'am; thirty in May and have been what you might call settled this ten years"" ""How came you to go to war, if you felt so? Wasn't enlisting as bad as marrying?"" ""I went because I couldn't help it,"" he replied.. ""Do you ever regret that you came, when you lie here suffering so much?"" ""Never ma'am; I haven't helped a great deal, but I've shown I was willing to give my life, and perhaps I've got to."" ""I don't blame anybody, and if it was to do over again, I'd do it"" ""I didn't want the glory or the pay; I wanted the right thing done, and people kept saying the men who were in earnest ought to flight"" ""Mother saw the case, gave me her ring to keep me steady, and said. ""I'm a little sorry I wasn't wounded in front; it looks cowardly to be hit in the back, but I obeyed orders, and it doesn't matter in the end, I know"" ""This is my first battle; do they think it's going to be my last?"" ""I'm afraid they do, John,"" I replied. ""It's difficult to believe all at once"" ""I don't think I'm afraid, but it's hard to believe,"" he said. ""I know I'm not afraid,"" I said. 'I know that I am not afraid' ""I think I am afraid,"" he replied.. ""I knew you'd come! I guess I'm moving on, ma'am,"" John said. ""I hope the answer will come in time for me to see it,"" he added. ""Even while he spoke, over his face I saw the gray veil falling that no human hand can lift"" ""I had been summoned to many death-beds in my life, but to none that made my heart ache as it did then"" ""My mother called me to watch the departure of a spirit akin to this in its gentleness and patient strength."" ""I sat down by him, wiped the drops from his forehead, stirred the air about him with the slow wave of a fan, and waited to help him die"". ""He stood in sore need of help,--and I could do so little,"" says the author. ""The strong body rebelled against death, and fought every inch of the way"" ""His limbs grew cold, his face damp, his lips white, and, again and again, he tore the covering off his breast"" ""Yet through it all, his eyes never lost their perfect serenity,"" writes the author, ""and the man's soul seemed to sit therein, undaunted by the ills that vexed his flesh"" ""One by one the men woke, and round the room appeared a circle of pale faces and watchful eyes, full of awe and pity"". The last words of David's friends were a touching farewell. The kind soul was full of trouble, as the choke in his voice, the grasp of his hand betrayed. But there were no tears, and the farewell of the friends was the more touching for its brevity. Each man there had wondered at his patience, respected his piety, admired his fortitude, and now lamented his hard death; for the influence of an upright nature had made itself deeply felt, even in one little week. ""Take my things home, and tell them that I did my best,"" said David.. ""For God's sake, give me air!"" was the only cry pain or death had wrung from him. Dan flung up the window. The first red streak of dawn was warming the gray east, a herald of the coming sun. John saw it, and with the love of light which lingers in us to the end, seemed to read in it a sign of hope of help. Over his whole face there broke that mysterious expression, brighter than any smile, which often comes to eyes that look their last. ""I thought him nearly gone, and had just laid down the fan, believing its help to be no longer needed, when suddenly he rose up in his bed, and cried out with a bitter cry that broke the silence"". He laid himself gently down; and, stretching out his strong right arm, as if to grasp and bring the blessed air to his lips in a fuller flow, lapsed into a merciful unconsciousness. He died then; for, though the heavy breaths still tore their way up for a little longer, they were but the waves of an ebbing tide that beat unfelt against the wreck. He never spoke again, but to the end held my hand close,. John lay in state for half an hour, a thing which seldom happened in that busy place. A universal sentiment of reverence and affection seemed to fill the hearts of all who had known or heard of him. Many came to see him, and I felt a tender sort of pride in my lost patient. The lovely expression which so often beautifies dead faces soon replaced the marks of pain. I could not but be glad that, through its touch, the presence of human sympathy, perhaps, had lightened that hard hour. I longed for those who loved him best to see his when half anhour's acquaintance with Death had made them friends. I felt that he looked a most heroic figure, lying there stately and still as the statue of some young knight asleep upon his tomb.. John's letter had been forgotten the night before. I kissed this good son for her sake. I laid the letter in his hand, still folded as when I drew my own away. I left him, glad to have known so genuine a man, and carrying with me an enduring memory of the brave Virginia blacksmith, as he lay serenely waiting for the dawn of that long day which knows no night. The letter was returned to John, and he was happy to have it back. He would not be without some token of the love which makes life beautiful and outlives death. He was a brave man. He died in a lonely place in the ""Government Lot,"" but he was not alone."
0.84,0.94,65.66516151441473,"Five and twenty ladies, all in a row, sat on one side of the hall, looking very much as if they felt like the little old woman who fell asleep on the king's highway and awoke with abbreviated drapery. Five and twenty gentleman, all on the opposite side, looked somewhat subdued, as men are apt to do when they fancy they are in danger of making fools of themselves. They, also, were en costume, for all the dark ones had grown piratical in red shirts, the light ones nautical in blue; and a few boldly appeared in white. On the platform appeared a pile of dumb-bells, a regiment of clubs, and a pyramid of bean-bags, and stirring nervously among them a foreign-looking gentleman, the new leader of a class lately formed. Thor Turner, whose mission it was to strengthen the world's spine, and convert it to a belief in air and exercise, by setting it to balancing its poles and spinning merrily. His advent formed an epoch in the history of the town. It was a quiet old village, guiltless of bustle, fashion, or parade, where each man stood for what he was; and, being a sagacious set, every one's true value was pretty accurately known. A sensible, free-and-easy town, for the wisest man in it wore the worst boots, and no one thought the less of his understanding. The belle of the village went shopping with a big sun-bonnet and tin pail, andno one found her beauty lessened.. Dr. Turner's theories, being eminently so, were accepted at once and energetically carried out. Restless people were soothed by the lullaby the river sang in its slow journey to the sea. Old people found here a pleasant place to make ready to die in. Young people to survey the world from, before taking their first flight. strangers looked back upon it, as a quiet nook full of ancient legends.. August Bopp, the new leader of the class, was a German possessing but a small stock of English, though a fine gynmast. He found his carefully prepared sentences slipping away from his memory as the ice appears to do from under unhappy souls first mounted upon skates. An awful silence reigned; the class was reduced to a quivering mass of laughter and tears. The class was led by a young man called  ""Mr. Bopp,"" who had been a member of the club for some time. He was the only member who could speak English, and he was the leader of his class. The students were led by ""Mr.Bopp,"" a young German man, who was also a former club member.. Mr. Bopp was about to launch his first ""Ladees und gentlemen,"" when the door opened. A small, merry-faced figure appeared, looking quite at ease in the novel dress. Mr. Boopp righted himself, and burst out with a decided,-- ""The time have arrived that we shall begin"" He was greeted by a general glance of approbation from the gentlemen's side. A welcoming murmur ran along the ladies' side. Mr Bopp's first words were: ""Ladys und gentlemen: the time have arrive that we Shall begin"". ""Will the gentlemen serve the ladees to a wand, each one, then spread theirselves about the hall, and follow the motions I will make as I shall count."" ""Five minutes of chaos, then all fell into order, and nothing was heard but the leader's voice and the stir of many bodies moving simultaneously"" ""Bags flew in all directions, clubs hurtled through the air, and dumb-bells played a castinet accompaniment to peals of laughter that made better music than any band"" ""Old and young gave themselves up to the universal merriment, and, setting dignity aside, played like happy-hearted children for an hour"" ""Mr. Inches, four feet three, trotted away with Deacon Stone on his shoulder"". The sprightly young lady whose entrance had been so opportune seemed a universal favorite. She was overwhelmed with invitations to ""bag,"" ""hop,"" and ""blow"" from the gentlemen who hovered about her. Mr. Bopp thought the young lady must be training for a boat-race or the ring. He had never seen such a little piece of earnestness before, and began to think the girl was training for the ring or the boat. Mr Bopp was so impressed that he decided to write a book about it. He called it ""The. The Zouave's leader was a young woman. She was very fast and very agile. She hit out from the shoulder with a vigor that would have done execution. Mr. Bopp's courage rose as he watched her. He felt as if his muscles were made of India-rubber. His nerves of iron were of iron. He was determined to excel. He wanted to be the best. He had to be. He could not let go of his desire. He would have been the worst man in the world if he had not been determined to succeed.. Mr. Bopp was seen to grow very pale, and drop in a manner which it was evident his pupils were not expected to follow. The ladies successfully lessened their unusual bloom by staring wildly at one another and suggesting awful impossibilities. The bustle subsided, as suddenly as it arose; and Mr Bopp went into his work heart and soul, issuing commands like general at the head of his troops. He kept both interest and fun in full blast till people laughed who had not laughed heartily for years. When the clock struck ten, all were bubbling over with that innocent jollity which makes youth worth possessing, and its memory the sunshine of old age. He went on to perform a series of tricks, which were so successful that he was asked to do them again. The last exercise was drawing to a close, and a large ring of respectable members of society were violently sitting down and. Mr. Bopp, rather damp about the head and dizzy about the eye, but quite composed, appeared, saying, with the broken English and appealing manner which caused all the ladies to pronounce him ""a dear"" on the spot. ""I hope you will excoose me for making this lesson to be more short than it should,"" he said. ""Next week I shall be able to take time by the hair, so that I will not have so much engagements in one day,"" he added. After a round of applause, as a last vent for their spirits, the class dispersed, and Mr.Bopp was wrestling with a vicious pin as he put on his collar. ""A sure sign he has no ma to see to his buttons, poor lamb!"" thought Mrs. Fairbairn, watching him from afar.. Dick was a fine sample of young America in its best aspect, and would have said ""How are you?"" to Louis Napoleon if he had been at hand, and have done it so heartily that the great Frenchman would have found it hard to resist giving as frank an answer. Mr. Turner always stayed with us, and we promised to do the honors of the town to any gentleman he might send to supply his place. It's all settled, the sleigh's at the door, and here's your coat; so, come on!"" ""I'm a good man, and I'm glad to be with you,"" said the young man. ""I'll be glad to see you again,"" said his mother.. Mr. Bopp surrendered at once, and shook him into his coat with an amiable impetuosity which developed a sudden rent in the well-worn sleeve thereof. Dick opened his eyes, and was about opening his mouth also, for the exit of some blunderingly good-natured reply, when a warning poke from his sister restrained him. Dolly, with the innocent hypocrisy which is as natural to some women as the art of tying bows, said, as she led the way out,--""You see the worth of gymnastics, Dick, in this delightful indifference to cold"" ""Thank you; I haf no coat but one,"" said Mr.Bopp.. ""I sincerely hope we may reach a like enviable state of health, and look upon great-coats as effeminate, and mufflers a weakness of the flesh. Do you think we shall, Mr. Bopp?"" he asked. ""It is not choice, but what you call necessitee, with me,"" he replied. ""I truly hope you may never haf to exercise to keep life in you when you haf sold your coat to pay a doctor's bill, or teach the art of laughing while your heart is heavy as one stone"" ""Small things make much happiness for me, and a kind word is often better than a rix dollar,"" he said.. If August Bopp had been an Englishman, he would have felt much, but said less on that account. He would have tried to conceal his past grandeur, present importance, or future prospects. But being a German, he showed exactly what he was, with the childlike frankness of his race. A cheery-faced little woman, like an elder Dolly, in a widow's cap, stood on the threshold, with a friendly greeting for the stranger, which warmed him as no fine could have done. He was touched by the kind words, and put an extra blanket on his bed, while Dick tucked him up in buffalo robes. He said: 'I am so happy to be here, and I. The story of a young man who left his family to live on his own in the snow. The story of how he came to love and be loved by a woman he met in a snow-covered field. The man's story of his life with his sister, and his struggle to find his way back to her. The tale of his love for his sister and his desire to be with her. His love for her, and for her love for him. His desire to have a family. His struggle to be a man. His struggles to find a way to be happy. His journey to find himself. His death. His loss. His grief. His pain. His despair. His joy. His hope. His fear. His tears. His heart. His hopes. His dreams. His fears.. The Cupid of the present day was undoubtedly ""raised"" in Connecticut. The ingenuity and shrewdness of that small personage could have sprung from no other soil. The twins devoted themselves to their guest, each in a characteristic manner. Dick, as host, offered every article of the fire to a perpetual roar. Dolly made the stranger one of them at once by talking bad German, as an offset to his bad English, called him Professor in spite of all denials, and unconsciously symbolized his future bondage by giving him a tangled skein to hold for the furtherance of her mother's somewhat lengthened job.. The play was written by William Shakespeare in the early 1800s. It was set in London and was written for the first time in 1815. The play was first published in London in 1813. It is now being republished in. August Bopp was three and twenty, imaginative, grateful, and heart-whole. He was sitting opposite a blooming little damsel, with a head, bound by a pretty red snood. She bent down before him, and very close to his own a pair of distracting hands. Every finger of which had a hit to make, and made it. He felt himself entering upon a new and very agreeable experience. He wrote a book about it, and it was published in the United States. He also wrote a novel, and a play, called ""The Little God of Snares"". Professor Bopp's admiration ""grew by what it fed on,"" he fell into a chronic state of stammer and blush. It was a winning face, full of smooth curves, fresh colors, and sunshiny twinkles. If the King of Clubs saw a comely face, the Queen of Hearts saw what observing girls call a ""good face;"" and with a womanly respect for strength, the manliest attribute of man, she admired the broad shoulders and six feet one of her new master. The face was as changeful as an April day, and always pleasant, whether mischievous, mournful, or demure. The Professor felt like a very resigned fly in the web of a most enticing young spider. He was a man, not a man. He had a face.. The Professor had an eminent nose, a blonde beard, and a crop of ""bonny brown hair"" long enough to have been gathered into a ribbon. The silk was wound at last, the coat repaired. Dick with difficulty concealed the growing stiffness of his shoulders. Dolly turned up the lamp, which bluntly hinted bedtime, and Mrs. Ward successfully devoured six gapes behind her hand. But in the seventh, Bopp, who glanced at the clock, stopped in the middle of a sentence, and, with a hurried ""goot-night,"" made for the door without the least idea whither he was going.. Dick was installed in the ""best chamber,"" where his waking dreams were enlivened by a great fire, and his sleeping ones by an endless succession of skeins. Each rapturously concluded in the style of Sam Weller when folding carpets with the pretty maid. ""I tell you, Dolly, it won't do, and I'm not going to have it,"" he said. ""And it's a family failing, Dick,"" cut in Dolly. ""Not. ""What eloquence! But you'd never dare to try it on Mr. Bopp."" ""I shouldn't like to predict what would happen to you if you did."" ""If you say 'dare,' I'll do it the first minute I see him"" ""As for consequences, I don't care that for 'em;"" ""I don't want to know what's going to happen to him."" ""Take care of your heart, Bopp, for she has a bad habit. ""Well, but soberly, now, I wish you wouldn't plague Bopp,"" said Dolly. ""I'd rather have him for a brother than any one I know, for he's a regular trump though he is poor"" ""If you don't, I won't have the dear old fellow floored just because you like to see it done,"" said her brother. ""You needn't laugh, for I am,--I think I ought to interfere,"" said the head of the family. ""But if you like him, all serene. I'd rather be with him than any other man I know"" ""I'm not going to acknowledge such a weakness,"" said Bopp. ""It's evident to me that he is hit."" ""I don't know what to say,"" replied Dolly, ""but I'm glad you. Dick Bopp teased his girlfriend, and she fibbed about it. She was vexation of spirit, but both maintained that it was the right thing to do. Bopp's teasing was manlike, and demanded her confidence before she had made up her mind to give it. He teased her before she made up. ""Dear me! what a sudden spasm of virtue,"" said Dolly. ""Why, if it is such a sin, has not the 'head of the house' taken his sister to task before, instead of indulging in a like degeneracy, and causing several interesting persons to tear their hair, and bewail his forgetfulness?"" said Dick. ""Bah! they were only girls, and it don't amount to anything among us young folks,"" said the girl. ""But Bopp is a grown man, and you ought to respect him too much to play such pranks with him,"" said Dick, ""and you're too young to know better"" ""Bah!"" said the girls, ""but Bopp's too young for such things!"". ""Would you have me meet him at the door with a meek courtesy, and say, 'Oh, if you please, I'm ready to say Yes, thank you'?"" ""Don't be a goose, child; you know I mean nothing of the kind"" ""You girls never will do anything straight ahead if you can dodge and fuss and make a mess of it"" ""Do make up your mind, and says yes or no, right off, Dolly."" ""You're a honey-pot one day and a pickle-jar the next"" ""I'm a German, and more tender-hearted than we rough Yankees."" ""I've never seen such a. ""What in the world should I do with a great yellow-haired laddie who could put me in his pocket, and yet is so meek that I should never find the heart to henpeck him?"" ""Don't try to be cutting, Dolly, because you look homely when you do, and it's a woman's business to be pretty, always"" ""With you for a friend, be can have no earthly wish ungratified"" ""I like him well enough as a leader; he is clever, and sort of cunning, and I enjoy his funny ways"". ""I wish the town wouldn't put its fingers in other people's pies, and you may tell it so, with my compliments"" ""I shall do exactly as I please; dance, walk, ride, and flirt, whenever and with whomever I see fit"" ""The whole town, with Mr. Dick Ward at their head, can't stop me if I choose to go on"" ""Every one likes him, and will be down upon you for a heartless little wretch"" ""You will be in a nice state of mind if you damage Bopp"" ""It's perfectly fair that we should show you the worth of the thing"". Dolly folded her arms, wheeled about and faced her brother, a spirited statuette of Self Will, in a red hood and mittens. Dick sternly asked, ""Is that your firm decision, ma'am?"" ""Yes,"" Dolly replied. ""And you will not give up your nonsense?"" ""No,"" she said. ""We will, sir."" ""Very good. Now, then, what next?"". The twins were strolling home from school, which school must be briefly alluded to in order to explain the foregoing remarks. Ward knew, by the cock of Dick's hat and the decided tap of Dolly's heels, that a storm was brewing. To many of the lookers-on, the new order of things was as good as a puppet-show. The actors performed their parts heartily, forgetting the audience in their own earnestness. The twins were very happy, and their parents were happy, too. But the twins were also very unhappy, and the parents were very unhappy. They were also unhappy, because the twins had been left out of the school play. They had been playing a game which is too apt to end in a checkmate for one of the players.. ""Let those laugh who will, for here all was honest, and the old world had not taught them falsehood, self-interest, or mean ambitions. When they lost or won, they frankly grieved or rejoiced, and wore no masks except in play, and then got them off as soon as possible"" ""Let those who will laugh, for all was true, and all was good, and there was no need to be ashamed of it"" ""There was no reason to be afraid of it, for it was the only thing that kept us alive."" ""There were no reasons not to be proud of it. It was the best thing that ever happened to us."" ""It was the most beautiful thing to have happened to me, that I was able to live. Ned, with a wisdom older lovers would do well to imitate, went in for another game of foot-ball, gave the rejected apple to little Sally, and whistled ""Glory Hallelujah,"" instead of ""Annie Laurie"" Or, when Tom put on Clara's skates three successive days, and danced with her three successive evenings, leaving Kitty to freeze her feet in the one instance and fold her hands in the other. Dick and Dolly were foremost in the ranks, and expert in all the new amusements. Tom found his little friend a sweetheart in nature as in name.. Dolly was seldom seen without a staff of aids who would have ""fought, bled, and died"" for her as cheerfully as the Little Corporal's Old Guard. Dick worshipped at many shrines, but most faithfully at that of a meek divinity. Dolly had a right womanly heart of her own, though she had never acknowledged the fact till August Bopp looked at her with so much love and longing in his honest eyes. She had a tendency to regard him with peculiar good-will and tenderness developed itself, much to her own surprise. She was a woman of the highest order, and had a great sense of humor, but she was also a very clever girl. She knew how to read and write, and was a good writer, but had a. Dolly Bopp's mother suspected her daughter's feelings for her husband. But she kept them to herself, knowing that her daughter would give her confidence. Dolly's love for Mr. Bopp grew stronger, and she was forced to admit it. The two became lovers, and Dolly became his mistress. The story of Dolly and Dick is told in a novel called ""Dolly and Mr.Bopp"" (1881) by Dolly Boppy. The novel is about a young woman who falls in love with her husband, and learns to love him back. The book is also about a girl who learns to hate her husband and to love another man, and the two become lovers. The author also tells of the time when Dolly wooed another Dolly.. When Dolly was quiet and absent, he became pensive, the lesson dragged, and people fancied they were getting tired of the humbug. When Dolly is blithe and bland, he grew radiant, exercised within an inch of his life as a vent for his emotions. Mr. Bopp, became a bewildered weathercock, changing as the wind changed, and dire was the confusion occasioned thereby. Like the sage fowl in the story, Dick said nothing, but ""kept up a terrible thinking,"" and, not having had experience enough. ""Old Bopp"" was a boyish love of ruling the young person who ruled every one else. The town was electrified by a general invitation to the annual jubilee at Jollyboys Hall. Young ladies were obscured by tarletan fogs, behind which they concocted angels' wings, newspaper gowns, Minnehaha's wampum, and Cinderella's slippers. ""The town gave itself up, like a kind grandma, to the wishes of its children,"" says the author. ""It gave itself. up,like a kind grandmother, to its children, let them put its knitting away, disturb its naps, keep its hands busy with vanities of the flesh,"" says author.. ""What shall I go as?"" was the universal cry. Garrets were taken by storm, cherished relics were teased out of old ladies' lavendered chests (happy she who saw them again!), hats were mended. Inspired but incapable boys undertook designs that would have daunted a costumer of the first water, fell into sloughs of despond, and, emerging, settled down into jovial tars, friar waterproofs, and officers in miscellaneous uniforms. Fathers laughed or grumbled at the whole thing and advanced pecuniary loans with good or ill grace, as the case might be. But the mothers, whose interest in their children's pleasure is a sort of ever"

""You'd better go and live with the pigs, dirty child,"" said Maria.. Betty slept as long as she liked, with no school, no errands, no patchwork to do. She had a fine walk in her nightgown, and saw the flowers asleep. She watched the fireflies and moths at their pretty play.. Betty lived in this queer way a long time, and soon looked more like a pig than a little girl. Her nightgown got dirty, her hair was never combed, her face was never washed, and she loved to dig in the mud till her hands looked like paws.. The story of a pig who became too lazy and fat to care for anything but sleeping and eating. She asked the pigs how they managed in winter, but they only grunted. She could not remember what became of them, for the sty was always empty in winter.. Betty was smuggled down between the great fat piggies to keep warm. She was trying to pull the straw over them when she heard Mr. Gleason say to his boy, ""We must kill those pigs to-morrow"". Betty slipped upstairs to the nursery and was going to whisk into bed, when she saw in the glass an ugly black creature, all rags and dirt, with rumpled hair, and a little round nose covered with mud. ""Can it be me?"" she said. ""How. Betty was afraid of being a pig. Her mother told her it was all a dream. Betty said she was glad she had had the dream. She was afraid she would never be clean again.. ""Come, Maria, soap and scrub as much as"
0.64,0.74,49.25438596491228,"Kitty, a little girl, was given a pair of shoes by her mother. She said she didn't like them, but they made her run faster. She also said she wished they were seven-leagued boots, like Jack the Giant Killer's. The shoes made her trot faster, and she was soon running again. The story of Kitty is told in the book ""Kitty"" by John Steinbeck, published in 1881. The book is about a girl who refuses to run, but ends up doing it anyway.. Kitty's mother called from the next room, ""Kitty, run and tell the cook to make a pie for dinner; I forgot it"" Kitty's shoes gave one jump, and took her downstairs, through the hall, and landed her at the kitchen door. They went nicely till she wanted to turn into the china-closet where the cake was. She was forbidden to touch it, but loved to. ""I won't tell any one about these dreadful shoes, and I'll take them off as soon as I get home,"" she said. ""I can't stop!"" cried Kitty; and she did not till the shoes took her straight into the office. ""What's the hurry to-day?"" asked the man, as he saw her without any hat, all rosy and breathless, and her face puckered up as if she didn't know whether to laugh or to cry. ""You will have time to go to the post-. ""I hope they will go back slowly, or people will think I'm crazy,"" said Kitty to herself, as she took the letters and went away. The shoes wouldn't stop, though she tried to make them, and held on to the railing as hard as she could. Her feet went on; and when she sat down they still dragged her along so steadily that she had to go.. Kitty's legs were so tired with the long skips that she was glad to sit still. The minute she gave up, all went smoothly, and she got home in good time. Kitty's shoes danced her off, and landed her at her desk in five minutes. She wished she had come pleasantly, and not been whisked away without any luncheon. But she did, and that pleased the teacher, for generally she was fussing about all lesson time.. Kitty's foot went down, and she felt so glad about it that she tried to be pleasant, fearing some new caper of those dreadful shoes. She began to see how they worked, and thought she would try if she had any power over them. But at recess she got into trouble again; for one of the children knocked down the house of corn-cobs she had built, and made her angry. She said to Dolly in a great hurry,--"". Kitty said it was her new shoes, and never told how queerly they acted. The little girls were charmed, and tried to imitate her, but no one could. They stood in a circle watching her dance till the bell rang, then all rushed in to tell about it. They were hoping to have good times now, hoping for good times. They all rushed to tell how she had jumped over the hedge. She said,--""Perhaps I can get it for you, Willy."" And over she jumped as lightly.. Kitty was asked to carry some bundles of food to her family. ""Oh, dear me! I do hate to lug those old clothes and bottles and baskets of cold victuals round. Must I do it?"" sighed Kitty, dismally. ""It would be right and kind, and would please me very much,"" said mamma. ""But you may do as you choose about it. I am very tired, and some one must go,"" she said. ""The little Bryan baby is sick and needs what I send,"" said the mother. ""I'm glad I decided to be good; now I shall have a lovely time,"" said Kitty to herself, as she trotted away with a basket in one hand, a bundle in the other, and some money in her pocket for a poor old woman who needed help. The sick baby's mother thanked her for the soft little nightgowns; the hungry children gathered round the basket of food, like young birds eager to be fed; and the old woman gave her a beautiful pink shell that her sailor son brought home from sea. When all the errands were done Kitty skipped away to Fairyland, feeling very happy, as people always do. Kitty sat on a cushion of moss, like the queen of the wood on her throne. A large black cricket with a stiff tail stared at her curiously. Kitty thought you were some relation of my cousin Grasshopper's. ""Bless my heart!"" said the cricket. ""I thought you're some relation to Grasshoppers!"" ""I'm not Grasshopping!"" said Kitty. ""You're Grasshopped!"" ""Yes, I am!"" ""But I'm not!"" ""No, you're not."" ""I am!"". Kitty heard all sorts of little voices, singing, laughing, chatting in the gayest way, and understood every word they said. Kitty was much surprised to be able to understand what the cricket said. ""I'm not a grasshopper; but I have on fairy shoes to-day, and so do many things that I never did before,"" answered Kitty. ""Make the most of this chance; for at sunset your shoes will stop skipping, and the fun all be over"". ""I wish my skipping shoes would let me fly up somewhere, instead of carrying me on errands,"" said Kitty. ""That is better than leap-frog,"" she said. ""I wish I could fly,"" she added, ""but I can't."" ""I want to fly,"" Kitty said, ""and I can,"" said the squirrels.. Kitty amused the family by telling what she had done and seen. But no one believed the Fairyland part, and her father said, laughing, ""Go on, my dear, making up little stories, and by and by you may be as famous as Hans Christian Andersen"" Kitty was delighted to hear that; for she had longed to go, and went on skipping as hard as she could, that she might learn some of the graceful steps the shoes took before the day was done.. ""Oh, please, a few minutes more,"" began Kitty, but was off like a flash. ""It has been a long day, and you are tired,"" said her mother. ""Get to sleep early, for Nursey wants to go out,"" said Kitty's mother. Kitty never forgot the little lessons she had learned: she tried to run willingly when spoken to. She remembered the pretty steps and danced like a fairy. And best of all, she always loved the innocent and interesting little creatures in the woods and fields, and whenever she was told she might go to play with them, she hurried away almost as quickly as if she had still wore the skipping shoes."

""The Chimes"" is a Christmas carol written by the English composer. The song is about the Father of the Chimes and his love for the poor. It is one of the most famous carols in the world. The chimes were written in the 17th century by Charles Dickens. The story is about a teacher who teaches his pupils charity and good-will. The carol is called ""The Father of The Chimes,"" and was written by Henry James.. Fairy tale of a man who sings to the spirits of the bells in a church. The story is based on the life of a young boy who was brought up in a poor family. The boy's father was a poor man, and his mother was an orphan. The man's mother was a widow, and the boy was a schoolboy. The tale is about a boy who is brought up by his father, and who is taken in by a fairy.

""Some of us wish they had more health and less excitement, more domestic accomplishments and fewer ologies and isms,"" he wrote.. ""There have been some important revivals in religion,"" he writes. ""Alarm bells have been rung, anathemas pronounced, and Christians, forgetful of their creed, have abused one another heartily"" ""But look--the first red streaks of dawn are in the East,"" he adds.

0.67,0.77,46.93877551020408,"The story of the death of Mrs. Solomon is told in the novel ""The Death of a Gentleman"" (1860) The novel is based on the events of July 10, 1860, in the town of Rivermouth, England. It is the story of a young woman who was killed by a train, and her death at the hands of the authorities. The story is told by the author, who was a friend of the family, and is believed to have been the daughter of Mrs Solomon's husband. The novel was published in 1860, and the story is now considered one of the most famous of all time.. The story is based on a real-life incident in a Puritan village. The author describes a woman in all her glory, dressed in a blazing red frock and a yellow crape bonnet. She was an imposing spectacle in the quiet street of that Puritan town. The story is about a young woman who is taken in by the sun and is taken on a trip to the seaside. She is taken to a small house near the wharves, in the darkened doorway of which she quenches her burning splendor. The woman, who was not named, is said to have been a woman named Margaret.. Mrs. Margaret O’Rourke, née Callaghan, issued from the small, dingy house by the river and regained the doorstep of the Bilkins Mansion in the same stealthy fashion in which she had left it. Not a living creature was to be seen save the dissipated family cat, who was sitting on the curbstone opposite, waiting for the hall door to open. Mr. Bilkins in spiral nightcap looked out on the sunny street. Mr Bilkins, in spiral evening cap, was looking at the house from one of the upper windows of the Mansion.. The writer's wife, Margaret, was married to a man 18 years younger than her. She had been in the family for nearly 20 years. The writer says the marriage was an act of ingratitude. He says she should not have married a man who was so young. She should have been married to someone older, he says. He writes: ""What does a young blade of twenty-two know? Not half so much as he thinks he does"" The writer's daughter-in-law was married for a year before she was allowed to leave the house.. Margaret O’Rourke, with the baddish cat following closely at her heels, entered the Bilkins mansion, reached her chamber in the attic without being intercepted, and there laid aside her finery. Two or three times, while arranging her more humble attire, she paused to take a look at the marriage certificate, which she had deposited between the leaves of her prayer-book. She afterward declared that when she saw the two sitting there so innocent-like, not dreaming of the comether she had put upon them, she secretly and unbeknownst let a few tears fall into the cream pitcher.. The town clock was striking eleven, and the antiquated timepiece on the staircase was lisping the hour, when there came three tremendous knocks at the street door. The admirable old lady had for years been carrying on a guerrilla warfare with itinerant venders of furniture polish, and pain-killer, and crockery cement, and. the like. In fact, the whole breakfast was a comedy of errors, and it was a blessed relief to Margaret when the meal was ended. She retired in a cold perspiration to the penetralia of the kitchen.. The knock was at the door of Mrs. Bilkins' home. The person outside was a slightly built but well-knitted young fellow. He was wearing the not unpicturesque garb of our marine service. He had a sparse, sandy beard and a short yellow hair that had broken into innumerable curls of painful tightness. The door was opened by a woman who was carrying a bundle of notes and envelopes. The young man was smiling vaguely at her. She said he was a friend of her husband's and that he had come to see her. He said he had been sent by a friend to visit her. The pair had a good laugh.. A drunken sailor standing on the step of the Bilkins mansion was no novelty. The house abutted directly on the street; the granite doorstep was almost flush with the sidewalk. The huge old-fashioned brass knocker was nailed against the oak as a warning to malefactors. Mr. Larry O’Rourke of Mullingar, County Westmeath, and late of the U.S. sloop-of-war Santee was a pre-Raphaelite portrait of Mr. O'Rourke. He had a weak, good-natured mouth, a pair of devil-may-care. The knocker at the Bilkins mansion would frequently startle the quiet neighborhood long after midnight. There appeared to be an occult understanding between it and the blue-jackets. Of course Mrs. Bilkins had her taste in the matter, and preferred them sober. But as this could not always be, she tempered her wind, so to speak, to the shorn lamb. Perhaps that is why no blue-jacket, sober or drunk, was ever repulsed from the door.. “There’s no wife for you here,” said Mrs. Bilkins, somewhat taken aback. “His wife!” she thought; “it’S a mother the poor boy needs.” “To have and to howld,’ continued Mr. O’Rourke, wandering retrospectively in the mazes of the marriage service. “The man’s crazy,” said Mrs. Bilkins severely. “Bedad, thin, but she does.” “Sorra a place else.’ ““If you’re a married man, all I have to say is, there’t a. ""I want me wife,"" he said sternly to Mrs. Bilkins. ""The idea that she was conversing with a madman sent a chill over her,"" she said. Mr. O’Rourke partly turned his head and smiled upon her with conscious superiority. ""I want you wife,” he said, “and I want you now.” “I’m not afraid of you,’ she replied. “You’re drunk.’’ ‘I want my wife, and I want her now. ‘‘’. “It’s only Larry, mum,” said the man, touching his forelock politely. “He don’t mane a ha’p’orth o’ harum, but jist now he's not quite in his right moind.” “I should think not,’ said Mrs. Bilkins, turning from the speaker to Mr. O’Rourke, who had seated. “Misther Donnehugh,” responded Mr. O’Rourke with great dignity, “ye’re dhrunk again.” “He’s a dacent lad enough”—this to Mrs. Bilkins—“but his head is wake up.’’ “Hasn’t the. “Sure, mum, he has a family; wasn’t he married this blessed mornin’?” “No, mum; he’s an orphan.’ ‘“Indade, thin!” inquired Mrs Mrs.. “Is it the wife, ye mane?” exclaimed Mrs. Bilkins. “Good heavens! this man’s as crazy as the other!” “Begorra, if anybody's crazy, it’S Larry,” said Mr. Margaret Callaghan was wiping the breakfast things. Mrs. Bilkin’s voice during the latter part of the colloquy had been pitched in a high key. “Is it there ye are, me jew’l!” cried Mr. O’Rourke, discovering her.“Ye—yes, mum,” faltered Mrs. O'Rourke. Margaret O'Rourke and Mr. Bilkins wed on Anchor Street, London. They chose to halt at the small, shabby tenement-house by the river. Mr. O’Rourke’s intoxication seemed to have run down his elbow, and communicated itself to Margaret. The pair disappeared with a reeling, eccentric gait, through the doorway of the tenement. The story is based on the novel ""Majorie Daw"" by"

Fortunately the bone was very skilfully set by the surgeon who chanced to be in the drugstore where Flemming was brought after his fall. He is doing perfectly well physically; but I must confess that the irritable and morbid state of mind into which he has fallen causes me a great deal of uneasiness. His temper has become something frightful. He's the last man in the world who ought to break his leg, and he is no longer amiable.. Flemming has a complete set of Balzac's works, twenty-seven volumes, piled up near his sofa, to throw at Watkins whenever that exemplary serving-man appears with his meals. Miss Fanny Flemming came up from Newport, where the family are staying for the summer, to nurse him; but he packed her off the next morning in tears. When this fit is on him--and it sometimes lasts all day--nothing can distract his melancholy. He refuses to eat, does not even read the newspapers; books, except as projectiles for Watkins, have no charms for him. His state is truly pitiable. Now, if he were a poor man, with a family depending on his daily labor, this irritability. If he continues to give way to his vagaries in this manner, he will end by bringing on an inflammation of the fibula. I am at my wits' end to know what to prescribe for him. I have anaesthetics and lotions, to make people sleep and to soothe pain. But I've no medicine that will make a man have a little common-sense. That is beyond my skill, but maybe it is not beyond yours. You are Flemming's intimate friend, his fidus Achates. Write to him, write to him frequently, distract his mind, cheer. The letter was written to John Lemmming, a friend of Edward Delaney's. The letter was sent from New York to Lemming's home on West 38th Street, New York. Lemmings wrote to Delaney to say that his father's health made it impossible for him to leave his son. The two men had promised to spend a glorious month together at the sea-side. Delaney wrote back that his leg was not as bad as first reported and that he would be able to go back to work in two to three weeks if he had patience.. ""I have hours of time on hand, and I will write you a whole post-office full of letters, if that will divert you. Heaven knows, I haven't anything to write about. It isn't as if we were living at one of the beach houses,"" he writes. ""We have rooms in a cross-road, two miles from the hotels, and lead the quietest of lives. I think he has much improved; the sea air is his native element, but he still needs my arm to lean upon in his walks"" ""I wish I were a novelist. I would have written a book about you,"" he adds.. ""I wonder if even a Liza or an Alexandra Paulovna could stir the heart of a man who has constant twinges in his leg,"" he writes. ""I would hasten down to the Surf House and catch one for you,"" he adds. ""Or, better still, I would find you one over the way"" ""I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,"" he says. ""But I'm not going to let you down."" ""I'll be fine. I'm sure I will be fine,"" he replies. ""Just stay with me a little longer."" ""Yes, I will,"" says the man.. The house is a self- possessed, high-bred piece of architecture, with its nose in the air. It stands back from the road, and has an obsequious retinue of fringed elms and oaks and weeping willows. Sometimes in the morning, and oftener in the afternoon, when the sun has withdrawn from that part of the mansions, a young woman appears on the piazza with some mysterious Penelope web of embroidery in her hand, or a book. There is a hammock over there--of pineapple fibre, it looks from here. A hammock is very becoming when one is. ""Drop me a line, dear Jack, and tell me how you really are. State your case. Write me a long, quite letter. If you are violent or abusive, I'll take the law to you"" ""I haven't moved for five thousand years. I'm of the time of Pharaoh"" ""My left leg weighs three tons. It is embalmed in spices and smothered in layers of fine linen, like a mummy. I can't move"" ""The window of my bedroom looks down on that piazza--and so do I"". Watkins glides into my chamber, with that colorless, hypocritical face of his drawn out long like an accordion. I know he grins all the way down stairs, and is glad I have broken my leg. I've an idea that Watkins is tapping the old gentleman's Chateau Yquem. Hibernian swarries in the front basement. Young Cheops up stairs, snug in his cerements. I think I could bring him down with a copy of Sainte-Beuve or the Dictionnaire Universel, if I had it. These small Balzac books somehow do not quite fit my hand; but I shall fetch him yet.. ""Old Dillon fancies that I have something on my mind. He drives me wild with lemons. Lemons for a mind diseased! Nonsense. I am only as restless as the devil under this confinement"" ""Send me a screed, Ned, as often as you can, if you love me. Anything will do. Write me more about that little girl in the hammock"" ""Your letter is the first consoling thing I have had since my disaster, ten days ago"" ""I'll send the mare down to you at The Pines--is that the name of the place?"" ""I'm not used to this. It really cheered me up for half an hour"". ""I shall be a bear until I hear from you again. Tell me all about your pretty inconnue across the road"" ""You cannot imagine how this will occupy me. The more trifling, the better"" ""In a week or two I shall take to India rubber rings and prongs of coral"" ""I am passing into my second childhood. I shall be in India in a week."" ""I will be there for a few days, and then I will go home."" ""You really have a graphic descriptive touch, Edward Delaney, and I suspect you of anonymous love-tales in the magazines"" ""What is her name? Who is she? Who's her father?"". The sick pasha shall be amused. If the story-teller becomes prolix and tedious--the bow-string and the sack, and two Nubians to drop him into the Piscataqua! But truly, Jack, I have a hard task. There is literally nothing here--except the little girl over the way. She is swinging in the hammock at this moment. It is to me compensation for many of the ills of life to see her now and then put out a small kid boot, which fits like a glove, and set herself going. Who is she, and what is her. The daughter is called Marjorie--Marjorie Daw. This is the homestead, where father and daughter pass eight months of the twelve; the rest of the year in Baltimore and Washington. The New England winter too many for the old gentleman. Of course I shall make the acquaintance of my neighbors before many days. It will be next to impossible for me not to meet Mr. Daw or Miss Daw in some of my walks. The young lady has a favorite path to the sea-beach. I shall intercept her some morning, and touch my hat to her. Then the princess will bend her fair head to me with courteous surprise not unmixed with haughtiness.. The author's father and new neighbor were doing the antique polite to each other. Mr. Daw is a tall, slim gentleman of about fifty-five, with a florid face and snow-white mustache and side-whiskers. Mr Daw was a colonel in the late war, commanding the regiment in which his son was a lieutenant. Plucky old boy, backbone of New Hampshire granite. All this for thy sake, O Pasha of the Snapt Axle-tree!. . . How oddly things fall out! The writer's father was called down to the parlor, a sort of amphibious parlor.. The party, my dear Jack, was as dreary as possible. Miss Daw has a few friends coming, at 4 p.m., to play croquet on the lawn (parade-ground) and have tea (cold rations) on the piazza. Will we honor them with our company? (or be sent to the guard- house?) My father declines on the plea of ill-health. My father's son bows with as much suavity as he knows, and accepts.. The company broke up soon after tea, and I remained to smoke a cigar with the colonel on the piazza. It was like seeing a picture, to see Miss Marjorie hovering around the old soldier, and doing a hundred gracious little things for him. She brought the cigars and lighted the tapers with her own delicate fingers, in the most enchanting fashion. As we sat there, she came and went in the summer twilight, and seemed, with her white dress and pale gold hair, like some lovely phantom that had sprung into existence out of the smokewreaths.. I think the relation between an elderly father and a daughter just blooming into womanhood the most beautiful possible. If she had melted into air, like the statue of Galatea in the play, I should have been more sorry than surprised. The Polar Regions in a June thaw! It was exceedingly fine. What did we talk about? We talked about the weather--and you! The weather has been disagreeable for several days past--and so have you. I glided from one topic to the other very naturally. Igloo of the Isle of Shoals loomed up like a group of huge bergs drifting down on us.. I told my friends of your accident; how it had frustrated all our summer plans, and what our plans were. I played quite a spirited solo on the fibula. Then I described you; or, rather, I didn't. I spoke of your amiability, of your patience under this severe affliction. If you had been there, Jack, you wouldn't have known yourself. I should have excelled as a criminal lawyer, if I had not turned my attention to a different branch of jurisprudence. Miss Marjorie asked all manner of leading questions concerning you. When I got back to my room, I recalled how eagerly she leaned forward, with her full, snowy throat in strong moonlight, listening to what I said.. ""I am glad that the Daws are such pleasant people,"" he writes. ""The Pines is an isolated spot, and my resources are few,"" he adds. ""I might have made a target of the defenceless invalid; but I haven't a taste for artillery, moi"" ""Miss Daw is a girl whom you would like immensely, I can tell you that. Positively, I think I made her like you!,"" he says. ""Go on, my friend, you are keeping up a pretty lively fire on my inner. You may abuse me as much as you like, and I'll not complain; for I don't know what I should do without your letters. I haven't hurled anything at Watkins since last Sunday, partly because I have grown more amiable under your teaching, and partly because Watkins captured my ammunition one night, and carried it off to the library. He is still suggestive of the wine-cellar, however. You may break, you may shatter Watkins, if you will, but the scent of the Roederer will hang round him still. I like her already. When you spoke in your first letter of seeing a young girl swinging in a hammock under your chamber window, I was somehow strangely drawn to her. You seem to be describing a woman I have known in some previous state of existence, or dreamed of in. ""I lie awake nights, with my gas turned down to a star, thinking of The Pines and the house across the road. How cool it must be down there! I long for the salt smell in the air"" ""I send you and Miss Daw off on afternoon rambles along the beach. Sometimes I let you stroll with her under the elms in the moonlight"" ""Then I fall into a truculent mood, and would like to destroy somebody"" ""You would laugh in your sleeve, you wretched old cynic, if you knew how I lie awake at night"" ""If you were to send me her photograph, I believe I should recognize her at a glance"". Ned Delaney wrote to his friend John Flemmimim in 1872. He asked for news of a lover hanging around Lares and Penates. Delaney also asked for a photograph of Miss Daw's cartes-de-visite. He also asked about the mare that was due to arrive in Central Park this autumn. The letter was published in The New York Times on August 20, 1872, at 10 p.m. ET. For more, go to: http://www.nytimes.com/1872/08/20/magazine/. ""I am more and more struck by the beauty, modesty, and intelligence of Miss Daw"" ""She is young, rich, accomplished, uniting in herself more attractions, mental and personal, than I can recall in any girl of my acquaintance"" ""If we were shipwrecked together on an uninhabited island--let me suggest a tropical island, for it costs no more to be picturesque--I would build her a bamboo hut, I would fetch her bread-fruit and cocoanuts"" ""I wouldn't make love to her--not under eighteen months"" ""A woman neither beautiful nor wealthy nor very young could bring me to her feet. But not Miss Daw."". Flemming says he would like to have Miss Daw for a sister. He says he was impressed by her interest in his account of the accident. He adds that he may be all wrong in his premises and consequently in his conclusions; but you shall judge. Flemming: A greater misfortune could scarcely befall me than to love Miss Daw. He writes: ""I might shield her and counsel her, and spend half my income on old threadlace and camel's-hair shawls"" The author is now on holiday with his family in the South Atlantic, where he is writing a book about his experiences on the island of St. Vincent and the Grenadines.. ""Is it possible, than, that two people who have never met, and who are hundreds of miles apart, can exert a magnetic influence on each other? I have read of such psychological phenomena, but never credited them. I leave the solution of the problem to you"" ""You can conjecture how that passage in your letter of Friday startled me. You can conjectureHow that passage was produced on you by my casual mention of an unknown girl swinging in a hammock is certainly as strange"" ""I have seen Miss Daw perhaps ten times, perhaps oftener, and on each occasion I found that when I was not speaking of you, or your sister, or some person or place associated with you, I. was not holding her attention. She would be absent-minded"". I am not aware that any one is paying marked attention to my fair neighbor. The lieutenant of the navy -- he is stationed at Rivermouth -- sometimes drops in of an evening. I should not be surprised if he had an eye to the heiress; but he is not formidable. As for myself, all other things being favorable, it would be impossible for me to fall in love with a woman who listens to me only when I am talking of my friend! I am not sure that I would be able to do that. I have known a woman to satirize a man for years, and marry him after all. I would not want to be a man who had to listen to her satirize him for years.. Edwin Delaney writes to John Flemming. Letter is written in the style of a letter to a friend. Delaney is in love with a woman he has never seen. He writes: ""I do not understand it at all. I understand neither you nor her"" Delaney's letter to Flemmings is published in 1872 in the form of a book, ""The Love Affair,"" by Edward Delaney, published by P.W. Putnam's Sons, London, 1872. For more information on the book, visit: http://www.pw.com/books/the-love-aff. I am of the earth earth earthy, and I find myself in the incongruous position of having to do with mere souls, with natures so finely tempered that I run some risk of shattering them in my awkwardness. I am as Caliban among the spirits! I will hold back nothing from you. I do wrong to doubt the good sense that forms the basis of your character. You are deeply interested in Miss Daw; you feel that she is a person whom you may perhaps greatly admire when you know her. At the same time you bear in mind that the chances are ten to five that, when you do come to know her, she will fall far short of your ideal, and you will not care for her in the least.. The colonel drove, with my father in front, Miss Daw and I on the back seat. I resolved that for the first five miles your name should not pass my lips. I kept to my resolution, however; but on the return home I relented, and talked of your mare! Miss Daw is going to try a side- saddle on Margot some morning. The animal is a trifle too light for my weight. By the bye, I nearly forgot to say that Miss Daw sat for a picture yesterday to a Rivermouth artist. She is like the young lady in the rhyme, with the curl on her forehead, When she is good, She is very, very good, And when she is bad, she is horrid!"". I have just returned from the strangest interview with Marjorie. She gives sprays of mignonette to the rector, sprays to the lieutenant. She has even given a rose from her bosom to your slave. If the negative turns out well, I am to have a copy. So our ends will be accomplished without crime. If my letters sometimes read disjointed, you must understand that I never finish one at a sitting, but write at intervals, when the mood is on me. I wish I could send you the ivorytype in the drawing-room.. ""I accept things as people do in dreams,"" writes the writer. ""I see Marjorie walking in the garden with the colonel,"" he writes. ""It is past midnight, and I am too sleepy to write more"" ""My father has suddenly taken it into his head to spend a few days at the Shoals,"" he says. ""In the meanwhile you will not hear from me,"" he adds. ""You will not see me for a long time."" ""I have lost, through your aid, the faculty of being surprised,"" he concludes. ""And I will not be surprised if I never see you again"" ""I will be happy to see you,"" says the writer, ""but I will be glad to. Edwards Delaney wrote to John Flemming after returning from a trip to Appledore. The pair had been writing for five days. Delaney: ""As your leg grows stronger your head becomes weaker"" Flemings: ""You ask my advice on a certain point. I will give it"" Delaney's letter was sent on August 28, 1872, and is undated. It was the first of three letters to be written between the two men in 1872. The letters were sent after they returned from a visit to the enchanted island of Appledores, where Delaney paid four dollars per day.. You could do nothing more unwise that to address a note to Miss Daw, thanking her for the flower. It would, I am sure, offend her delicacy beyond pardon. Do you not see that, every hour you remain away, Marjorie's glamour deepens? You will ruin everything by precipitancy. Wait until you are entirely recovered; in any case, do not come wit you.’’ ‘‘I am sure that you will find it very difficult to cope with the situation,’ I said. ‘But you will be able to come back to The P"

The author was fascinated by his work and wanted to learn more about him..

The murder was not mentioned again, either then or afterwards. Mr. Jaffrey's apartment was filled with chintz, paper shades, and a collection of pipes. He spoke of the singing birds, but not about the murder.. “The wisest thing I ever did in my life was to sell out my grain business over at K——, thirteen years ago, and settle down at the Corners. I take it very easy here, I can tell you, summer and winter.. “If I had married Mehetabel,” said Mr. Jaffrey, slowly, and then he hesitated. “By all means, certainly, a son.”. ""Andy isn’t a bad nickname,” I suggested. “Not at all. We call him Andy in the family. Somewhat fractious at first. I suppose it is right, or it wouldn't be so. “Hush!” whispered Mr. Jaffrey, with a deprecating motion of his hand. “Poor little thing,” he cried, “to lose his mother so early!’ “Look at Andy. There’. He rose softly from the chair, and, walking across the room on tiptoe, drew down the shade at the window through which the moonlight was streaming. Then he returned to his seat, and remained gazing with half-closed eyes into the drooping em. “No doubt,” I said to myself that night, as I lay in bed, thinking over the matter, “this once possible but now impossible child is a great comfort to the old gentleman.” “I was very impatient to see if Mr. Jaff.

This history I would in turn inflict upon the reader, if I were only certain that he is one of those dreadful parents who, under the �.

The way that boy climbs sends a chill down my spine. The reflection came to me that if Andy had not been brought up by the rod, he had certainly been brought. up by lightning. He was eleven years old in two weeks! I essayed to tranquillise Mr.. Mr. Jaffrey sat bolt upright at the breakfast-table, looking as woe-begone as a bust of Dante, and retired to his chamber the moment the meal was finished. As the day advanced, the wind veered round to the north-east,. The author was staying at a boarding house in Greenton, Cornwall. He was staying with Mr Sewell, the landlord of the boarding house. The author was writing a book about the town. The book, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.. “He’s gone!” cried Mr. Jaffrey. “What, run away?” “No, he has fallen off a step-ladder and. The wind at Bayley’s Four Corners was so strong that it seemed to bear away the spirit of a little child. Mr. Jaffrey was sleeping peacefully when he opened his door. His face literally shone with geniality and happiness the next morning.. The boy had probably been dead several years then! However, the boy had likely been dead for several years. He chirped and prattled and carolled, and was sorry I was going away. But never a word about Andy.. “I see; our amiable friend is a little queer on"

While he is yet a baby lying in his cradle, he hears the dull, far-off boom of the breakers. The gables and roofs of the houses facing eastward are covered with red rust, like the flukes of old anchors.. Sailors are born with dreams of adventure. To own the whole or a portion of a rowboat is his earliest ambition. I longed to buy a part of the trim little sailboat Dolphin, which chanced just then to be in the market. Three shares, at five or six dollars each, had already been taken by Phil Adams, Fred Langdon, and Binny Wallace. The fourth and remaining share hung fire.. I am afraid I required but slight urging to join in the investment. I had four dollars and fifty cents on hand, and the treasurer of the Centipedes advanced me the balance. Unless a purchaser could be found for this, the bargain was to fall through. It was a proud moment when I stood on the wharf with my partners.. Tom Bailey's grandfather, Captain Nutter, was an experienced rower. He was strict about leaving the mast in the boat-house. The river was dangerous for sailboats, and the Captain feared for his life. Tom Bailey's father, Captain George Bailey, was a keen rower and skipper. He died in a tragic accident in the early 1980s.. Phil Adams skimming over the water in a spanking breeze with every stitch of canvas set. There were few better yachtsmen than Phil Adams. He usually went sailing alone, for both Langdon and Binny Wallace were under the same restrictions I was under. Squalls, without the slightest warning, were of frequent occurrence.. ""I never played truant (""hookey"" we called it) in my life,"" says the author. ""I was sincerely attached to Mr. Grimshaw, but I am afraid that the death of his uncle did not affect me as it ought to have done,"" he writes. ""We were up before sunrise the next morning, in order to take advantage of the flood-tide, which waits for no man. The Dolphin was the first boat Christopher Columbus took on the voyage of discovery. The crew included Phil Adams, Charley Marden, and a young man whose father had promised to cane him if he ever stepped foot on sail or row boat. Phil Adams contributed to the outfit a small tent of unbleached cotton cloth, under which we intended to take our nooning.. ""Guess you'll have a squally time of it,"" said Charley, casting off the painter. ""I'll drop in at old Newbury's"" (Newbury was the parish undertaker) ""and leave word, as I go along!"" ""Bosh!"" muttered Phil Adams, sticking the boathook into the string-. The scent of the new clover comes back to me now, as I recall that delicious morning when we floated away in a fairy boat down a river like a dream. The measured dip of our oars and the drowsy twitterings of the birds seemed to mingle with, rather than break, the enchanted silence that reigned about us. The sun was well up when the nose of the Dolphin nestled against the snow-white bosom of. Binny Wallace caught a cod for the chowder. The cod was a plump little fellow clustered all over with flaky silver. The fresh air and the exercise had given us the appetites of wolves. We were about famished by the time the savory mixture was ready for our clam-shell saucers. The banquet finished, Phil Adams drew from his pocket a handful of sweet-fern cigars; but as none of the party could indulge without imminent risk of becoming ill, we all, on one pretext or another, declined. The wind had freshened by this, and we found it comfortable to. ""We strolled along the beach and gathered large quantities of the fairy-woven moss, which at certain seasons is washed to these shores"" ""We're all right, anyhow,"" said Phil Adams. ""It won't be much of a blow, and we'll be as snug as a bug in a rug, particularly if we have that. Binny Wallace volunteered to go for them. ""Put an extra stone on the painter, Binny,"" said Adams, calling after him. ""It would be awkward to have the Dolphin give us the slip and return to port minus her passengers"" ""That it would,"" answered Binny, scrambling down the rocks.. ""Can you swim it?"" cried Adams desperately, using his hand as a speaking-trumpet, for the distance between the boat and the island widened momently. ""Binny Wallace looked down at the sea, which. Binny Wallace half rose from his seat in the stern, and waved his hand to us in token of farewell. He knew, and we knew, that the stoutest swimmer could not live forty seconds in those angry waters. The figure of Binny Wallace was no longer visible, for the boat itself had dwindled to a mere white dot on the black water.. The speck appeared again, for an instant, on the crest of a high wave. Then it went out like a spark, and we saw it no more. The wind and the breakers would have swept us into the ocean if we had not clung to one another with the desperation of drowning men. A sudden squall struck the sea, ploughing deep white furrows into. The gale had snapped all the fastenings of the tent but one. Held by this, the puffed-out canvas swayed in the wind like a balloon. Blinded by the vivid flashes of lightning, and drenched by the rain, we crept, half dead with fear and anguish, under our flimsy shelter. Neither the anguish nor the fear was on our own account, for we were comparatively safe, but for poor little Bin. The storm raged with augmented fury. We were obliged to hold on to the ropes of the tent to prevent it blowing away. The very island trembled with the concussions of the sea beating upon it. The breakers, streaked with angry phosphorus, were fearful to look at. The wind rose higher and higher, cutting long slits in the tent.. ""I say,"" whispered Fred Langdon, at last, clutching my hand, ""don't you see things--out there--in the dark?"" ""Yes, yes--Binny Wallace's face!"" said Adams. ""And I too,"" said Adams."" I see it every now and then, outside there"". ""I've wished a hundred times, since we've been sitting here, that I was in his place, dead or alive,"" says the author. ""What an endless night it was! I have known months that did not seem so long ago,"" he adds. ""We dreaded the approach of morning as much as we longed for it"" ""The day was certain to bring us relief from our prolonged absence, together with the storm,"" he says.. After a while we grew very hungry, not having broken our fast since early in the day. The rain had turned the hard-tack into a sort of dough; but it was better than nothing. We used to laugh at Fred Langdon for always carrying in his pocket a small vial of essence of peppermint or sassafras. We poured the stinging liquid over our sugar, which had kept dry in a sardine-. The Gloucester fishing fleet had gone down with every soul on board, just outside of Whale's-Back Light. Think of the wide grief that follows in the wake of one wreck; then think of the despairing women. ""Look, it is nearly daybreak!"" exclaimed Fred Langdon. ""Thank God!"" cried Mr Wallace. ""I've been waiting for it for days"" ""It's the first glimmering of sunrise,"" said Mr Langdon, ""and it's glorious"". The sea was still running too high for any small boat to venture out. Two picnic parties had started down river the day before, just previous to the gale, and nothing had been heard of them. It turned out that the pleasure-seekers saw their danger in time, and ran ashore on one of the least exposed islands. They passed the night, where they passed the day. The wherry took us back to town, leaving the yawl to. The excitement over, I was in a forlorn state, physically and mentally. Captain Nutter put me to bed between hot blankets, and sent Kitty Collins for the doctor. Shortly after our own arrival they appeared off Rivermouth, much to the joy of their friends, in two. The Dolphin was found floating keel upwards, four miles southeast of Mackerel Reef. Towards evening a high fever set in, and it was many days before my grandfather deemed it prudent to tell me that the Dolphin had been found. How strange it seemed, when I went to school again, to see that empty seat in the fifth row! How gloomy the playground was, lacking the sunshine.

0.82,0.9199999999999999,65.90321388991504,"A sculptor, named Alfred, who won the large gold medal and obtained a travelling scholarship, went to Italy, and then came back to his native land. On his return, he went to visit one of the little towns in the island of Zealand. One of the richest men in the place gave a party in his honor, and all who were of any consequence, or who possessed some property, were invited. Apprentice-boys, children of the poor, and even the poor people themselves, stood before the house, watching the lighted windows. There was quite an air of festivity about it, and the house was full of it; for Mr. Alfred, the sculptor,. was there. He was young at that time- indeed, he is young still, although he is ten years older than he was then.. ""I should like to see Rome,"" she said; ""it must be a lovely city, or so many foreigners would not be constantly arriving there"" She was very appreciative, and incredibly ignorant- a kind of female Gaspar Hauser. He talked and told anecdotes, and every one listened to him with pleasure, not unmingled with awe; but none felt so much respect for him as did the elderly widow of a naval officer.. ""I cannot very well describe it,"" said the sculptor, ""but you enter on a large open space, in the centre of which stands an obelisk, which is a thousand years old."" ""An organist!"" exclaimed the lady, who had never heard the word 'obelisk' Several of the guests could scarcely forbear laughing, and the sculpto would have had some difficulty in keeping his countenance. But the smile on his lips faded away when he caught sight of a pair of dark-blue eyes close by the side of the inquisitive lady. They belonged to her daughter; and surely no one. ""Has the pope a great family?"" inquired the lady. ""No,"" replied the young man. ""The pope is not allowed to marry,"" said the widow. ""I don't like that,"" was the lady's remark. ""That is not what I asked,"" persisted the widow, ""I mean, has he a wife and children?"" ""No, he does not come from a greatFamily,"" said Mr. Pope. ""He does not have a wife or children,"" said Mrs. Pope, ""but he does have a son and a daughter"". ""Beautiful Italy!"" sighed some of the guests. ""Oh, to travel there!"" exclaimed others. ""Yes, we must go,"" said the widow, ""but not to those parts where there are robbers"" ""I may perhaps win a hundred thousand dollars in the lottery,"" she said, ""and if I do, we will travel- I and my daughter; and you, Mr. Alfred, must be our guide"" ""Charming! Charming!"" echoed from every voice. ""We will keep to Rome,"" she added. ""I will take you to Rome."" ""Yes,"" said Alfred, ""I'll take you there."" ""And we will stay there,"" she replied. ""And I'll take my daughter to Rome"". The daughter sighed very gently; and how much there may be in a sigh, or attributed to it! The young man attributed a great deal of meaning to this sigh. Those deep-blue eyes, which had been lit up this evening in honor of him, must conceal treasures, treasures of heart and mind, richer than all the glories of Rome. When he left the party that night, he had lost it completely to the young lady. The house of the naval officer's widow was the one most constantly visited by Mr. Alfred. It was soon understood that his visits were not intended for that lady, though they were the persons who kept up the conversation. He came for the sake of the daughter. They called her Kaela. Her name was really Karen Malena, and these two names had been contracted into the one name KaelA. ""What power seemed to lie in the depths of those dark eyes! The young man felt the truth of the proverb, ""Still waters run deep:"" and his heart had sunk into their depths. He often talked of his adventures, and the mamma was as simple and eager in her questions as on the first evening they met"" He showed them colored plates of Naples, and spoke of excursions to Mount Vesuvius. The naval officer's widow had never heard of them before.. Alfred saw Pompeii, Herculaneum and Pompeii with his own eyes. Kaela's mamma asked him: ""So that is a burning mountain; but is it not very dangerous to the people who live near it?"" Alfred replied: ""Whole cities have been destroyed"" KaelA's m Mamma asked: ""Did you see it throw up white fire?"" Alfred answered: ""No; I did not see any of the eruptions which are represented in those pictures."" Kaeli's m Amma asked Alfred: ""Is it not dangerous to live near such a mountain?"" Alfred said: ""Yes, it is very dangerous. Alfred and Kaela were betrothed, which was a very natural result. The betrothal was announced in the newspaper of the little town. Mama purchased thirty copies of the paper, that she might cut out the paragraph and send it to friends and acquaintances. The pair were very happy, and the mother was happy too. She said it seemed like connecting herself with Thorwalsden. Alfred decided to take a bust of KaelA as well as of her mother. He called her his ""true successor of ThorwALSden"" The couple were married in September, 1847.. ""I suppose it is only on our account that you perform this common-place work yourself, instead of leaving it to your servant to do all that sticking together,"" said mamma. They sat to him accordingly, and saw how he moulded and formed the soft clay with his fingers. ""Ah, yes, you are always so polite,"" said Mamma, with a smile; and Kaela silently pressed his hand, all soiled as it was with the clay. He unfolded to them both the beauties of Nature, in all her works, and pointed out to them how, in the scale of creation, inanimate matter was inferior to animate nature.. Alfred and Kaela were married. Alfred was a sculptor. He was in love with Kaelas beauty. He spoke only to her, thought only of her, and the two became one. He and she were one, and he was always talking to her; and he and her were one. They were married in a secret ceremony in a country house. He had no idea she was there. She was not there. He did not know she was in the house. She had been there for a long time. He thought she had gone away. She said she had not gone away, but had gone to a friend's house.. Mamma-in-law had set up Thorwalsden's bust at the end of the table, attired in a dressing-gown; it was her fancy that he should be a guest. Songs were sung, and cheers given; for it was a gay wedding, and they were a handsome pair. Kaela looked like a doll in a doll's house, for everything was bright and new, and so fine. As for Alfred, a proverb may describe his position- he looked like the swan amongst the geese. The magic of form had enchanted him; he had looked at the casket without caring to inquire what it contained.. The young married pair often sat together hand in hand; he would talk, but she could only now and then let fall a word in the same melodious voice. It was a mental relief when Sophy, one of her friends, came to pay them a visit. Sophy was not, pretty. She was, however, quite free from any physical deformity, although Kaela used to say she was a little crooked; but no eye, save an intimate acquaintance, would have noticed it. Yet it never occurred to her that she might be a dangerous person in such a house. She never thought of being a danger to herself or anyone else. She had a very sensible girl, yet it never thought to be dangerous to her. It is a pity that she never saw the danger in her own house.. ""Thank heaven we are at home again within our own four walls,"" said mamma-in-law and daughter both, on their return after a year's absence. They felt the want of a change of air, and consequently the young couple and their mother travelled to Italy. ""To tell the truth, it's very wearisome; I beg pardon for saying so. I was soon very tired of it, although I had my children with me,"" she said. ""It's very expensive work travelling, very expensive. It must be done, for very shame,"" she added. ""You are sure to be asked when you come back if you have seen everything, and will most likely be told that you've omitted to see what. Sophy was a clever housewife, but well-informed and accomplished. She was also a generous-hearted, faithful girl. She showed that thoroughly while Kaela lay sick, fading away. When the casket is everything, the cask should be strong, or else all is over. And all was over with thecasket, for KaelA died. The story of Sophy is told in a novel called ""Sophy"" by the same name. The novel is about a young woman who is taken in by a family of Madonnas. The book is called ""The Madonna's Daughter"" and is published by Simon & Schuster at £16.99.. Alfred wept, and mamma wept. They both wore mourning. A beauty ought to be perfect, and Kaela was a perfect beauty. ""Pygmalion loved his Galatea,"" was in the song they sung at my first wedding. But the kindred soul, which is a gift from heaven, the angel who can feel and sympathize with and elevate us, I have not found and won till now. You came, Sophy, not in the glory of outward beauty, though you are even fairer than is necessary. The chief thing still remains: The chief things still remains.’’ ‘I once fell in love with a beautiful statue, which awoke to life in my arms; but the. kindred soul which can feel, sympathize, elevate us. ""That was not a loving speech,"" said Sophy, ""nor spoken like a Christian. You came to teach the sculptor that his work is but dust and clay only, an outward form made of a material that decays"" ""In yonder world, where we shall know each other from a union of mind, we shall be but mere acquaintances,"" said Kaela. ""In a future state, where there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage, but where, as you say, souls are attracted to each other by sympathy, there everything beautiful develops itself, and is raised to a higher state of existence"" ""You will then once more utter your first rapturous exclamation of your love,"

He knows so many fairy tales and stories that it is a pleasure to hear him talk. ""Yes, if I could think of a new one to tell,"" said the old man. ""Very likely you will have a story in the meantime"" says the mother. ""But how did the little fellow get his feet Wet?"" asked he.. ""How did the little fellow get his feet wet?"" asked he. ""Ah,"" said the mother, ""that is what we cannot make out"" ""Mother says that you can turn everything you look at into a story, and everything, even, that you touch"" ""Ah, but those tales and stories are worth nothing. The real ones come of themselves; they knock at my forehead and say, 'Here we are!'"" ""Won't there be a knock soon?"" asked the boy.. ""A little boy looked at the teapot and saw the lid raise itself gradually and long branches stretch out, even from the spout, in all directions till they became larger and larger, and there appeared a great elder tree covered with flowers white and fresh"" ""Oh, how fragrant the blossoms were!"" he cried all at once, ""here we have it; look! there is a story in the teacup now."" ""Yes, if a story comes of itself, but tales and stories are very grand; they only come. ""The Romans and Greeks called her a dryad,"" said the old man. ""They call her Elder-flower Mother, and you must pay attention to her now, and listen while you look at the beautiful tree"" ""I know when the golden wedding is to be,"" said she, but they did not hear her. ""I am the most beautiful thing in the world,"" said a young boy. ""And I am the only one who can see it."" ""I'm the most Beautiful Woman in the World,"" said an old man, ""and I can't tell whether it's a myth or a real thing."". ""The Old Sailor"" is a story about an old sailor's childhood. The story is told by the sailor's daughter. The tale is told from the perspective of a young girl. The sailor tells how he used to play in the garden in the yard where the story takes place. He tells how a sprig of elder took root and grew into a great tree under the old house. The old woman tells of how she planted the sprig and it grew into the tree.. ""I used to cry about you,"" said the old sailor, 'for I thought you must be lying drowned at the bottom of the sea' ""How we both cried on that day! But in the afternoon we went hand in hand up to the round tower and saw the view over Copenhagen and across the water"" ""I had to sail on a very different voyage elsewhere and be away from home for years on long voyages,"" said she. ""I got up in the night to see if the weathercock had turned;[180] it turned often. ""I laughed and wept at the same time, I was so happy,"" she said. ""I stood reading by the dustbin, with the rain pouring down, when all at once somebody came and clasped me round the waist."" ""I did not know that it was you,"" she replied; 'but you had arrived as quickly as your letter, and you looked so handsome, and, indeed, so you are still."" ""You gave him such a box on the ears that they tingled,' said the old man. ""You looked quite fine,"" she added.. The old couple were talking about their great-grandchildren. The old sailor said: 'Was it not about this time of year that we were married?' Elder-tree Mother replied: 'Yes, and to-day is the golden-wedding day' The old people clasped their hands together and said they would wish them joy. Presently came their children and grand*-children. They had already wished them joy on that very morning, but the old people had forgotten it, although they remembered so well all that had happened many years before.. ""But that is not a story,"" said the little boy who had been listening. ""Not till you understand it"" said the old man. ""But let us ask the Elder Mother to explain it."" ""It was not exactly a story"" said The Elder Mother, ""but the story is coming now, and it is a true one"" ""The Elder Mother nodded in the tree and cried 'Hurrah. The Elder Mother took the little boy out of bed and laid him on her bosom. The blooming branches of elder closed over them so that they sat, as it were, in a leafy bower. The bower flew with them through the air in the most delightful manner. Then the Elder Mother all at once changed to a beautiful young maiden, but her dress was still of the same green stuff, ornamented with a border of white elder blossoms such as the Elder mother had worn. In her bosoms she wore a real elder flower, and a wreath of the the same was entwined in her golden ringlets.. The story is about a boy and his friends riding through the country. They are led by an Elder-tree Mother, who tells them about their surroundings. The boy says they are going to a nobleman's estate, where they went last year. The story ends with the children riding back to the village. The child says: ""Hurrah! now we will ride many miles away"" The story is told in the form of a picture book, which is published by Chatto & Windus, at £16.99, in paperback.. The boy saw all that the little girl spoke of as she sat behind him on the stick. Then they played together in a side walk and raked up the earth to make a little garden. She took elder flowers out of her hair and planted them, and they grew just like those which he had heard the old people talking about. They walked about hand in hand too, just as the oldPeople had done when they were children. But they did not go up the round tower nor to Fredericksburg garden. The story is about a boy and a little girl who ride through the country. The boy's heart is filled with images of the country, and the little girl sings to him, ""You must never forget all this"" The boy is also filled with memories of the sweetest fragrance of a beech tree. The story ends with the boy's mother telling him that he will never forget the story of the girl and the tree. He says he will always remember the sweet fragrance of the elder tree.. ""Here it is delightful in summer,"" said the maiden, as they passed old knights' castles telling of days gone by. ""O that it were always spring in the fragrant beech groves!"" ""It is lovely here also in autumn,"" she said, and then the scene changed again. The sky appeared higher and more beautifully blue, while the forest glowed with colors of red, green, and gold. These were scenes never to be forgotten. ""It's a beautiful world out there, and I can't wait to see it again"". ""It is beautiful here in winter,"" said the maiden. The snow crackled beneath the feet. The dark blue sea was dotted with white sails. The young ones sang songs, and the old ones told fairy tales of wizards and witches. There could be nothing more pleasant than all this. ""Even the poorest child could say, ""It isbeautiful in winter"" ""It's a good thing to be a child,"" said a little boy. ""It means you are not a bad person"" ""You are not bad at all,"" replied the little boy, ""because you are a good person."". The boy who had given an elder blossom to a little girl as a keepsake is now an old man. He recalls the little girl looking at him from between the petals of the flower with her clear blue eyes, and hear her whispering, ""It is beautiful here at home in spring and summer, in autumn and in winter"" He is now holding his old wife under an elder tree in full blossom. They were holding each other's hands, just as the great-grandfather and grandmother had done, and spoke, as they did, of olden times and of the golden wedding. The boy is now a man, and his wife is a woman.. The story of the Elder-tree Mother was told to a man and his wife. The story was told like their own story, especially in parts which they liked the best. ""Some call me Elder Mother, others a dryad, but my real name is Memory,"" said the little maiden in the tree. ""I can think of the past and relate many things,"" she said. ""To-day is the golden wedding,"" she told them. ""And there they sat like a king and queen under the sweet-scented tree"" ""And so it is,"" she replied. ""Well, and so it's so."". The story was told to a little boy. The boy's mother covered him up, saying he should not take cold tea.

Then how Little Claus would smack his whip over all five horses, they were as good as his own. Now we shall hear what happened to them, for this is a true story. The story of the two men called Claus is told in the book, The Secret History of Claus, by Charles Dickens, published by Hodder & Stoughton, at £16.99, p&p, £12.99. To order a copy of the book for your own use, call the Mail on Sunday on 0203 615 4157 or visit www.mailon Sunday.com.. Little Claus would call out, Gee-up, my five horses! when any one passed him. Big Claus said he would hit his horse on the head if he said it again. Little Claus soon forgot what he ought to say, and called out again. The horse fell dead instantly, and the skin was hung to dry in the wind. The skin was later found to be the skin of a dead horse, and it was used to dress the dead horse. The dead horse was called the 'Horse of the North' and was called 'The Horse of the East' by the locals. The 'Horses of the West' were called 'Hares of the South' and 'Hare of the west. Little Claus was going to sell the horses skin in the next town. He lost his way in a dark, gloomy forest. Near the road stood a large farmhouse. The farmers wife opened the door, but told him to go away, as her husband would not allow her to admit strangers. Then I shall be obliged to lie out here, said Little Claus to himself, as the farmers wife shut the door in his face. The story was told in a book called The Adventures of Little Claus, published by P.C. Wilson in 1852, and is now being serialised by The New York Review of Books in a series called The New Adventures Of Little Claus. The series, which is now in its eighth year, is being serialized by the New YorkReview of Books.. Little Claus climbed to the roof of the farmhouse to make a bed. He could see into a room where a large table was laid out with wine, roast meat, and a splendid fish. The farmers wife and the sexton were sitting at the table together. If I could only get some, too, thought Little Claus. As he stretched his neck towards the window he spied a large, beautiful pie,indeed they had a glorious feast before them. At this moment he heard some one riding down the road, towards the farm house. It was the farmer returning home. He was a good man, but still he had a very strange prejudice,he could not bear the sight of a sexton. The farmer was a very kind man, and his wife was very kind to him.. The sexton had gone to visit the farmers wife during her husbands absence from home, and the good woman had placed before him the best she had in the house to eat. When she heard the farmer coming she was frightened, and begged the sexton to hide himself in a large empty chest that stood in the room. He did so, for he knew her husband could not endure the sight of a sexton. The woman then quickly put away the wine, and hid all the rest of the nice things in the oven; for if her husband had seen them he would have asked what they were brought out for.Oh, dear, sighed Little Claus from the top of the shed, as he saw all the good things. Little Claus was lost and begged for a nights lodging. The woman received them both very kindly, laid the cloth on a large table, and placed before them a dish of porridge. The farmer was very hungry, and ate his porridge with a good appetite. But Little Claus could not help thinking of the nice roast meat, fish and pies, which he knew were in the oven. Under the table, at his feet, lay the sack containing the horses skin. Now Little Claus did not relish the porridge at all.. The story is about a farmer who conjured up a sack of food for his family. The sack contained roast meat, fish, and pie. The farmer's wife hid the food under the table, and the family ate it. The story was told by the farmer's son, Little Claus, who was a conjuror. The family ate the food, but the farmer thought it had been conjured by a wizard. The tale was later turned into a children's book, ""Little Claus"". The farmer would have liked such a conjuror as Little Claus carried in his sack. Could he conjure up the evil one? asked the farmer. I should like to see him now, while I am so merry, said Little Claus. So the woman was obliged to bring out the wine also, which she had hidden, and the farmer drank it till he became quite merry. The farmer said he would know who it was, so I shall not mind. But he said he could not endure the sight of a sexton. However, that doesnt matter, I shall know who he is, so he said. He said he was not afraid of the man.. Little Claus was told to open the chest in which his wife had hidden the sexton, who now lay inside, very much frightened. The farmer opened the lid a very little way, and peeped in. He saw him, springing backwards, and he is exactly like our sexton. He said: ""Oh, cried he, springed backwards, I saw him and he's exactly like my sexton"" The farmer then asked Little Claus to hold the lid firmly, that he may not slip out of the chest. Little Claus offered to sell his conjuror for a bushel of gold. The farmer said he would take away the chest as well. Little Claus gave the farmer the sack containing the dried horses skin, and received in exchange a bushell of money. The story was told by the author in a book called 'The Adventures of Little Claus' The book was published in London in 1903 and is still being published today. The author has since moved to the United States. The book is called 'Little Claus and the Story of a Bushel of Gold' and is published by Simon & Schuster at £16.99. For more information on the book, visit www.simonandschuster.com.. Little Claus was given a wheelbarrow to carry away the chest and the gold. The farmer also gave him a broad, deep river. The water flowed so rapidly that very few were able to swim against the stream. The sexton lay still concealed. Little Claus stopped in the middle of a bridge and said, loud enough to be heard by the sexton, Now what shall I do with this stupid chest; it is as heavy as if it were full of stones. The sexton seized the chest in his hand and lifted it up a little, as if he were going to throw it into the water. ""I will give you a whole bushel full of money if you will let me go,"" said Little Claus, opening the chest. ""Oh, no; oh, no, cried the sexton,"" said the boy, ""I must throw him into the river, that he may be drowned"" ""I am not afraid of the river,"" replied the boy. ""If it swims. The sexton crept out, pushed the empty chest into the water, and went to his house. Then he measured out a whole bushel full of gold for Little Claus, who had already received one from the farmer, so that now he had a barrow full. The sexton then returned to his room and emptied all his money into a heap on the floor. He then sent a boy to Great Claus to borrow a bushel measure. Great Claus smeared the bottom of the measure with tar, that some of whatever was put into it might stick there and remain.. Great Claus asked Little Claus, Where did you get so much money? Little Claus said, for my horses skin, I sold it yesterday. Great Claus seized a hatchet, and knocked all his four horses on the head, flayed off their skins, and took them to the town to sell. And so it happened; for when the measure returned, three new silver florins were sticking to it. Great Claus was beaten to death by the shoemakers and tanners. He was forced to run as fast as he could. The old grandmother of Little Claus died. The story is told in the play ""The Adventures of Santa Claus"" by the children's playwright, Hans Christian Andersen. The play is set in the town of Santa Cruz. The main character, Santa Claus, is a huntsman. The book is about Santa Claus and his hunting experiences. The plot involves the hunt for Santa Claus' dead grandmother. The author has no idea how the story ends, but believes it will.. Little Claus' grandmother had been cross, unkind, and really spiteful to him. He was very sorry, and laid her in his warm bed to see if he could bring her to life again. During the night, as he sat there, the door opened, and in came Great Claus with a hatchet. He knew well where Little Clauss bed stood, and struck the old grandmother on the head. There, cried he, now you cannot make a fool of me again. Then he dressed his old grandmother in her best clothes, borrowed a horse of his neighbor, and harnessed it to a cart. He placed the old woman on the back seat, so that she might not fall out as he drove, and rode away through the wood. He then went home.. Little Claus and his grandmother were travelling in a wagon. They stopped for a drink, and the landlord gave them a glass of mead. Little Claus asked for a glass for his grandmother, who could not hear him. The landlord said he would bring her a glass, and gave it to her. The woman did not speak, but sat quite still in the wagon. She was later found dead in the back of the wagon, with her head resting on her hands. The story was told by a friend of Little Claus' in a book called 'The Story of a Grandmother'. The landlord threw a glass of mead in the face of his grandson's grandmother. When she did not stir, he flew into a passion and threw it in her face. The glass struck her on the nose, and she fell backwards out of the cart. Little Claus rushed out of a door and grabbed the landlord by the throat. The landlord said he would bury his grandmother as if she were his own. He then gave Little Claus another bushel of money and buried her. The story was told in a play called The Death of the Landlord by the playwright David Lean. The play was set in the town of Loughborough, in the county of Suffolk.. Great Claus killed his old grandmother with a hatchet, and sold her for a bushel of money. Little Claus asked Great Claus to lend him a buschel measure. Great Claus went to Little Claus, and took the bushel measure with him. How did you get all this money? asked Great Santa Claus, staring with wide open eyes at his neighbors treasures. ""I killed her with a blow, that I might get a bushell of money for her,"" said Little Claus. ""Heaven preserve us!"" cried the apothecary, you are out of your mind!"" said Great Santa. ""You killed my grandmother instead of me, said Little Santa, so I have sold her"". Great Claus got so frightened that he rushed out of the surgery, jumped into the cart, whipped up his horses, and drove home quickly. The apothecary and all the people thought him mad, and let him drive where he liked. So as soon as he reached home he took the largest sack he could find and went over to Little Claus. He laid hold of Little Claus round the body, and pushed him into the sack, which he took on his shoulders. Now Im going to drown you in the river, he said, saying, Now Im Going to drown You in the River. He had a long way to go before he reached the river and Little Claus was not a very light weight to carry. So he had to carry the body a very long way before reaching the river.. Little Claus was in a sack and could not get out of it. Great Claus put him down close to the church-door. He thought he might as well go in and hear a psalm. So in he went. The people were in church; so in he go. He could hear the organ playing and the people singing beautifully. He went in and heard the psalms. He was very happy. He said: 'I was so happy. I was so pleased' He went home. He told his story to his son.. Little Claus told the old drover he was going to heaven. The old man crept into the bag to take care of his cattle. When Great Claus came out of church, he took up the sack, and placed it on his shoulders. It appeared to have become lighter, for the old Drover was not half so heavy as Little Claus. So he threw the sack containing the olddrover into the water, believing it to be Little Claus, believing that it was the old man. He then walked off with all the cows and oxen. The story is told in the book, ""Little Claus,"" by Hans Hofmann, published by P.W. Putnam.. Great Claus was driving the cattle when he came to a place where two roads crossed. Little Claus said he had been thrown into the river about half an hour ago. The wind whistled in his ears when you threw me into the River, and I sank to the bottom immediately. But I did not hurt myself, for I fell upon beautifully soft grass which grows down there. And in a moment, the sweetest little maiden came towards me. She had snow-white robes, and a wreath of green leaves on her wet hair. She said: 'I am above you now, I am really very rich. I was frightened, to be sure, while I lay tied up in the sack'. The sea-maiden told him to go a mile farther on the road, and I should find a whole herd of cattle. The bed of the river was covered with the loveliest flowers and sweet fresh grass. How handsome all the people were, and what fine cattle were grazing on the hills and in the valleys! But why did you come up again, said Great Claus, if it was all so beautiful down there? I should not have done so? Well, said Little Claus, it was good policy on my part; you heard me say just now that I was told by the sea- maiden to go to the spot where the river terminates. And I did so, and there were some cattle for you to begin with.. Great and Little Claus went to the bottom of the river to get sea-cattle. Great Claus said he would carry Little Claus down to the river in a sack. Little Claus said she would creep into a sack and go with him. The pair went down the river and across the fields to get the cattle. The river was a long way, so Little Claus took a different route. The result was a much shorter journey. The story was told in a book called ""The River of Love"" by William Makepeace Thackeray, published in 1881. The book was about the adventures of a young boy and his father. It was written by the author, who was himself a child of two.. Great Claus put a stone in a bag and gave it a push into a river. The stone sank to the bottom of the river. Little Claus then drove his own beasts homewards. The story was told in the book The Cattleman's Guide to the World. The book is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99.

She asked a fairy for a barleycorn, and when she planted it in a flower-pot, a tulip appeared. Within the flower, upon the green velvet stamens, sat a very delicate and. A little girl was born in a house in the country. She was called Tiny, because she was so small. She had a bed made of blue violet-leaves, and a rose-leaf for a counterpane. She also had a boat, and could sing. The story of the toad and his mother is told in the book of the same name. It is the story of a young boy who was born into a family of frogs. The story of his mother's birth is about a young girl who is born into the family of. The old toad swam out with her ugly son to the leaf on which she had placed poor little Tiny. She wanted to fetch the pretty bed, that she might put it in the bridal chamber to be ready for her. The toad bowed low to her in the water, and said, Here is my son. Tiny could not bear to think of living with the old toad and having her ugly son for a husband. The little fishes, who swam about in the water beneath, had seen the toad, and heard what she said. They assembled together in theWater, round the green stalk. Tiny tied a green leaf to a butterfly, and it floated away on the brook. A large cockchafer flew by, and seized her round her delicate waist. He flew with her into a tree, and could not get away.. Tiny was very pretty, though not in the least like a cockchafer. She was really the loveliest creature that one could imagine, and as tender and delicate as a beautiful rose-leaf. During the whole summer poor little Tiny lived quite alone in the wide forest.. Tiny lived in the rain and in the sun. She sucked the honey from the flowers for food, and drank the dew from their leaves every morning. She wove herself a bed with blades of grass, and hung it up under a broad leaf, to protect herself from the rain.. Tiny the field-mouse had been without a morsel to eat for two days. She came to the door of a field- mouse who had a little den under the corn-stubble. The field-mice was very pleased with Tiny, so she said, You are quite. Tiny the field-mouse had a neighbor who was a mole. The mole fell in love with her because she had such a sweet voice. Tiny was obliged to sing to him, Lady-bird, lady-bird.. A mole had dug a long passage under the earth, which led from the dwelling of the field-mouse to his own. He warned them not to be alarmed at the sight of a dead bird which lay in the passage. The mole took a piece of phosphorescent wood in his mouth, and it glittered like fire in the dark.. The mole pushed it aside with his crooked legs, and said, How miserable it must be to be born a little bird! I am thankful that none of my children will ever be birds, for they can do nothing but cry, Tweet, tweet, and always die. Tiny could not sleep, so she got out of bed and wove a large, beautiful carpet of hay. Then she carried it to the dead bird, and spread it over him. It was the birds heart; he was not really dead, only benumbed with the cold.. Tiny, who was only an inch high, laid the wool more thickly over the poor swallow. She then took a leaf which she had used for her own counterpane, and laid it over the head of the poor bird. The swallow was wounded in a thorn-bush, and could not fly as fast as the others. The whole winter the swallow remained underground, and Tiny nursed him with care and love. Neither the mole nor the field-mouse knew anything about it, for they did not like swallows. Tiny was very fond of the poor swallow. The corn which had been sown in the field over the house of the field-mouse had grown up high into the air, and formed a thick wood to Tiny. Tiny had to turn the spindle.. Tiny was not at all pleased; for she did not like the tiresome mole. Every evening the mole visited her, and was continually speaking of the time when the summer would be over. Then he would keep his wedding-day with Tiny. But now the heat of the sun was so great that it burned. The sun was to be taken away to live with a mole. Tiny did not like the sun. The mole was a very handsome man. The queen herself does not wear more beautiful velvets and furs. You ought to be very thankful.. The swallow told how unwilling she felt to marry the ugly mole, and to live always beneath the earth, and never to see the bright sun any more. Cold winter is coming, said the swallow, and I am going to fly away into warmer countries. Will you go with me? You can sit. Tiny was carried by a swallow through the warm countries of Europe. The swallow took her to a palace of dazzling white marble, built in the olden times. The palace was the home of the swallow who carried Tiny, but Tiny could not live there.. Tiny was placed on one of the broad leaves of a large white flower. In the middle of the flower was a tiny little man, as white and transparent as if he had been made of crystal. He. Tiny was the angel of the flower. He was the king of them all. He took the gold crown from his head, and placed it on hers, and asked her name, and if she would be his wife, and queen.. The story of Tiny and Maia is told by a swallow. The swallow was asked to sing a wedding song for Tiny. He did as well as he could, but in his heart he felt sad for"

'I sat number twenty-one from the old Mouse King, so that I was not badly placed. The courses were very well arranged—mouldy bread, bacon rind, tallow candle, and sausage—and then the same dishes over again from the beginning' 'A capital toast was drunk to the inventor of the soup, and it was said he deserved to be a relieving officer,' said another.. 'A Mouse King promised that the young mouse who could best prepare that soup should be his queen' 'That was not at all bad,' said the other Mouse; 'but how does one prepare this soup?' 'Ah, how is it prepared?' 'That is just what all the young female mice, and the old ones too, are asking' 'They would all very much like to be queen,' replied the Mouse King, 'but they don't want to take the trouble to go out into the world to learn how to prepare the soup' 'Such were no doubt the thoughts by which most of them were scared from going out to gain information' 'And away from home one can't get cheese rinds and bacon every day' 'No, one must bear hunger, and. The Mouse King invited all mice within a circuit of many miles to a meeting. They were to assemble in the kitchen, the three travelled Mice stood in a row by themselves, while a sausage-peg, shrouded in crape, was set up as a memento of the fourth, who was missing. No one was to proclaim his opinion before the three had spoken and the Mouse King had settled what was to be said further. The Mouse King then gave the mice their freedom. The mice were allowed to go on their way, but they were not allowed to return.. The First little Mouse had seen and learned in her Travels. And now let us hear what she had learned. She had been told that the ship's cook must know how to manage things at sea. But it is easy enough when one has plenty of sides of bacon, and whole tubs of salt pork, and mouldy flour. We sailed along for many days and nights ; the ship rocked fearfully, and we did not get off without a wetting. And she had also learned that one does not learn to prepare soup on a sausage-peg.. 'It is a wonderful thing, to go out of one's own corner at home, and sail in a ship, where one has a sort of corner too, and then suddenly to find oneself hundreds of miles away in a strange land,' he writes. 'I saw great pathless forests of pine and birch, which smelt so strong that I sneezed, and thought of sausage' 'I associated with the forest and field mice, who, by the way, know very little, especially as regards cookery, though this was the very thing that had brought me abroad,' he adds. 'They belong to the goose family — one can see that by their walk ; for no one can deny his parentage'. 'The thought that soup might be boiled on a sausage-peg was such a startling idea to them, that it flew at once from mouth to mouth through the whole forest' 'Little did I think that there, on the very first night, I should be initiated into the method of its preparation' 'What has a little mouse to do with a May dance?' 'I sat in the soft moss and held my sausage- peg fast' 'I saw a maypole. Men and maids danced round the tree, and sang as loudly as they could, to the violin of the fiddler' 'There were merry doings at sundown and in the moonlight, but I took no part'. 'All at once, the most charming little people came marching forth. They looked like men, but were better proportioned' 'They called themselves elves, and had delicate clothes on, of flower leaves trimmed with the wings of flies and gnats' 'The moon shone especially upon one spot, where a tree stood, covered with moss so fine that I may almost venture to say it. ""I will lend it,"" I said, ""but not to keep."" ""Not to keep!"" they all repeated. ""I gave up the sausage-peg, which I gave up to them, and danced away to the spot where the fine moss grew"" ""They wanted to have a maypole of their own, and the one they now had, seemed cut out for them."" ""They decorated it so that it was beautiful to behold. Little spiders spun it round with gold thread, and hung it all over with fluttering veils and flags, so finely woven, bleached so snowy white"". 'And now began such music! It sounded like thousands of glass bells, so full, so rich, that I thought the swans were singing' 'I heard children's voices, the sound of bells, and the song of birds; the most glorious melodies' 'And all came from the elves' maypole, namely, my sausage-peg' 'There is not in all the world such a maypole as they had made of it' 'They took colours from the butterfly's wing, and strewed these over the white linen, and flowers and diamonds gleamed upon it.' 'I was quite touched. I should never have believed that so much could come out of it.'. 'The night was far too short; but it is not longer up yonder at that season. Six elves brought me back my sausage-peg, and asked me at the same time if I had any wish that they could gratify' 'I asked them if they could tell me how soup was made on a sausage- peg. I wept, as a little mouse may weep, with pure pleasure' 'And then I told them in so many words, why I had undertaken a journey, and what hopes were founded on it at home' 'You only mean that as a joke,' said the chief of the elves, with a smile.. ""I cannot shake it out of the sausage-peg, and say, 'Look, here is the peg, now the soup will come,' that would be a dish that could only be put on the table when the guests had dined,"" said the Mouse King. ""What advantage,"" I asked, ""can it be to our Mouse King, and to our whole powerful state, from the fact of my having witnessed all this festivity?"". 'I think I've given you something to carry home, and a little more than something!' said the elf. 'But what was the ""something more"", of which you spoke?' asked the Mouse King. 'I think it is what they call effect!' she replied. '""Violets,"" the elf said to me, ""are for sight, and smell, and touch!' 'And herewith she turned the staff round, and lo! there was not a single flower to be seen upon it' 'And so I think I have given you a little bit of something more,' said the Mouse king.. 'That was a heavy soup!' said the Mouse King. Therefore it yet remains to provide for hearing and taste!""'The little Mouse flourished her baton more and more wildly; the pots foamed, threw up large bubbles, boiled over, and the wind roared and whistled through the chimney. Oh! it became so terrible that the little Mouse lost her stick at last' 'The little mouse is the most beautiful creature in the world!' said one of the mice. 'The most beautiful mouse in the whole world' said another. 'And the most wonderful mouse in all the world is the little mouse who beats time'. The Second Mouse was born in the palace library. He was told of the royal prize offered to those who could cook soup upon a sausage-peg. The Mouse King asked him what he had to tell. The Second Mouse said he had never seen a kitchen before. He had been forced to suffer hunger in the library, but got a good deal of knowledge. The King asked what the next story would be about. The second Mouse said that he had not yet heard about the preparation of the soup. 'That was all,' said the little Mouse, with a bow. 'Shall we not soon hear about the Preparation?'. 'I went out to find out what it was like to be an ant' 'I knew that I had to be wise to be a human being' 'If you have understanding, then you can be a good person' 'You must have the courage to be yourself' 'Be the first to do it' 'Don't be afraid to be the first' 'The first step is to be aware of your own humanity' 'Become a human' 'Learn to be your own person' - 'become your own master' 'Find out what you are' - ""become a person"" 'Be your own best friend'. The ant queen is number one, and her view is the only correct one, she has absorbed all wisdom. She spoke so much, and it was all so clever, that it sounded to me like nonsense. Everything with them is like a well-worked sum, that comes right. To work and to lay eggs, they say, is to live while you live, and to provide for posterity. They were divided into the clean and the dirty ants. The rank of each is indicated by a number, and the ant queen was number one. She declared her ant-hill was the loftiest thing in the world, though close by it grew a tree, which was certainly loftier, much loftier.. The Mouse saw an ant who made the same discovery as another ant. The ant queen declared that by so doing they exhibited at once heart and understanding. ""These two qualities,"" she said, ""place us ants on the highest step among all reasoning beings"" ""I have the greatest share of understanding,"" said the ant queen, ""and I raise myself on my hind legs"" ""The ant queen"" was the first ant to discover the existence of the solar system, and the first to discover that it was a system of planets and stars. The Mouse said that the ants had a great respect for the sciences, and that they were the most intelligent creatures in the world. ""The ants have a great understanding of the universe,"" said he, ""but they are not so wise as to understand it fully."". 'I could not be mistaken, and I ate her up. Go to the ant and be wise—and I had got the queen!' 'I knew that a living being dwelt here, a Dryad as it is called, who is born with the tree, and dies with it' 'I spoke to her in a friendly and intimate way, and bade her take courage. And she took me up in her delicate hand' 'She promised me that perhaps on that very evening I should have one of the two treasures of which I was still in quest' 'And so I went and found the queen' ' and so I came to the end of the world'. The Dryad told how Phantasy, the god of love, rested under the leafy boughs of the tree. He called her his Dryad, she said, and the tree his tree, for the grand gnarled oak was just to his taste. ""Yes,"" the Dryad continued, ""the birds sing aloft there and tell of strange countries; and on the only dead bough the stork has built a nest which is highly ornamental"" ""And, moreover, one gets to hear something of the land of the pyramids,"" she said. ""All that is very pleasing to Phantasy; but it is not enough for him."" ""I myself must tell him of life in the woods, when I was little,"" she added.. 'And when Phantasy came the feather was plucked, and I seized it,' said the little Mouse. 'I held it in water, till it grew soft. It was very hard to digest, but I nibbled it up at last. Take that—no better is given to any poet—and it will be enough for you!"" ''I knew that the third was to be found in the library,' he said. 'A great man has said and written that there are romances whose sole and single use is that they relieve people of their superfluous tears' ''No better is give to any. 'I betook myself back to the library, and devoured nearly a whole novel' 'When I had digested this, and a second one in addition, I felt a stirring within me, and I ate a bit of a third romance, and now I was a poet' 'I began thinking what kind of stories could be made to refer to a sausage-peg' 'The ant queen must have had a particularly fine understanding.' 'I thought of being screwed up a peg, of standing on one's own pegs, and of driving a peg into one's Own coffin' 'And I said so to myself, and told the others also'. 'Peep! peep!' was heard at the kitchen door, and a little Mouse—it was the fourth of them, the one whom they looked upon as dead—shot in like an arrow. She toppled the sausage-peg with the crape covering over. All my thoughts ran upon pegs; and when one is a poet (and I am a poet, for I have worked most terribly hard to become one) a person can make poetry on these subjects. I shall therefore be able to wait upon you every day with a poem or a history—and that's the soup I have to offer' 'Let us hear what the third has to say,' said the Mouse King.. The Mouse who spoke before the Third spoke. She spoke at once, and spoke fully. She had appeared so suddenly that no one found time to object to her speech or to her, while she was speaking. And now let us hear her. She said: 'The whole thing is soup on a sausage-peg,"" said the jailer; ""but the soup may cost him his neck.""' The prisoner looked pale, and had a great beard and bright sparkling eyes. The Mouse slipped into his prison. There's a mouse-hole to be found behind every locked door. The prisoner had spoken unconsidered words. These words had given rise to others, and these latter had been written. The prisoner lured me with bread crumbs, with whistling, and with friendly words. He was glad to see me, and I got to trust him, and we became friends. He shared with me his bread and water, gave me cheese and sausage; I lived well, but I must say that it was especially the good society that kept me there. He let me run upon his hand, his arm, and into his sleeve; he let me creep about in his beard, and called me his little friend. I really got to love him, for these things are reciprocal. I forgot my mission in the wide world, forgot my sausage-peg in a crack in the floor—it's lying there still.. 'Soup on a sausage-peg!' said the jailer, to whom I now went; but I should not have trusted him. He took me in his hand, certainly, but he popped me into a cage, a treadmill. That's a horrible engine, in which you go round and round without getting any farther; and people laugh at you into the bargain' 'The jailer's granddaughter was a charming little thing, with a mass of curly hair that shone like gold, and such merry eyes, andsuch a smiling mouth!' ''You poor little mouse,"" she said, as she peeped into my ugly cage; and she drew out. The author lived in an old tower with a watchman and an owl. The owl was a respectable, well-educated old owl. ""Do not make soup on a sausage-peg"" were the hardest words she could prevail on herself to utter, she was so fondly attached to her family. Her conduct inspired me with so much confidence, that from the crack in which I was crouching I called out ""Peep!"" to her.. ""Soup on a sausage-peg"" was only a human proverb, and was understood in different ways, the owl said. ""Each thinks his own way the best, but the whole really signifies nothing,"" she added. ""Truth is not always agreeable, but truth is above everything,"" the owl told the author. ""I was quite struck. Truth is not sometimes agreeable,but truth isabove everything,"" he said. 'I begged the owl to give me the recipe for this soup, and then she explained the matter to me. This confidence of mine pleased her hugely' "". 'I hastened away, that I might get home in time, and bring the highest and best, that is above everything—namely, the truth' 'Your truth is a falsehood,' said the Mouse who had not yet spoken. 'I can prepare the soup, and I mean to prepare it' 'I've not learned what I know from supernatural beings, or gobbled it up, or held converse with owls,' said another Mouse. 'Will you just put that kettle upon the fire and get water poured in up to the brim! Now make up the fire, that the water may boil—it must boil over and over!'. The longer the King stirs it, the more powerful will the soup become. It costs nothing at all—no further materials are necessary, only stir it round!' 'The power is contained only in the tail of the Mouse King,' replied the Mouse. 'We'll wait for the soup till our golden wedding, so that the poor of my subjects may have something to which they can look forward with pleasure for a long time' 'Of course—certainly you are my Queen,' he said. And soon the wedding was held. 'And soon the Wedding was held'. The story went round the world; and opinions varied concerning it, but the story remained as it was. And that's the best in great things and in small, so also with regard to soup on a sausage-peg—not to expect any thanks for it. 'I should have told it so—and so —and so!'Thus said the critics, who are always wise—after the fact"

""Great ones, first, of course,"" said he, ""and then the little ones; but size is not always a proof of greatness."" He stretched out his thin leg as he spoke. ""And pray what do you want?"" asked the farriers. ""Golden shoes,"" replied the beetle. ""Why, you must be out of your senses,"" cried the farries. ""I am not out of my senses,"" said the beetle, ""I just want a pair of golden shoes."" The Emperor's horse had a golden shoe on each foot, and why was this? He was a beautiful creature, with slender legs, bright, intelligent eyes, and a mane that hung down over his neck like. ""Golden shoes for you, indeed!"" replied the farrier. ""It is done to annoy me, so I intend to go out into the world and seek my fortune"" ""You're a rude fellow,"" cried the beetle, as he walked out of the stable. ""I understand that it is a personal slight to me,"" said the beetle. ""Go along with you"" said the farriers. ""You'll get your money back."" ""I'll get my money back!"" said the beetles.. A beetle was walking through a field when he saw a caterpillar crawling along. The caterpillar said, ""How beautiful this world is!"" The beetle replied, ""I am accustomed to better things"" Then he spread his wings and flew away. The story is told in the novel, ""The Secret of Paradise,"" by Charles Dickens.

He was tumbled over and over with the rain, sometimes swimming on his stomach and sometimes on his back. After a while the weather cleared up a little, and the beetle was able to rub the water from his eyes, and look about him. He saw something gleaming, and he managed to make his way up to it. It was linen which had been laid to bleach on the grass. He crept into a fold of the damp linen, which certainly was not so comfortable a place to lie in as the warm stable, but there was nothing better, so he remained lying there for a whole day and night. He remained, quietly lying where he was, until the rain stopped. He began to doubt whether he should escape with his life. He said to himself, ""I don't want to be disgusted, and yet I can't help it."". Two frogs were sitting on the linen, and their bright eyes actually glistened with pleasure. ""Wonderful weather this,"" cried one of them, ""and so refreshing. This linen holds the water together so beautifully, that my hind legs quiver as if I were going to swim"" ""I should like to know,"" said another, ""If the swallow who flies so far in her many journeys to foreign lands, ever met with a better climate than this. What delicious moisture! It is as pleasant as lying in a wet ditch"" ""Have you ever been in the Emperor's stable?"" asked the beetle. ""There the moisture is. ""Is there not even a dunghill here in this garden, where a person of rank, like myself, could take up his abode and feel at home?"" But the frogs either did not or would not understand him. ""I never ask a question twice,"" said the beetle, after he had asked this one three times, and received no answer. Then he went on a little farther and stumbled against a piece of broken crockery-ware, which certainly ought not to have been lying there. But as it was there, it formed a good shelter against wind and weather to several families of earwigs who dwelt in it. Their requirements were not many, they were very sociable, and full of affection for their children. Each. ""Our son,"" said another, ""had scarcely crept out of the egg, when he was off on his travels. He is all life and spirits, I expect he will wear out his horns with running. How charming this is for a mother, is it not Mr. Beetle?"" for she knew the stranger by his horny coat. ""Now you shall also see my little earwigs,"" said a third and a fourth mother, ""they are lovely. The beetle was told to go to the nearest dung-heap. He asked his friends, all beetles, if they were comfortable. They said they were never ill-behaved, except when they were uncomfortable in their inside. The beetle then walked off without taking any formal leave, which is considered a polite thing to do. He then went to the next dung heap, which was on the other side of a ditch. He met his friends again, and asked them if they had any children. They replied that none of their children had ever gone so far. The beetles then said they had no children. The next dangap was on that side of the ditch, and the beetle went there.. ""Certainly,"" said the beetle, ""I shall be most happy; I have been exposed to the rain, and have had to lie upon linen, and cleanliness is a thing that greatly exhausts me"" ""I came from the emperor's stable, where I was born, with golden shoes on my feet,"" replied the beetle. ""It is really quite refreshing to be with one's own kindred again."" ""Perhaps you came from a dung-heap,"" observed the oldest of them. The beetle said: ""I am travelling on a secret embassy, but you must not ask me any questions, for I cannot betray my secret"" The beetle's intentions were serious, and after a while our friend was engaged. The mother gave them her blessing, and all the other beetles cried ""hurrah."" The beetle then married the girl, and they were all happy. The story was told in a book called ""The Beetle and the Queen of the Stables"" The book was written by the beetle's daughter, and published in 1872. The beetle is believed to have been. The beetle was taken in by a family of beetles. He stayed away all day and all night, and his wife remained behind a forsaken widow. In the morning two persons came up to the ditch and took him in. The beetle had sailed across the ditch on a cabbage leaf. He had been journeying on the other side. The story of the beetle and his family is told in the book ""The Vomit Beetle"" by William Makepeace Thackeray, published by Oxford University Press, London, in 1903. The book is entitled ""The Vagabond Beetle"" and is published by Thames & Hudson, £8.99.. The beetle was carried by two men, one of whom was a scholar. He was told that Allah sees the black beetle in the black stone, and the black rock. The beetle considered this speech a great insult, so he flew suddenly out of the speaker's hand. His wings were dry now, so they carried him to a great distance, till at last he reached a hothouse, where a sash of the glass roof was partly open. He quietly slipped in and buried himself in the warm earth. ""It is very comfortable here,"" he said to himself, and soon after fell asleep. Then he dreamed that the emperor's horse was dying, and had left him his golden shoes, and also promised that he should have two more. All this was very delightful, and when the beetle woke up he crept forth and looked around him.. The beetle was in a hothouse, with palm-trees and flowers. He thought of the dying horse, and the golden shoes he had inherited. A hand seized the beetle, and squeezed him, and turned him round and round. The gardener's little son and his playfellow wanted to have some fun with him. First, he was wrapped, in a vine-leaf, and put into a warm trousers' pocket. Then he prowled about in the earth, and thought what a pleasant dream that was about the dying Horse. He then thought of his relations in the hothouses. He said: ""I'm proud, certainly; but I'm also proud of being so."". The beetle was put into an old broken wooden shoe, in which a little stick had been fastened upright for a mast, and to this mast the beetle was bound with a piece of worsted. Now he was a sailor, and had to sail away. The lake was not very large, but to the beetle it seemed an ocean, and he was so astonished at its size that he fell over on his back, and kicked out his legs. Then the little ship sailed away; sometimes the current of the water seized it, but whenever it went too far from the shore one of the boys turned up his trousers, and went in after it, and brought it back to land. But at last, just as it went merrily out again, the two boys were called, and so angrily, that they hastened to obey, and ran away as fast as they could.. The beetle was bound to the mast of a ship. A fly came and paid him a visit. ""What beautiful weather,"" said the fly, ""I shall rest here and sun myself"" ""Don't you see that I am a prisoner?"" replied the beetle. ""Ah, but I'm not a prisoner,"" remarked the fly. ""I'm the only respectable person in it,"" replied the beetles. ""It's an abominable world,"" said a beetle to himself. ""This vexes me more than anything"" said the beetle of the mast. ""The emperor's favorite horse goes prancing about proudly on his golden shoes"" said another beetle. 'I'm only respectable' said the beetles, 'I have to lie on damp linen, and to stand in a draught'. ""It is useless to look for sympathy in this world,"" says the beetle. ""I am lost to the stable and to the world. It is all over with me"" The beetle's story is told in a book called ""The World's Most Famous Beetles"" The book is published by Simon & Schuster, Inc. (USA) (1934) (UK) (USA:    ""The World’s Most Famous Beetles"" (1936) ( UK:  “The World is Most Famous Beetle’ (1937) (US: “The world’S Most Famous Bug’(1937-1939) (U.S. “ The world” (1938) ‘The world does not deserve to be made acquainted with my adventures, for. A beetle flew through an open window, and sat on the mane of the emperor's favorite horse. He said: ""The world is not so bad after all, if you know how to take things as they come"" The sun's rays also came streaming into the stable, and shone upon him, and made the place lively and bright. ""Travelling expands the mind very much,"" said the beetle, ""and it is a splendid thing to have thy liberty"" The beetle then said: 'The answer is quite clear to me, now. They were given to the horse on my account.' He then added: 'It is a good thing to be free. It is a very good thing'"

But it was only heard for a moment, for the rolling of the carriages and the voices of the multitude made too great a noise.. A long time passed, and people said to each other--""I wonder if there is a church out in the wood?"" The bell has a tone that is wondrous sweet; let us stroll thither, and examine the matter nearer. It was as if the tones came from a church in the still forest. People looked thitherward, and felt their minds attuned most solemnly. The rich people drove out, and the poor walked, but the way seemed strangely long.. Three people claimed to have heard the sound of a bell in the forest. One said it sounded like the voice of a mother to a good dear child. The king of the country vowed that the sound should be named the Universal Bell. The sound was made by an owl, which knocked its head against the branches of a tree. But whether the sound came from his head or from the hollow tree, that no one could say with certainty.. The Bell-ringer wrote yearly a short treatise ""On the Owl,"" but everybody was just as wise as before. The Bell-Ringer was the first person in the world to be called the ""Universal Bell- Ringer"" The Bell Ringer was also the first man to be known as the ""Father of the Bell. Three girls were confirmed at a ball. One of them had to go home to try on a ball-dress. The other was a poor boy, who had borrowed his coat and boots to be confirmed in from the innkeeper's son. The third said that he never went to a strange place if his parents were not with him.. ""The Bell of the Wood"" is a story about a group of children who went to the woods to sing. The children were led to the willow-tree by a confectioner, who told them that the bell did not exist. The story is told in the book, ""The Bell Of The Wood,"" by William Shakespeare. The book is published by Simon & Schuster, Inc., at a price of £7.99.. The story of a man who heard a bell in a village. The man and his children went to investigate. They found a house with a small bell, but the bell was too small and fine to be heard at so great a distance. The bell made a strange gurgling sound, and the children thought it was the sound of the bell.. The King's Son was a king's son. He was a boy in wooden shoes, and with so short a jacket that one could see what long wrists he had. The boy was that one among the children who could not come because he had to go home and return his jacket and boots to the innkeeper's son, who was also a King'sSon. The King's son said, ""Such people always want to be wiser than everybody else"". ""Why, then, we can go together,"" said the King's Son. But the poor child was quite ashamed; he looked at his wooden shoes, pulled at the short sleeves of his jacket, and said that he was afraid he could not walk so fast. ""But there we shall not meet,"" said he, nodding at the same time to the poor boy.. The King's Son got some scratches too; but the sun shone on his path, and it is him that we will follow, for he was an excellent and resolute youth. ""I must and will find the bell,"" said he, ""even if I am obliged to go to the end of the world."" The ugly apes sat upon the trees, and grinned. ""Shall we thrash him? He is the son of a king!"" said they.. The King's Son climbed up a rock to see the sun set. He saw the sea and swans swimming in calm lakes. He heard a bell, but thought it came from the depths of the forest. He climbed up the rock before the sun had gone down. He then saw the sun and the sea from a great height. He said: ""I cannot find what I seek; the sun is going down, and night is coming"". The King's Son and the boy who had been confirmed with him ran towards each other in the vast church of nature and of poetry. Over them sounded the invisible holy bell: blessed spirits floated around them, and lifted up their voices in a rejoicing hallelujah! The red colors above faded away as the sun vanished, but a million stars were lighted, a million lamps shone. The King's son spread out his arms towards heaven, and wood, and sea; when at the same moment, coming by a path to"
0.86,0.96,72.74305555555556,"Five-and-twenty tin soldiers were made out of the same old tin spoon. They were given to a little boy for his birthday as a present. The soldiers were all exactly alike, except for one, who had only one leg. The table on which the tin soldiers stood, was covered with other playthings, but the most attractive to the eye was a pretty little paper castle. Through the small windows the rooms could be seen. In front of the castle a number of little trees surrounded a piece of looking-glass, which was intended to represent a transparent lake. The castle was a very pretty piece of art, and the little trees were meant to represent the lake, but it was too small to be seen through the windows. The little boy who made the castle said that it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen, and that it had made him very happy.. A tin soldier saw a pretty little lady in a castle. She was made of paper, and wore a dress of clear muslin. The tin soldier thought that she was his wife. But she was too grand, and lives in a castles, while he had only a box to live in. Still he thought he must try and make her acquaintance. He laid himself at full length on the table behind a snuff-box that stood upon it. He peeped at the little delicate lady, who continued to stand on one leg without losing her balance. He thought she was a dancer, and she raised one of her legs so high, that the tin soldier could not see it at all, and he thought she, like himself, had only one leg. He said: ""That is the wife for me,"" he thought; ""but she is too grand,. and lives at the castle, while I have only abox to live with five-and. The tin soldiers rattled in their box; they wanted to get out and join the amusements, but they could not open the lid. The nut-crackers played at leap-frog, and the pencil jumped about the table. There was such a noise that the canary woke up and began to talk, and in poetry too. Only the tin soldier and the dancer remained in their places. She stood on tiptoe, with her legs stretched out, as firmly as he did on his one leg. He never took his eyes from her for even a moment. He was always watching her.. The clock struck twelve, and, with a bounce, up sprang the lid of the snuff-box. But, instead of snuff, there jumped up a little black goblin. ""Tin soldier,"" said the goblin, ""don't wish for what does not belong to you"" But the tin soldier pretended not to hear. The children came in the next morning, they placed the tin Soldier in the window. Out fell the tinSoldier, heels over head, from the third story, into the street beneath. He came head downwards, his helmet and his bayonet stuck in between the flagstones, and his one leg up in the air. The servant maid and the little boy went down stairs directly to look for him; but he was nowhere to be seen.. The tin soldier was too proud to cry out for help while he wore a uniform. Two boys made a boat out of a newspaper, and sent him sailing down the gutter. The paper boat rocked up and down, and turned itself round sometimes so quickly that the tin soldier trembled; yet he remained firm. Suddenly the boat shot under a bridge which formed a part of a drain, and then it was as dark as the tin Soldier's box.""Where am I going now?"" thought he. ""Where do you want to go?"" he asked himself. ""I don't know,"" he replied. ""What do you need?"" he said. ""A boat to sail in."" ""A ship to go to the sea,"" said the boy who made the boat. ""And a boat to go home."" ""I'm going home,"" he said, ""and I'm going to get my musket."". The tin soldier could already see daylight shining where the arch ended. At the end of the tunnel the drain fell into a large canal over a steep place. He was too close to it to stop, so the boat rushed on. The soldier could only hold himself as stiffly as possible, without moving an eyelid, to show that he was not afraid. The boat sailed on and the rat followed it. But the tin soldier remained silent and held his musket tighter than ever. He heard a roaring sound quite terrible enough to frighten the bravest man. He could not stop the boat, and the river rushed on to the end. The tin soldier was killed by the black goblin, who had taken the soldier's musket. The story was told in a book called ""The Tin Soldier's Story"" by William Makepeace Thackeray, published in 18th century England.. The tin soldier stood up to his neck in water. The boat whirled round three or four times, and then filled with water to the very edge. He thought of the elegant little dancer whom he should never see again, and the words of the song sounded in his ears- - -""Farewell, warrior! ever brave, and drifting onward to thy grave."" - - - ""I will never forget you"" - -  ""I will always remember you,"" he said, ""and I will always love you"" – -  ""I am the son of a soldier, and I am a soldier too."" – - ""Fare well, warrior!"" – -""I love you, soldier!"" – – ""I love thee, soldier."" – – . The fish had been caught, taken to the market and sold to the cook, who took him into the kitchen and cut him open with a large knife. After a while, a flash of lightning seemed to pass through him, and then the daylight approached, and a voice cried out, ""I declare here is the tin soldier."" They placed him on the table, and- how many curious things do happen in the world!- there he was in the very same room from the window of which he had fallen. There were the same children, the same playthings, standing on thetable, and the pretty castle with the elegant little dancer at the door. It touched the tin soldiers so much to see her that he almost wept tin tears, but he kept them back. He only looked at her and they both remained silent. Presently one of the little boys took up the tin Soldier, and threw him into a stove. The soldier was not at all proud.. The flames lighted up the tin soldier, as he stood, the heat was very terrible, but whether it proceeded from the real fire or from the fire of love he could not tell. He looked at the little lady, and she looked at him. He felt himself melting away, but he still remained firm with his gun on his shoulder. The tin soldier melted down into a lump, and the next morning, when the maid servant took the ashes out of the stove, she found him in the shape of a little tin heart. But of the little dancer nothing remained but the tinsel rose, which was burnt black as a cinder. - - - ""I am the Tin Soldier"" by The Tin Soldier, by William Makepeace Thackeray, is published by Chatto & Windus, £3.99, and is available in hardback and paperback.

He had now to take care of his little sister Augusta, who was much younger than himself, and he was, besides, to learn his lesson at the same time. He sang to her all the songs he knew, and glanced the while into the geography-book that lay open before him. By the next morning he was to have learnt all the towns in Zealand by heart, and to know about them all that is possible to be known.. Tuk was a good boy, and helped the old woman over the way. He was now to go to bed; that was an old turn-up bedstead. In it he lay and thought about his geography lesson, and of Zealand. He ought, to be sure, to have read over his lesson again, but that, you know, he could not do. He could not think of such a thing, as to a light, there was no thought of such an thing. He lay in his bed and thought of his master, and all that his master had told him.. Tuk put his geography-book under his pillow, because he had heard that was a very good thing to do when one wants to learn one's lesson. Well, there he lay, and thought and thought, and all at once it was just as if someone kissed his eyes and mouth. It was as though the old washerwoman gazed on him with her mild eyes and said, ""It were a great sin if you were not to know your lesson tomorrow morning"" And all of a sudden the book under Tuk's pillow began scraping and scratching.. ""To see the Kjoge hens,"" is an expression similar to ""showing a child London,"" which is said to be done by taking his head in both bands, and so lifting him off the ground. At the invasion of the English in 1807, an encounter of a no very glorious nature took place between the British troops and the undisciplined Danish militia. ""I am a Kjoger hen,""* said she, and then she related how many inhabitants there were there. ""Thorwaldsen lived almost next door to me.* Plump! Here I lie capitally."". The story of the death of the Danish artist is told in a play by the same name. The play is set in the town of Ny Soe, Denmark, where he lived and died. The story is based on the life of the artist, who died in 1858. The film was directed by Lars von Trier, who also wrote the play's libretto, and was the subject of the novel ""Ny Soe"". ""Little Tukey"" is a children's book about a boy who dreams of a castle. When the castle crumbled away, Tukey was left with only a solitary tower. Tukey's dream was real, but he was not dreaming, says the author. The book is called ""The Little Castle"" and is published by Simon & Schuster, Inc. (P.S. A.C.P.E.D. 6/19/15)..

The poet Baggesen was born here. The town was called ""the most tiresome of towns"" before the introduction of steam-vessels. It is now called Roeskilde, as it is now known. The city was once known as ""Little Tuk"" and was the site of a battle between the Danes and the Germans in the 15th century. It was also known as the ""City of the Stars"" and the ""House of the Sun"" and ""The House of the Moon"" and is now a popular tourist destination. It has a population of around 100,000.. Little Tuk saw all, heard all. ""Do not forget the diet,"" said King Hroar. And up the slope into the old church went all the kings and queens of Denmark, hand in hand, all with their golden crowns. And the organ played and the fountains rustled. And now stood there an old peasant-woman, who came from Soroe,* where grass grows in the market-place. She had an old grey linen apron hanging over her head and back: it was so wet.. ""It is wet, it is wet; there is such a pleasant deathlike stillness in Sorbe!"" She was now suddenly a frog, ""Croak""; and now she was an old woman. ""One must dress according to the weather,"" said she. ""My town is just like a bottle; and one gets in by the neck, and by the Neck one must get out again!"" ""Crok! croak!"" she said. ""It is raining!"" ""It's wet!"" ""I'm going to get a bath!""

His mother undressed him, put him to bed, and had the tea-pot brought in to make him a good cup of Elderflower tea. Just at that moment the merry old man came in who lived up a-top of the house all alone; for he had neither wife nor children--but he liked children very much, and knew so many fairy tales, that it wasquite delightful.. ""Am I to hear a fairy tale?"" asked the little boy. ""You can make one in a moment,"" said the old man. ""But how did the child get his feet wet?"" asked his mother. ""That is the very thing that nobody can make out,"" said his mother, ""and that you can find a story in everything"" ""Ah, ah!

""The right sort come of themselves; they tap at my forehead and say, 'Here we are' The little boy looked at the tea-pot. The cover rose more and more; and the Elder-flowers came forth so fresh and white, and shot up long branches. Out of the spout even did they spread themselves on all sides, and grew larger and larger; it was a splendid Elderbush, a whole tree. How it bloomed! And what an odour! In the middle of the bush sat a friendly-looking old woman in a most strange dress"" ""I have it! Pay attention! There is one in theTea-pot!"". ""What's that woman's name?"" asked the little boy. ""The Greeks and Romans,"" said the old man, ""called her a Dryad"" ""The people who live in the New Booths* have a much better name for her,"" he said. ""They call her 'old Granny'--and she it is to whom you are to pay attention"" ""Just such another large blooming Elder Tree stands near the NewBooths"" ""Under it sat, of an afternoon, in the most splendid sunshine, two old people"" ""A little boy's first word for the woman is 'Granny' "". The couple were talking about old times. They had great-grand-children, and were soon to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of their marriage. But they could not exactly recollect the date. 'I know the date,' said she; but those below did not hear her. 'Yes, can't you remember when we were very little,' said the old seaman, 'and ran and played about? It was the very same court-yard where we now are, and we stuck slips in the ground, and made a garden' 'To be sure,' said he. 'And there in the corner stood a waterpail, where I used to swim my boats.'. ""I thought you were dead and gone, and lying down in the deep waters,"" she said. ""Many a night have I got up to see if the wind had not changed: and changed it had, sure enough."" ""I was so happy one day, when the rain was pouring down in torrents, the scavengers were before the house where I was in service"" ""I laughed and wept. I was so proud of you,"" she added. ""I had a different sort of sailing to that, later; and that, too, for many a year; a long way off, on great voyages."" ""We went to Friedericksberg, where the King and the Queen were sailing about in their splendid barges,"" he said.. ""I did not know it was you,"" he said. ""You arrived as soon as your letter, and you were so handsome"" ""You gave him a good box on his ear that made it tingle!"" he added. ""And then we married"" ""And I saw it all the while the rain was pouring down, and I standing there with the dust-box"" ""I was so dashing! Good heavens! What weather it was, and what a state the street was in!"". The story of a sailor and his wife is told by a friend. The couple were celebrating their fiftieth wedding anniversary. They were talking about their children and their grand-children. But they had forgotten the day of the anniversary. The Elderbush sent forth a strong odour in the sun, that was just about to set, and shone right in the old people's faces. It was the smell of the Elderbush, and it shone in their faces. They looked at each other and held one another by the hand. Soon after came their children, and theirgrand-children; for they knew well enough that it was the day. The old people had forgotten it, although they were able to remember all that had happened many years ago.. ""That was no fairy tale, 'tis true,"" said old Nanny. ""But now it's coming. The most wonderful fairy tales grow out of that which is reality"" ""My magnificent Elderbush could not have grown out of the tea-pot"" ""The thing is, you must understand it,"" said the narrator, ""let us ask old Nann."" ""And the youngest of the grandchildren danced around them, and called out quite delighted, that there was to be something very splendid that evening--they were all to have hot potatoes"" ""They both looked so rosy-cheeked,"" said a little boy. ""Old Nann nodded in the bush, and. Old Nanny had grown all of a sudden a young and pretty maiden. On her bosom she had a real Elderflower, and in her yellow waving hair a wreath of the flowers. Her eyes were so large and blue that it was a pleasure to look at them. She kissed the boy, and now they were of the same age and felt alike. The boy said, ""Huzza! Now we are riding miles off"" and they rode off on a horse. The horse was strong and handsome, and away they went at full gallop round the lawn. The little boy said: ""It's a beautiful day, and we are going to play in the garden."". The story is about a boy and a little girl. The boy is a boy, and the little girl is his Nanny. They are riding through the country. The little girl says, ""We are riding away to the castle where we were last year!"" The boy sees it all, and yet they were only going round the grass-plot. They were not going to the beautiful country-seat. But to the farm-house, the smithy, the church, the cock and the half-naked men banging with hammers. The story was not about that. It was about the boy and the girl.. The little girl wound her arms round the boy, and then they flew far away through all Denmark. Then they played in a side avenue, and marked out a little garden on the earth. They took Elder-blossoms from their hair, planted them, and they grew just like those the old people planted when they were children, as related before. And during their whole flight the Elder Tree smelt so sweet and odorous. The little girl always sang to him, ""This you will never forget."" The little maiden said, ""It is lovely here in spring!"" said the young maiden. The boy replied, ""Yes, it is lovely!"" and they went on their way together, until spring came, and summer, and autumn.. ""Oh, would it were always spring in the sweetly-smelling Danish beech-forests!"" said the little maiden. And she flew past old castles of by-gone days of chivalry, where the red walls and the embattled gables were mirrored in the canal. In the fields the corn was waving like the sea; in the ditches red and yellow flowers were growing; while wild-drone flowers, and blooming convolvuluses were creeping in the hedges. ""This one never forgets!"" she said. ""It is lovely here in autumn!"" said she. And suddenly the atmosphere grew as blue again as before.. ""It is delightful here in winter!"" said the little maiden. ""The dogs came leaping along, and whole flocks of wild-fowl flew over the cairn"" The sea was dark blue, covered with ships full of white sails. The young sang songs, but the old told fairy tales of mountain-sprites and soothsayers. The Christmas-tree was lighted in the room; presents were there, and good-humor reigned. ""Nothing could be more charming,"" said the maiden, ""and all the. ""It is really delightful here in winter!"" said the poorest child. ""The Elder Tree still was fragrant, and the red flag, with the white cross, was still waving"" ""The violin sounded in the room of the peasant""; the newly-baked cakes were attacked. The boy grew up to be a lad, and was to go forth in the wide world-far, far away to warm lands, where the coffee-tree grows. But at his departure the little maiden took an Elder-blossom from her bosom, and gave it to him to keep. When in foreign lands he opened the book, it was always at the place where the keepsake-flower lay, and the more he looked at it, the fresher it became. From among the leaves of the flowers he could distinctly see the little Maiden, peeping forth with her bright blue eyes. She whispered, ""It is delightful here in Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter""; and a hundred visions glided before his mind.. ""To-day is the fiftieth anniversary!"" said the little maiden. She took two flowers out of her hair, and kissed them. First, they shone like silver, then like gold; and when they laid them on the heads of the old people, each flower became a golden crown. So there they both sat, like a king and a queen, under the fragrant tree. The old man told his wife the story of ""Old Nanny,"" as it had been told him when a boy. And it seemed to both of them it contained much that resembled their own history; and those parts that were like it pleased them best. ""Some call me Old Nanny; others a 'Dryad,' but, in reality, my name is 'Remembrance' "". The little boy lay in his bed; he did not know if he had dreamed or not. The tea-pot was standing on the table, but no Elder Tree was growing out of it! And the old man, who had been talking, was just on the point of going out at the door, and he did go. There lay the Elder-blossom, as fresh as if it had been placed there but a short time before. Remembrance nodded, and the old people, decked with crowns of gold, sat in the flush of the evening sun. They closed their eyes, and--and--and --! Yes, that's the end of the story!. ""And where is old Nanny?"" asked the little boy. ""In the tea-pot,"" said his mother; ""and there she may remain"""
0.45,0.55,39.38265034592869,"Hans Christian Anderson published this cautionary tale in 1837, though its message resounds clearly today. The Emperor's New Clothes is about two poor and opportunistic weavers out to make a fool of a king and his entourage. Thankfully, not everyone buys-in. The story is about an Emperor who was so excessively fond of new clothes, that he spent all his money in dress.. The Emperor asked two pretended weavers to weave him clothes. The clothes would be invisible to everyone unfit for the office he held. The weavers set up two looms, and affected to work very busily, though in reality they did nothing at all. The Emperor then asked for the clothes to be woven for him immediately.. The Emperor wanted to know how the weavers were getting on with their cloth. The weavers asked for the most delicate silk and the purest gold thread. They put both into their own knapsacks and continued their pretended work at the empty looms until late at night.. The Emperor sent his faithful old minister to the weavers to see how the cloth looks. But he could not discover anything on the looms, for a very good reason, viz: there was nothing there. The impostors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come nearer their looms. They then asked him whether the design pleased him, and whether the colors were not very beautiful. But at the same time pointing to the empty frames.. ""Oh, it is excellent!"" replied the old minister, looking at the loom through his spectacles. ""This pattern, and the colors, yes, I will tell the Emperor without delay, how very beautiful I think them."" ""What!"" thought he again. ""Is it possible that I am a simpleton? I have never thought so myself."" ""You do not say whether the stuff pleases you,"" said one of the knaves.. The Emperor sent another officer of his court to see how the men were getting on, and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be ready. He surveyed the looms on all sides, but could see nothing at all but the empty frames. However, they put all that was given them into their knapsacks; and continued to work with as much apparent diligence as before at their empty looms. The Emperor was delighted with both colors and patterns.. The Emperor wanted to see the costly manufacture, while it was still in the loom. The weavers went on working more diligently than ever, but still did not pass a single thread through the looms. ""Indeed, please your Imperial Majesty,"" said he to his sovereign when he returned, ""the cloth which the weavers are preparing is extraordinarily magnificent"" ""How is this?"" said the Emperor to himself.. The Emperor looked closely at the empty looms. ""I can see nothing! This is indeed a terrible affair,"" he said. All his retinue strained their eyes, hoping to discover something on the looms, but they could see no more than the others. They all exclaimed, ""Oh, how beautiful!"" and advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from. The rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the procession was to take place. They pretended to roll the cloth off the looms; cut the air with their scissors; and sewed with needles without any thread in them. The. ""How splendid his Majesty looks in his new clothes, and how well they fit!"" everyone cried out. ""The Emperor's new clothes are ready!"" said the weavers. ""Here are your Majesty's trousers! Here is the scarf!"" ""The whole suit is as light as a cobweb,"" said the rogues. ""One might fancy one has nothing at all on, when dressed in it."" ""Yes indeed!"" said all the. ""I am quite ready,"" answered the Emperor. ""What a design! What colors. The Emperor's new clothes were so beautiful that no one would allow him to see them. If he had seen them, he would have declared himself either a simpleton or unfit for his office. The Emperor's clothes were also so beautiful, that no-one would allow them to be seen by him. He would then have to pretend to be carrying something.. ""But the Emperor has nothing at all on!"" said a little child. The Emperor was vexed, for he knew that the people were right. But he thought the procession must go on now! And the lords of the bedchamber took greater pains than ever."

""That I shall not tell you!"" said the garter, ""I will thank you not to speak to me"" ""I see well that you are both for use and ornament, my dear young lady,"" replied the collars.

And without more ado, she CUT HIM, and then he was condemned. ""All that I have is a fine gentleman, a boot-jack, and a hair-comb. If I only had the barony!"".

0.8099999999999999,0.9099999999999999,66.09250398724083,"The story of a young fir tree in the English countryside. The tree grew up to be a large fir tree. The story is told in the book ""The Fir Tree"" by William Makepeace Thackeray. The book is published by Hodder & Stoughton, Ltd. and is available in hardback and paperback. The first edition of the book is available now. The second edition is out now, and the third and fourth editions will be published in the spring of 2015 and the summer of 2015. The fifth and sixth volumes will be released in the autumn. The sixth and seventh volumes will come in the summer. The seventh and eighth volumes are expected to be released later in the year. The last volume will be the seventh, and will be dedicated to the memory of the young Fir.. The Tree was so large that the hare was obliged to go round it. ""To grow and grow, to get older and be tall,"" thought the Tree. ""That, after all, is the most delightful thing in the world!"" The Tree thought that if he grew tall, he would be able to look into the wide world. He thought that this would make him happy. But he was not so happy about the sunbeams, nor the birds, or the red clouds that sailed above him. The Tree was not happy about this either, but he decided to grow taller. He grew a tall tree.. The Fir-tree trembled at the sight of great trees being cut down. He asked the Swallows and the Storks where they had been taken. The Stork said he had met many ships with magnificent masts. The Swallows did not know anything about it, but the Stork nodded his head. The Tree asked them where the ships were, and they said they smelt so of fir. The tree asked where they were taken, and was told they had gone to Egypt. The trees were taken to the sea, where they lived on ships with smelt of fir, and were never seen again.. ""Rejoice in thy vigorous growth, and in the fresh life that moveth within thee!"" said the Sun to the Fir. The Fir replied: ""I am happy to be alive, but I am not happy to die."" The Sun said: ""That would take a long time, and I am sure you would like to live."" The Fir added: ""But I am happy that I am alive, and that I can live."" And the Sun said, ""I'm happy to have you, too. I'm glad that you are alive. I love you. I want to see you again."" The sun said: 'I will come back and see you soon. I will come. The Fir-tree asks: ""Why do they retain all their branches? Whither are they taken?"" The Sparrows reply: ""We have peeped in at the windows in the town below! We know whither they are taken!"" The Tree rejoices: ""That is still better than to cross the sea! What a longing do I suffer! Were Christmas but come! I am now tall, and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year!"" The Fir- tree asks: 'And then? What happens then?' The Sparrow's reply: 'We did not see anything more: it was incomparably beautiful' The Tree replies: 'I would fain know if I am destined for so glorious a career'. ""Rejoice in our presence!"" said the Air and the Sunlight; ""rejoice in thy own fresh youth!"" But the Tree did not rejoice at all; he grew and grew, and was green both winter and summer. People that saw him said, ""What a fine tree!"" and toward Christmas he was one of the first that was cut down. The axe struck deep into the very pith; the tree fell to the earth with a sigh: he felt a pang—it was like a swoon; he could not think of happiness, for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home, from the place where he had sprung up.. The Fir-tree was put in a cask that was filled with sand. He knew well that he should never see his dear old comrades, the little bushes and flowers around him, any more; perhaps not even the birds! The departure was not at all agreeable. The servants, as well as the young ladies, decorated it. Oh, how the Tree quivered! What was to happen? The servants and young ladies decorated it, and it stood on a large gayly coloured carpet. And the Fir- tree was stuck upright in a Cask that is filled with Sand. But no one could see that it was a casks, for green cloth was hung all around it,  and it stands on aLarge gayly colours carpet. There, too, were large easy chairs, silken sofas, large tables full of. On one branch there hung little nets cut out of coloured paper, and each net was filled with sugar-plums. Among the other boughs gilded apples and walnuts were suspended, looking as though they had grown there. Dolls that looked for all the world like men—the Tree had never beheld such before.. ""Oh,"" thought the Tree, ""if the evening were but come! If the tapers were but lighted! And then I wonder what will happen! Perhaps the other trees from the forest will come to look at me!"" ""Help! Help!"" cried the young ladies, and they quickly put out the fire. It was really splendid—beyond description splendid!"" ""I wonder if I shall take root here, and winter and summer stand covered with ornaments!"" said the Tree. ""This with trees is the same thing as a headache with us. It is so impatient"" ""It is a tree that knows very much about the matter! but he was so impatient that for sheer longing. The Tree was so uneasy lest he should lose something of his splendour, that he was quite bewildered amidst the glare and brightness. When suddenly both folding-doors opened, and a troop of children rushed in as if they would upset the Tree. But it was only for a moment; then they shouted so that the whole place reechoed with their rejoicing. They danced round the tree, and one present after the other was pulled off. And the lights burned down to the very branches, and as they burned down they were put out, one after theother.. The children fell upon the Tree with such violence that all its branches cracked. If it had not been fixed firmly in the cask, it would certainly have tumbled down. ""Ivedy-Avedy!"" cried some; ""Klumpy-Dumpy"" cried the others. But I shall tell only one story. Now which will you have: that about Ivedy, or about Klumpy, who tumbled downstairs, and yet after all came to the throne and married the princess? The children asked. ""Which will you tell?"" ""I will tell you one story,"" replied the little fat man.. The Fir-tree alone was silent as the man told the story of Klumpy-Dumpy. The Fir- tree believed it all, because the man was so good-looking. The children clapped their hands, and cried out, ""Oh, go on! Do go on!"" They wanted to hear about Ivedy-Avedy, too, but the little man only told them about Klumpy-Dumps. The birds in the woods had never related the like of this. ""Klumpy- Dumpy fell downstairs, and yet he married the princess! Yes! Yes!"" thought the Fir-Tree.. ""I won't tremble to-morrow,"" thought the Fir-tree. ""I will enjoy to the full all my splendour"" ""Well, well! who knows, perhaps I may fall downstairs, too, and get a princess as wife!"" And the whole night the Tree stood still and in deep thought. In the morning the servant and the housemaid came in. They dragged him out of the room, and up the stairs into the loft. And here in a dark corner, where no daylight could enter, they left him. ""What am I to do here? What shall I hear now, I wonder?"" he asked.. The Fir-tree thought he had been entirely forgotten. He reflected on his lonely life. A Mouse came to visit him, and sniffed about the branches. The Tree thought it was dreadfully cold. He was put up under shelter till the springtime comes. The Mouse said it was very cold, and that he had not seen a hare in a long time. He said he had seen no hare, and no one else in the whole of the woods. The Fir- tree thought he was very lonely. He thought he would be put up in a corner. But he was put under shelter until the spring. The Spring came. It was a very cold winter. The snow was very heavy, and there was no room for the Tree. The Snow was very thick.. ""I am by no means old,"" said the Fir-tree. ""There's many a one considerably older than I am."" ""Where do you come from,"" asked the Mice; ""and what can you do?"" They were so extremely curious. ""Tell us about the most beautiful spot on the earth,"" they asked. ""I know no such place,"" said he, ""but I know the woods, where the sun shines, and where the little birds sing."" And then he told all about his youth. And the little Mice had never heard the like before; and they listened and said: ""Well, to be sure! How much you have seen! How happy you must have been!"". ""I am in my prime, and am only rather short for my age,"" said the Fir. ""Yes, in reality those were happy times,"" he said. ""But they may still come,"" he added. ""I have a friend who fell down and got a princess."" ""Yes,"" said he. ""That would be a real charming princess"" ""Yes. That would be wonderful."" ""I've got a friend that fell down, and he got a girl."" ""And I've got another friend who falls down and gets a girl"" ""And that would be lovely"" ""Oh, yes,"" he replied. ""It would be great."". The Fir-tree told the whole fairy tale, for he could remember every single word of it. The little Mice jumped for joy up to the very top of the Tree. Next night two more Mice came, and on Sunday two Rats, even; but they said the stories were not interesting, which vexed the little MICE. The Tree sighed: ""After all, it was very pleasant when the sleeklittle Mice sat around me and listened to what I told them."" Now that too is over. The Fir- tree is a very happy tree, but he is not so very amusing either. He is a little bit sad, but not so much that he is sad.. The Fir-tree was pulled out of the loft and thrown down on the floor. He felt the fresh air, the first sunbeam, and now he was out in the courtyard. The court adjoined a garden, and all was in flower, but it was not the Fir- tree that they meant. The Tree spread out his branches, but, alas! they were all withered and yellow. But I will take good care to enjoy myself when I am brought out again. The Fir-Tree was brought out by a quantity of people and set to work in the loft. The trunks were moved, the Tree was thrown down, but a man drew him toward the stairs, where the daylight shone.. The Tree was in a corner among weeds and nettles. The golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the Tree, and glittered in the sunshine. The Tree beheld all the beauty of the flowers, and the freshness in the garden. He thought of his first youth in the woods, of the merry Christmas Eve, and of the little Mice who had listened with so much pleasure to the story of Klumpy-Dumpy. He wished he had remained in his dark corner in the loft, and had remained with his friends in the Woods. He would not have been able to bear the pain of losing the golden star.. The Tree was chopped into small pieces by the gardener's boy. ""Had I but rejoiced when I had reason to do so! But now 'tis past, 'is past!"" The boys played about in the court, and the youngest wore the gold star on his breast. The Tree had had on the happiest evening of his life. However, that was over now—the Tree gone, the story at an end. All, all was"

But as to where the Garden of Paradise was to be found, not a word could he discover. His grandmother had told him, when he was quite a little fellow and was about to begin his school life, that every flower was a delicious cake, and that the pistils were full of wine. In one flower history was written, in another geography or tables; you had only to eat the cake and you knew the lesson. The more you ate, the more history. The Prince of Wales was a young boy when he first heard of the Garden of Paradise. He believed in the delights of the paradise, but as he grew older he realised that the real delights must be far beyond this. The Prince was left with no dry thread on him when he died in a tragic accident. He was found dead in the woods, covered in blood and covered in mud. He had been playing in the wood with a friend when the accident happened. The story of his death was told in a book called 'The Prince and the Woods' by the Prince's father, the King of Wales, and is now being translated into English. The book is published by Oxford University Press and is available in paperback.. The Prince was in a cave when he was told he was in the 'c cavern of the winds' An oldish woman, tall and strong enough to be a man dressed up, sat by the fire throwing on logs from time to time. She told him that he was there to dry his clothes, and that he should sit down by the flames. The Prince was almost fainting, but then he heard murmuring and saw a stag being roasted. 'It will be worse than this when my sons come home!' said the woman. 'My sons are the four winds of the world! Do you understand?'. The Northwind came in with an icy blast. He was dressed in bearskin trousers and jacket, and he had a sealskin cap drawn over his ears. 'My sons do as they like; they are playing rounders now with the clouds up there in the great hall,' and she pointed up into the sky. 'Oh indeed!' said the Prince. 'You seem to speak very harshly, and you are not so gentle as the women I generally see about me!' 'Oh, I daresay they have nothing else to do! I have to be harsh if I am to keep my boys under control! But I can do it, although they are a stiff-necked lot! Do you see those four sacks hanging on the wall? They are just as frightened of them as you used. The Northwind told them where he came from, and where he had been for the last month. Long icicles were hanging from his beard, and one hailstone after another dropped down from the collar of his jacket. 'I come from the Arctic seas,' he said, 'I have been on Behring Island with the Russian walrus-hunters. I sat at the helm and slept when they sailed from the north cape, and when I woke now and then the stormy petrels were flying about my legs' 'Don't go straight to the fire,' said the Prince. 'You might easily get. 'Pray don't be too long-winded,' said the mother of the winds. 'So at last you got to Behring Island!' 'It's perfectly splendid! There you have a floor to dance upon, as flat as a pancake, half-thawed snow, with moss' 'There were bones of whales and Polar bears lying about; they looked like the legs and arms of giants covered with green mould' 'I gave a little puff to the fog so that one could see the shed. It was a house built of wreckage and covered with the skins of whales' 'Then I blew down thousands of their throats and they learnt to shut their mouths'. 'You're a good story-teller, my boy!' said his mother. 'It makes my mouth water to hear you!' Then there was a hunt! The harpoons were plunged into the walruses' breasts, and the steaming blood spurted out of them like fountains over the ice. Then I remembered my part of the game! I blew up and made my ships, the mountain-high icebergs, nip the boats; whew! how they whistled and how they screamed, but I whistled louder!'. 'Is that the little Zephyr?' asked the Prince. 'Yes, certainly it is, but he is not so little as all that' 'From the forest wildernesses!' he said, 'where the thorny creepers make a fence between every tree, where the water-snake lies in the wet grass, and where human beings seem to be superfluous!' 'But here we have my brother from the west; I like him best of all; he smells of the sea and brings a splendid cool breeze with him!' 'He used to be a pretty boy once, but that's gone by!' said the Prince, 'but here we. 'I have been turning somersaults in the Savannahs, patting the wild horse, and shaking down cocoanuts! Oh yes, I have plenty of stories to tell! But one need not tell everything,' he said. 'I saw the wild buffalo swimming in the river, but the stream carried him away; he floated with the wild duck, which soared into the sky at. The Southwind appeared now in a turban and a flowing bedouin's cloak. 'It is fearfully cold in here,' he said, throwing wood on the fire; 'it is easy to see that the Northwind got here first!' The Northwind replied: 'It's hot enough here to roast a polar bear' The Southwind then kissed his mother so heartily that she nearly fell backwards; he was indeed a wild boy. He then said: 'I have been chasing the lion with the Hottentots in Kaffirland! What grass there is on those plains! as green as an olive!'. 'There were no limits to the outstretched desert,' says the author. 'I met a caravan! They were killing their last camel to get water to drink, but it wasn't much they got' 'You should have seen how despondently the dromedaries stood, and the merchant drew his caftan over his head' 'Then you have only been doing harm!' said the mother of the caravan. 'Then I blow it away, sometime the sun will bleach their bones, and then travellers will see that people have been there before. 'Your sons are lively fellows!' said the Prince. 'Into the bag you go!' And before he knew where he was she had the Southwind by the waist and in the bag; it rolled about on the ground, but she sat down upon it and then it had to be quiet. 'Yes, indeed,' she said; 'but I can master them! Here comes the fourth.' It was the Eastwind, and he was dressed like a Chinaman. 'Oh, have you come from that quarter?' said the mother. 'I thought you had been in the Garden of Paradise.'. 'You're quite uproarious about it!' said the old woman. 'It's a good thing you are going to the Garden of Paradise to-morrow' 'Drink deep of the well of wisdom, and bring a little bottleful home to me' 'That I will,' said the Eastwind, 'But why have you put my brother from the south into the bag?' 'He must tell me about the phoenix'. 'Here is a palm leaf for the Princess!' said the Southwind. 'The old phoenix, the only one in the world, gave it to me. He has scratched his whole history on it with his bill, for the hundred years of his life, and she can read it for herself' 'Open the bag! then you'll be my sweetest mother, and I'll give you two pockets full of tea as green and fresh as when I picked it!' she said. 'For the sake of the tea, and because you are my darling, I will open my bag!' she replied. 'I saw how the phoenix set fire to his nest himself and sat on it while it burnt, like the widow of a Hindoo!'. The Prince and the Eastwind became good friends. The Prince asked the winds where the Garden of Paradise was. The Eastwind told him that no human being had been there since Adam and Eve's time. The queen of the fairies lives there. The Island of Bliss, where death never enters, and where living is a delight, is there. 'If that is where you want to go you must fly with me to-morrow,' said the East winds. 'I suppose you know all about them I suppose from your Bible stories?' said the Prince. 'Of course,' said he. 'The Garden of Eden sank into the ground, but it kept its warm sunshine, its. The Prince was taken on a journey by the Eastwind. He was so high up that woods and fields, rivers and lakes, looked like a large coloured map. He called the fields and meadows 'the green board' The Eastwind took the Prince to his home in the north of the country. The Prince fell asleep on his back and woke up in the early hours of the morning. He said he would take the Prince with him to the North Pole. The East winds said they would take him there in the next few days. They left the Prince on the back of their Eastwind and flew away.. 'Now you can see the Himalayas!' said the Eastwind. 'They are the highest mountains in Asia; we shall soon reach the Garden of Paradise' They took a more southerly direction, and the air became scented with spices and flowers. Figs and pomegranates grew wild. The wild vines were covered with blue and green grapes. The Kossack on his little horse sped fast over the plains, but the Prince sped faster still. The Eastwind told him he had better leave off and hold tight, or he might fall and find himself hanging on to a church steeple. The Prince clapped his hands, but he was told to hold tight.. 'Are we in the Garden of Paradise now?' asked the Prince. 'No, certainly not!' answered the Eastwind. 'But we shall soon be there. Do you see that wall of rock and the great cavern where the wild vine hangs like a big curtain? We have to go through there! Wrap yourself up in your cloak, the sun is burning here, but a step further on it is icy cold' The bird which flies past the cavern has one wing out here in the heat of summer, and the other is there in the cold of winter.. 'We seem to be journeying along Death's road to the Garden of Paradise!' said the Prince. The Eastwind spread his wings, and they shone like the brightest flame. But what a cave it was! Large blocks of stone, from which the water dripped, hung over them. It looked like a chapel of the dead, with mute organ pipes and petrified banners. A river ran there as clear as the air itself, and the fish in it were like gold and silver. The air was also deliciously soft, as fresh as on the mountain-tops and as scented as down among the roses in the valley.. The Eastwind took the Prince in his arms and bore him over. Purple eels, which gave out blue sparks with every curve, gambolled about in the water. The most wonderful climbing plants hung in wreaths. It was the most extraordinary combination of birds, flowers and scrolls. The flowers and leaves there sang all the beautiful old songs of his childhood, but sang them more wonderfully than any human voice could sing them. The Prince had never seen such rich and mighty trees. The Island of Bliss, where the Garden of Paradise bloomed. The Eastwind, the Eastwind and the East Wind, the Westwind and The Westwind, all sang to the Prince. He was taken over by the East winds and bore over to the Island of bliss.. The Prince saw that they were not birds but plants. Lions and tigers sprang like agile cats among the green hedges. The Fairy of the Garden now advanced to meet them. She was young and very beautiful, and was surrounded by a band of lovely girls, each with a gleaming star in her hair. She took the Prince's hand and led him into her palace. The walls were the colour of the brightest tulips in the sunlight. The ceiling was one great shining flower, and the longer one gazed into it the deeper the calyx seemed to be. The Prince's eyes sparkled with delight. The longer he gazed into the ceiling the deeper it became. The prince's eyes were filled with tears.. The Prince went to the window, and looking through one of the panes saw the Tree of Knowledge, with the Serpent, and Adam and Eve standing by. The Fairy explained that Time had burned a picture into each pane, but not of the kind one usually sees. All that had ever happened in this world lived and moved on these window panes; only Time could imprint such wonderful pictures. The Prince then went into a large, lofty room, the walls of which were like transparent paintings of faces, one more beautiful than the other. These were millions of the Blessed who smiled and sang, and all their songs melted into one perfect melody. The highest ones were so tiny that they seemed smaller than the very smallest rosebud, no bigger than a pinpoint in a. 'Now let us get into the boat,' said the Fairy. 'We shall find refreshment on the swelling waters' 'The boat rocks, but it does not move from the spot' 'All the countries of the world will pass before our eyes' 'It was a curious sight to see the whole coast move' 'This was New Holland' 'They heard the song of priests, and saw the dances of the savages to the sound of drums and pipes of bone' 'We will find the answers to all your questions' 'What will you do with your life?' 'What do you want to do with it?' 'I don't know.' 'What would you like to do?' 'Do you have a question for me?' 'Yes, I would like to know'. The Prince was so happy, and he saw a hundred times more than we have described. The pyramids of Egypt reaching to the clouds, with fallen columns, and Sphynxes half buried in sand, next sailed past them. Then came the Aurora Borealis blazing over the peaks of the north; they were fireworks which could not be imitated. The Prince asked: 'Can I stay here always?' 'That depends upon yourself,' answered the Fairy. 'If you do not, like Adam, allow yourself to be tempted to do what is forbidden, you can stay hereAlways' 'I will not touch the apples on the Tree of Knowledge,' said the Prince. 'There are thousands of other fruits here as beautiful' '. 'I will remain here!' said the Prince. 'Be strong, then we shall meet again in a hundred years. Farewell! Farewell!' And the Eastwind spread his great wings; they shone like poppies at the harvest time, or the Northern Lights in a cold winter. 'Good-bye! good-bye!' whispered the flowers. 'Sorrow and labour will be your lot' 'I will stay here!' the Prince said. 'With every step you take your longing will grow stronger. Do not come with me!'. The Fairy led the way through a field of white lilies. The lilies sang of the joy of living. The Fairy said, 'Remember my warning. Every time you resist, you will grow stronger' The Fairy told the lilies, 'I will never leave you again. You will always be with me' The lily-draped field was then filled with white flowers. The flowers were then blown away by the wind. The sun set over the fields. The Prince said, ""I will not leave you now. I will never again leave you behind."" The Prince then said,  ""I am leaving you now, and I will not come back."". The Fairy beckoned to him and said so tenderly, 'Come with me,' that he rushed towards her. He felt such joy as he had never known before. The fragrance in the scented air around grew stronger, the harps sounded sweeter than ever. It seemed as if the millions of smiling heads in the hall where the Tree grew nodded and sang, 'One must know everything' The song proceeding from it was soft and lovely, like his mother's voice, and. The Fairy dropped her shimmering garment, drew back the branches, and a moment after was hidden within their depths. There she lay asleep already, beautiful as only the Fairy in the Garden of Paradise can be. She smiled in her dreams; he bent over her and saw the tears welling up under her eyelashes. 'Do you weep for me?' he whispered. 'Weep not, beautiful maiden. I only now understand the full bliss of Paradise; it surges through my blood and through my thoughts' 'I have not sinned yet!' said the Prince, 'nor will I'; then he drew back back the branch.. The Prince of Persia was killed by a thunderous earthquake. He was buried in a cave in the woods. The Prince was found by the mother of the winds. He said: 'I have sinned like Adam, sinned so heavily that Paradise has sunk low beneath the earth' He was found in the wood near the cave of the wind. He had been buried in the forest. He has now been found in a new place. He is alive and well. He says: 'If it were to be everlasting night to me, a moment like this were worth it' He has been found by a beautiful Fairy. He will return to his homeland. He wants to be with her again. But she has left him.. 'Ah, he shall soon go there!' said Death. 'He shall be laid in a coffin, but not now' 'I only mark him and then leave him for a time to wander about on the earth to expiate his sin and to grow better' 'If his thoughts are wicked and his heart still full of sin, he will sink deeper in his coffin than Paradise sank,' she said. 'I shall only go once in every thousand years to see if he is to sink deeper or to rise to the stars, the twinkling stars up there' 'So soon as the first evening!' she said, 'I thought as much; if you were my boy, you should go into the bag!'"
0.45,0.55,39.433371767418876,"A party in Copenhagen was held to celebrate the opening of the new market. The conversation turned to the middle ages, which some maintained were more full of interest than our own times. The party was held at a house near the king's new market in Copenhagen. The author was invited to a party at the house of a friend of the host.. The counsellor considered the times of the Danish king, Hans,1 as the noblest and happiest. The younger was not Fortune herself, but the chambermaid of one of Fortunes attendants. The elder one, who was named Care, looked rather gloomy; she always goes about to perform her own business in person. They were telling each other where they had been during the day. The conversation was only interrupted by the arrival of a newspaper, which did not, however, contain much. The messenger of Fortune had only transacted a few unimportant matters. But she had something extraordinary to relate, after all. To-day is my birthday; and in honor of it I have been intrusted with a pair of goloshes, to introduce amongst mankind. These goloshe have the property of making every one who puts them on imagine himself in any place he wishes, or that he exists at any period. Counsellor Knapp put on the goloshes of Fortune instead of his own. He was at once carried back three hundred years, to the times of King Hans. He immediately set his foot into the mud and mire of the street, which in those days possessed no pavement. The moon had not yet risen high enough to penetrate the thick foggy air, and all the objects around him were confused together in the darkness.. The counsellor saw a strange procession pass before him. The principal person in the procession was a clerical-looking gentleman. At the nearest corner, a lamp hung before a picture of the Madonna. The light it gave was almost useless, for he only perceived it when he came quite close and his eyes fell on the painted figures of the Mother and Child.. The counsellor was walking through East Street and over Highbridge Place. He saw a bank and some shallow water, and two people, who sat in a boat. He asked them where the bridge was, and they told him to go to Christians Haven, in Little Turf Street. The man was the bishop of Zealand. The astonished counseller asked what it all meant, and who the gentleman might be.. The author was looking for a coach to take him to the new market in Christians Haven. He could not find the bridge nor any railings. The moon burst forth from a cloud as he passed through the East gate. He was forced to go back to the kings new market, where there are plenty of carriages standing. He found nothing but an open meadow, surrounded by a few bushes, through which ran a broad canal or stream. The more he talked with the boatmen the less they could understand each other.. The counsellor turned back in the full conviction that he must be ill. He examined the houses more closely; he found that most of them were built of lath and plaster, and many had only a thatched roof. A few miserable-looking wooden booths, for the accommodation of Dutch watermen, stood on the opposite shore. He looked for the house, but it was not in existence.. The counsellor was taken to a tavern in Copenhagen. The landlady spoke to him in German. He supposed from this that she did not understand Danish. He asked her to send for a fly to take him to Christians Haven. The fly came and took him to the agents' house. The counsellors' house was in Christians Haven, in the centre of Copenhagen. It was a tavern of the olden times. The room had the appearance of a Dutch interior.. The counsellor's singular dress convinced the woman that he was a foreigner. She soon understood, however, that he did not find himself quite well, and therefore brought him a mug of water. It had something of the taste of seawater, certainly, although it had been drawn from the well outside. Then the counselor leaned his head on his hand, drew a deep breath, and pondered over all the strange. A man was talking to a counsellor. He said that he was a Bachelor of Divinity. The man then explained that the northern lights were caused by electricity. The counsellors looked at him in great astonishment, and said he must be a very learned man.. The king likes especially the romance of Messeurs Iffven and Gaudian, which describes King Arthur and his knights of the round table. He has joked about it with the gentlemen of his Court. The title agreed with the dress. It was a perfect original, such as one meets with sometimes even in Jutland. It is a story of a village schoolmaster, an old schoolmaster.. The book is published by Heiberg, but the publisher is Godfred von Gehman. The book was published by a scholar. The author was asked about the name of the publisher, and was told that it was not Heibergs. The scholar then said that Godfred was the first publisher in Denmark, and that he was the publisher of the book. The conversation went on for some time, until the scholar realised that the book was in fact published by the scholar.. The counsellor had forgotten all that had happened previously. He had to drink with them, for they overpowered the good man with their politeness. They stared at each other, and when it became worse the bachelor spoke in Latin, in the hope of being better understood; but it was all useless. They poured out the wine, bowed their heads, and withdrew.. The counsellor saw quite plainly a lamp, and a large building behind it. He was in East Street, as it now appears. He lay with his legs turned towards a porch, and just by him sat the watchman asleep. Is it possible that I have been lying here in the street dreaming? said he. He became at last desperate; and when one of them said he was tipsy, he did not doubt the mans word in the leastonly begged them to get a drosch. Two minutes afterwards he sat in a droschky, which was to drive him to Christians Haven. He thought of all the terror and anxiety which he had undergone, and felt thankful from his heart for the reality and comfort of modern times. It is quite shocking that one glass of punch should have upset me like this, he thought. He felt thankful for modern times, which, with all their errors, were far better than those in which he so lately found himself.. A poem written by the lieutenant himself. A lieutenant in love, and poor. This is a triangle, or more properly speaking, the half of the broken die of fortune. The lieutenant felt this very keenly, and therefore leaned his head against the window-frame, and sighed deeply. The poor watchman in the street, said he, is far happier than I am. He knows not what I call poverty. He has a home, a wife and children, who weep at his sorrow.. The watchman again became a watchman. He had preferred his former condition. He missed his wife and the little ones, who are always ready to smother me with kisses. He still had the goloshes on his feet. A falling star gleamed across the sky. There goes one! cried he. However, there are quite enough left; I should very much like to examine these a little nearer, especially the moon. The student, for whom my wife washes, says that when we die we shall fly from one star to another.. ""I would willingly let my body lie here on the steps"" ""I wish I could make a little spring up there now"" ""If that were true, it would be very delightful, but I dont believe it"" ""Now we shall hear what happened to the watchman"" ""There are certain things in the world which should be uttered very cautiously"" ""We are all in this together, and we are not going to be separated from each other"". The moon is formed of a lighter material than our earth, and may be said to be as soft as new fallen snow. The interior had the appearance of a large hollow, bowl-shaped, with a depth about half a mile from the brim. Within this hollow stood a large town; we may form some idea of its appearance by pouring the white of an egg into a glass of water. The materials of which it was built seemed just as soft, and pictured forth cloudy turrets and sail-like terraces.. The watchman understood very well the language of the inhabitants of the moon. They were disputing about our earth, and doubted whether it could be inhabited. Do we not, in our dreams, show a wonderful dramatic talent? each of our acquaintance appears to us then in his own character, and with his own voice; no man could thus imitate them in his waking hours. How clearly, too, we are reminded of persons whom we have not seen for many years; they start up suddenly to the minds eye with all their peculiarities as living realities.. The watchman's staff fell out of his hand, and his eyes stared at the moon, about which his honest soul was wandering. The body fell forward, and lay at full length on the ground as one dead. All his comrades were very much frightened, for he seemed quite dead. Still they allowed him to remain after they had given notice of what had happened. At dawn the body was carried to the hospital. We might imagine it to be no jesting matter if the soul of the man should chance to return to him, for. The soul, when acting upon its own impulses, is wiser than we are. It is the body that makes it stupid. We might fancy the soul inquiring of the police, or at the address office, or among the missing parcels, and then at length finding it at the hospital. But we may comfort ourselves by the certainty that the soul is smarter than us.. The same day he was allowed to leave, but the goloshes remained at the hospital. One of the young volunteers, of whom, physically speaking, it might be said that he had a great head, was on guard that evening at Fredericks Hospital. The most difficult part of the body to get through was the head; and in this case, as it often happens in the world, the small heads were the most fortunate. The story is about a man who tried to squeeze through the iron railings of a railway station. He was too fat and his head was too large to fit through the railings, but the goloshes of Fortune would fit his body. The man was unable to get his body through the palings. He then tried to pull his head back again, but without success. His first feeling was one of anger, and then his spirits sank below zero.. The goloshes of Fortune had placed him in this terrible position, and unfortunately it never occurred to him to wish himself free. No, instead of wishing he kept twisting about, yet did not stir from the spot. The rain poured, and not a creature could be seen in the street. The porters bell he was unable to reach, and however was he to get loose! He foresaw that he should have to stay there till morning, and then they must send for a smith to file away the iron bars, and that would be a work of time.. The goloshes were of great service to him. The night passed, and the whole of the following day; but no one sent for the golosches. In the evening a declamatory performance was to take place at the amateur theatre in a distant street. The house was crowded; among the audience was the young volunteer from the hospital. He had on the golohes; they had not been sent for, and as the streets were still very dirty, they were ofgreat service to he.. The volunteer shrunk up together, and commenced a most unusual journey through the hearts of the spectators in the first row. He imagined what he should see in the whole row of ladies and gentlemen on the first seat, if he could only look into their hearts. I dare say from many I should hear the words, Please to walk in. I only wish I could slip into the hearts like a little tiny thought.. The author visited the hearts of two women. The first was that of a lady, but he thought he must have got into one of the rooms of an orthopedic institution where plaster casts of deformed limbs were hanging on the walls. The next heart was also a sanctuary, which he felt almost unworthy to enter; it represented a mean garret, but the warm sunshine streamed through the window, lovely roses bloomed in a little flowerbox on the roof, two blue birds sang of childlike joys.. The volunteer entered the heart of a man who was said to be a man of intellect and heart. He then entered the wife of a young officer, who wore several orders. He also entered a pigeon-house and a cabinet of mirrors. The volunteer came out of the last heart in the row quite bewildered. He thought he must have got into a narrow needlecase, full of sharp needles. But such was not the fact; it belonged to a young Officer.. The volunteer had a strange fit in a Russian bath. He was still in his evening costume, with his boots and goloshes on, and the hot drops from the ceiling falling on his face. The attendant stopped him with a loud cry, when he saw a man with all his clothes on. The volunteer had, however, presence of mind enough to whisper, It is for a wager; but the first thing he did, when his own room, was to put a large blister on his neck, and another on his back, that his crazy fit might be cu"

The great white snails which persons of quality in former times made fricassees of, ate, and said, ""Hem, hem! how delicious!"" for they thought it tasted so delicate. The burdock never grows alone, but where there grows one there always grow several.. The two last venerable old snails were boiled and placed on a silver dish. They knew not how old they were, but they could remember very well that there had been many more. They were of a family from foreign lands, and that for them and theirs the whole forest was planted. They had never been outside it, but knew that there was still something more. ""There is nothing at all,"" said Father Snail. ""No place can be better than ours, and I have nothing to wish for!"" ""I would willingly go to the manorhouse, be boiled, and laid on a silver dish,"" said the dame. ""I should like to know how far it extends, and what there is outside!"". ""You must not scold him,"" said Mother Snail. ""He creeps so carefully; he will afford us much pleasure--and we have nothing but him to live for!"" ""I know one, sure enough--the most charming one!"" said one of the ants. ""They certainly know of a wife for our little snail!"" said the old one. ""Black snails without a house--but they are so common, and so conceited. ""We have a wife for him,"" said the gnats. ""At a hundred human paces from here there sits a little snail in her house, on a gooseberry bush; she is quite lonely, and old enough to be married!"" ""Has she a house?"" said the ant. ""She has a palace!"" said the ants. ""The finest ant's palace, with seven. The marriage was celebrated. Six earth-worms shone as well as they could. The old folks could not bear noise and merriment; but old Dame Snail made a brilliant speech. After this speech the old ones crept into their shells, and never more came out. It was a whole week before she arrived; but therein was the very best of it.. The young couple governed in the forest, and had a numerous progeny, but they were never boiled, and never came on the silver dishes. They concluded that the manor-house had fallen to ruins, and that all the men in the world"
0.46,0.56,40.683229813664596,"The Ephemera, the flies that exist for only a day, had fluttered about the old oak, enjoyed life and felt happy. If, for a moment, one of the tiny creatures rested on one of his large fresh leaves, the tree would always say, “Poor little creature! your whole life consists only of a single day. How very short. It must be quite melancholy.” Winter is its time for rest; its night after the long day of spring, summer. “Everything around me is so wonderfully bright and warm, and beautiful, that it makes me joyous.” “But only for one day, and then it is all over.’ “What is the meaning of all over. The tree said to the fly, ""We have the same time to live; only we reckon differently"" The fly danced and floated in the air, rejoicing in her delicate wings of gauze and velvet. The fragrance of clover-fields and wild roses, elder-blossoms and honeysuckle, from the garden hedges, wild thyme, primroses, and mint, was so strong that the perfume almost intoxicated the little fly. The oak remained awake through the morning of spring, the noon of summer, and the evening of autumn. The same thing was continued through many generations of Ephemera. All of them felt equally merry and equally happy. But as winter drew nigh, its time of rest, its night was coming. Already the storms were singing, “Good-night, good-night.”. The great tree had once been small; indeed, in its cradle it had been an acorn. According to human computation, it was now in the fourth century of its existence. Its summit towered above all the other trees, and could be seen far out at sea. In its topmost branches the wood-pigeon built her nest, and the cuckoo carried out his usual vocal performances. But now it was winter, the tree stood leafless, so that every one could see how crooked and bent were the branches.. The tree dreamed a dream just about holy Christmas time. He saw the knights of olden times and noble ladies ride by through the wood on their gallant steeds. The hunting horn sounded, and the dogs barked. Crows and rooks came by turns and sat on them, and talked of the hard times which were beginning, and how difficult it was in winter to obtain food. The tree had, doubtless, a kind of a feeling that the festive time had arrived.. The watchfires again blazed, and men sang and slept under the hospitable shelter of the tree. He saw hostile warriors, in colored dresses and glittering armor, with spear and halberd, pitching their tents, and anon striking them. The tree felt itself stretching and spreading out, while through the root beneath the earth ran the warm vigor of life. Then it seemed as if new life was thrilling through every fibre of root and stem and leaf. The tree grew higher and still higher, with increased strength, his topmost boughs became broader and fuller. The stars became visible in broad daylight, large and sparkling, like clear and gentle eyes. These were wonderful and happy moments for the old tree, full of peace and joy. Yet, amidst all this happiness, the tree felt a yearning, longing desire that all the other trees, bushes, herbs, and flowers beneath him, might be able also to rise higher, as he had done, and. The grand, majestic oak could not be quite happy in the midst of his enjoyment, while all the rest, both great and small, were not with him. And this feeling of yearning trembled through every branch, through every leaf, as warmly and fervently as if they had been the fibres of a human heart. The summit of the tree waved to and fro, and bent downwards as if in his silent longing he sought for something. Then there came to him the fragrance of thyme, followed by the more powerful scent of honeysuckle and v. On a blade of grass, that fluttered in. “Here we are, we are here,” sounded in voice and song. May beetles hummed, the bees murmured, the birds sang, each in his own way. The air was filled with the sounds of song and gladness. “Why this is beautiful, too beautiful to be believed,’ said the oak in a joyful tone.. The old tree, as it still grew upwards and onwards, felt that his roots were loosening themselves from the earth. “I have them all here, both great and small; not one has been forgotten. Can such happiness be imagined?” It seemed almost impossible.“In heaven with the Eternal God, it can be imagined, and it is possible,” sounded the reply through the air. The root was torn from the ground just at the moment when in his dream he fanc. The storm had ceased when the sun rose on Christmas-day. From all the churches sounded the festive bells, and from every hearth, even of the smallest hut, rose the smoke into the blue sky. The sea gradually became calm, and on board a great ship that had withstood the tempest during the night,. The story opens with an old oak tree expressing sympathy for the Ephemeras' short lives. The fly counters by explaining that they both have just one life and the difference is simply in the way it is measured. I imagine that this story may have been the inspiration for an interesting little commercial that Vodafone ran around 2006.

The King said he would give the prize to the one who jumped the highest. The winner was the Flea. The Leapfrog was the second. The third was the King. The fourth was the Queen. The fifth was the king.. The Leap-frog said nothing; but people gave it as their opinion, that he therefore thought the more. When the housedog snuffed at him with his nose, he confessed the Leap- frog was of good family. It was thus that the Flea and the Grasshopper gave an account of themselves, and thought they were quite good enough to marry a Princess.. The old councillor, who had had three orders given him to make him hold his tongue, asserted that the Leap-frog was a prophet. ""I say nothing, it is true,"" exclaimed the King; ""but I. The King said, ""There is nothing above my daughter; therefore to bound up to her is the highest jump that can be made"" The Flea jumped so high that nobody could see where he went to; so they all asserted he had not jumped at all; and that was dishonorable. The Grasshopper jumped only half as high; but he leaped into the King's face, who said that was ill-mannered.. The Grasshopper reflected on worldly things, and said, ""Yes, a fine exterior is everything"" The Flea then went into foreign service, where, it is said, he was killed.

She carried a quantity of matches in an old apron, and she held a bundle of them in her hand. The little maiden walked on with her tiny naked feet, that were quite red and blue from. The snow fell in beautiful curls around her neck. Nobody had bought anything of her the whole livelong day. No one had given her a single farthing. From all the windows the candles were gleaming, and it smelt so deliciously of roast goose, for you know it was New Year's Eve.. ""Rischt!"" how it blazed, how it burnt! It was a warm, bright flame, like a candle, as she held her hands over it: it was a wonderful light. It seemed really to the little maiden as though she were sitting before a large iron stove, with burnished brass feet and a brass ornament at. The goose hopped down from the dish, reeled about on the floor with knife and fork in its breast, till it came up to the poor little girl. When--the match went out and nothing but the thick. ""Someone is just dead!"" said the little girl. The lights of the Christmas tree rose higher and higher, she saw them now as stars in heaven; one fell down and formed a long trail of fire. She drew another match against the wall: it was again light, and in the lustre there stood the old. The little girl was frozen to death on the last evening of the old year. ""She wanted to warm herself,"" people said. No one even dreamed of the splendor in which, with her grandmother she had entered."
0.72,0.82,61.97344697590559,"Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid or 'Den lille Havfrue' (1837) is one of the most famous works of children's literature. The story is set in the ocean, and is based on Andersen's own experiences. The sea is very deep, and many, many steeples would have to be stacked to reach the surface. The palace of the sea king is made of coral, but the roof is made from mussel shells that open and shut with the tide. It is down there that the sea folk live, and the most marvelous trees and flowers grow down there, with such pliant stalks and leaves that the least stir in the water makes them move about as though they were alive.. The sea king down there had been a widower for years, and his old mother kept house for him. She was a clever woman, but very proud of her noble birth. Therefore she flaunted twelve oysters on her tail while the other ladies of the court were only allowed to wear six. Except for this she was an altogether praiseworthy person, particularly so because she was extremely fond of her granddaughters, the little sea princesses. They were six lovely girls, but the youngest was the most beautiful of them all. Her skin was as soft and tender as a rose petal, and her eyes were as blue as the deep sea, but like all the others she had no feet. Her body ended in a fish tail.. Outside the palace was a big garden, with flaming red and deep-blue trees. The soil was very fine sand indeed, but as blue as burning brimstone. When there was a dead calm, you could just see the sun, like a scarlet flower with light streaming from its calyx. One of them made her little flower bed in the shape of a whale, another thought it neater to shape hers like a little mermaid. The youngest of them make hers as round as the sun and there she grew only flowers which were as red as the Sun itself. The princesses would eat out of their hands and let themselves be petted by the fish.. The story of a young girl who found a statue in a sunken ship. The girl's grandmother told her all she knew about ships and cities, and of people and animals. She was an unusual child, quiet and wistful, and when her sisters decorated their gardens with all kinds of odd things they had found in sunken ships, she would allow nothing in hers except flowers as red as the sun, and a pretty marble statue. Beside the statue she planted a rose-colored weeping willow tree, which thrived so well that its graceful branches shaded the statue and hung down to the blue sand, where their shadows took on a violet tint. It looked as if the roots and the tips of the branches were kissing each other.. The princess had never seen a bird before. She thought it was nice that the woods were green. And that the fish you saw among their branches could sing so loud and sweet that it was delightful to hear them. Her grandmother had not told them half enough, and there were so many thing that they longed to know about. But each sister promised to tell the others about all that she saw, and what she found most marvelous on her first day. The princess was the most eager of them all. She was the youngest, the very one who was so quiet and wistful. The youngest still had five long years to wait until she could rise up from the water and see what our world was like. She would be fifteen by then.. The eldest princess had her fifteenth birthday, so now she received permission to rise up out of the water. When she got back she had a hundred things to tell her sisters about, but the most marvelous thing of all, she said, was to lie on a sand bar in the moonlight, when the sea was calm, and to gaze at the large city on the shore, where the lights twinkled like hundreds of stars. Little did they dream that a pretty young mermaid was down below, stretching her white arms up toward the keel of their ship. The mermaid's story is told in the novel ""The Little Mermaid"" by Agatha Christie, published in 18th-century England. The book is published by Hodder & Stoughton, at a cost of £16.99.. The youngest sister longed to enter the city, but could not. She thought of that great city with all of its clatter and clamor, and even fancied that in these depths she could hear the church bells ring. The next year, her second sister had permission to rise up to the surface and swim wherever she pleased. She came up just at sunset, and she said that this spectacle was the most marvelous sight she had ever seen. The heavens had a golden glow, and as for the clouds - she could not find words to describe their beauty. Splashed with red and tinted with violet, they sailed over her head.. The third sister swam up a broad river that flowed into the ocean. She saw gloriously green, vine-colored hills. Palaces and manor houses could be glimpsed through the splendid woods. She heard all the birds sing, and the sun shone so brightly that often she had to dive under the water to cool her burning face. The fourth sister was not so venturesome. She stayed far out among the rough waves, which she said was a marvelous place. She wanted to play with them, but they took fright and ran away. Then along came a little black animal - it was a dog, but she had never seen a dog before. It barked at her so ferociously that she took fright herself, and fled.. The fifth sister had her turn. Her birthday came in the wintertime, so she saw things that none of the others had seen. She had seen ships, but they were so far away that they looked like sea gulls. Playful dolphins had turned somersaults, and monstrous whales had spouted water through their nostrils. Thunder cracked and lightning darted across the heavens. The sea was a deep green color, and enormous icebergs drifted about. They assumed the most fantastic shapes, and sparkled like diamonds. She sat on the largest one, and all the ships that came sailing by sped away as soon as the frightened sailors saw her.. The story of the five sisters who lived at the bottom of the sea. The sisters would rise to the surface, arm in arm, all five in a row. They would sing seductively of how beautiful it was at the top of the ocean. But people could not understand their song, and mistook it for the voice of the storm. The story was written by the sisters' mother, who died in a shipwreck in the 18th century.

When their ship went down they were drowned, and it was as dead men that they reached the sea king's palace. When the mermaids rose through the water, arm in arm, their youngest sister stayed behind all alone, looking after them and wanting to weep. ""Oh, how I do wish I were fifteen!"" she said. ""I know I shall love that world up there and all the people who live in it."". The mermaid's grandmother told her to put up with a good deal to keep up appearances. The old queen let eight big oysters fasten themselves to the princess's tail, as a sign of her high rank. ""Good-by,"" she said, and up she went through the water, as light and as sparkling as a bubble. The sun had just gone down when her head rose above the surface, but the clouds still shone like gold and roses. The air was mild and fresh and the sea unruffled. A great three-master lay in view with only one of all its sails set, for there was not even the whisper of a breeze.. The little mermaid swam right up to the window of the main cabin. She could peep in through the clear glass panes at the crowd of brilliantly dressed people. The handsomest of them all was a young Prince with big dark eyes. It was his birthday and that was the reason for all the celebration. Up on deck the sailors were dancing, and when the Prince appeared among them a hundred or more rockets flew through the air, making it as bright as day. These startled the little mertle so badly that she ducked under the water. But she soon peeped up again, and then it seemed as if all the stars in the sky were falling around her. Never had she seen such fireworks. The mermaid was later found dead in the sea.. The story of a mermaid and a prince is told by the author in a novel. The story is set during a storm in the middle of the night. The mermaid is unable to take her eyes off the ship and the handsome Prince. The ship begins to sail as the waves rise and the clouds gather. The prince is seen laughing and smiling as he shakes the hands of the people on board. The book is called The Prince and the Little Mermaid and is published by Macmillan at £16.99. For more information on the novel, visit www.macmillan.co.uk or read the book on Amazon.com/The-Prince-and-The-Little-Mermaid.. The ship broke in half, and the crew were forced to swim to safety. The crew were unable to reach the survivors. The ship's captain was killed in the crash. The survivors were rescued by the crew of a nearby ship, which had also been hit by the storm, and were taken to hospital. The survivor was taken to a hospital, where she was treated for her injuries. She was later released and returned to her family. The story of the ship's crew is told in the book ""The Shipwrecked"" by William Shakespeare. The book is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99, and is available in English and French. For more information on the book, visit www.hodderandstoughton.com.. The Prince was exhausted and would have died if the little mermaid had not come to help him. She held his head above water, and let the waves take them wherever the waves went. She saw dry land rise before her in high blue mountains, topped with snow as glistening white as if a flock of swans were resting there. Down by the shore were splendid green woods, and in the foreground stood a church, or perhaps a convent; she didn't know which, but anyway it was a building. Orange and lemon trees grew in its garden, and tall palm trees grew beside the gateway. Here the sea formed a little harbor, quite calm and very deep. She kissed him again and hoped that he would live. The sun rose out of the waters, red and bright.. The little mermaid swam away behind some tall rocks that stuck out of the water. She covered her hair and her shoulders with foam so that no one could see her tiny face. She then watched to see who would find the poor Prince. She felt very unhappy, and when they led him away to the big building she dived sadly down into the water and returned to her father's palace. She had always been quiet and wistful, and now she became much more so. She became more and more unhappy. The mermaid watched the Prince regain consciousness, and smile at everyone around him. But he did not even know that she had saved him. He did not smile at her, for he didn't even know he had been saved.. Many evenings and many mornings she revisited the spot where she had left the Prince. Her sisters asked her what she had seen on her first visit up to the surface, but she would not tell them a thing. It was her one consolation to sit in her little garden and throw her arms about the beautiful marble statue. But she took no care of her flowers now. They overgrew the paths until the place was a wilderness, and their long stalks and leaves became so entangled in the branches of the tree that it cast a gloomy shade. Eventually she couldn't bear it any longer. She told her secret to one of her sisters. Immediately all the other sisters heard about it. No one else knew, except a few more mermaids who told no one - except their most intimate friends.. The princess knew where the Prince's palace stood. She swam much closer to shore than any of her sisters would dare venture. She even went far up a narrow stream, under the splendid marble balcony that cast its long shadow in the water. She knew where he came from and where his kingdom was. She was a very good swimmer and could go far and far in the sea. She also knew that he was a good king and that he would always look after her. But she was a little girl, and she was not to be trusted with such a great power. She would have to wait until he was dead. She had to wait for him to die. She did not want to wait. She wanted to be with him. She loved him.. The young Prince used to sit and watch the young Prince when he thought himself alone in the bright moonlight. She would peep out through the green rushes, and if the wind blew her long silver veil, anyone who saw it mistook it for a swan spreading its wings. She grew to like human beings, and more and more she longed to live among them. Their world seemed so much wider than her own, for they could skim over the sea in ships, and mount up into the lofty peaks high over the clouds, and their lands stretched out in woods and fields farther than the eye could see. This made her proud to think that it was she who had saved his life when he was buffeted about, half dead among the waves.. ""If men aren't drowned, do they live on forever?"" the little mermaid asked. ""Yes,"" the old lady said, ""and their lifetimes are even shorter than ours"" ""Why weren't we given an immortal soul?"" the mermaid said. ""We are like the green seaweed - once cut down, it never grows again"" ""Just as we rise through the water to see the lands on earth, so men rise up to beautiful places unknown, which we shall never see,"" the little lady said. 'We have no immortal soul, no life. We are just living in this world,' the little girl added. 'And we will die in the next life.' 'We are not immortal,' the old woman replied. 'Just like the seaweed, we are not dead.. ""I would gladly give up my three hundred years if I could be a human being only for a day, and later share in that heavenly realm,"" said the girl. ""You must not think about that,"" said her grandmother. ""We fare much more happily and are much better off than the folk up there"" ""Can't I do anything at all to win an immortal soul?"" the girl asked. ""No,"" her grandmother answered. ""Not unless a humanBeing loved you so much that you meant more to him than his father and mother"" ""Then I must also die and float as foam upon the sea, not hearing the music of the waves, and seeing neither the beautiful flowers nor the red sun,"" the girl said.. The ballroom was made of massive but transparent glass. Many hundreds of huge rose-red and grass-green shells stood on each side in rows. Across the floor of the hall ran a wide stream of water. On this the mermaids and mermen danced to their own entrancing songs. They have such poor taste that to be thought beautiful there you have to have two awkward props which they call legs. - We are holding a court ball this evening. The walls and the ceiling of the great ballroom were made ofmassive but transparent Glass. The halls and the ceilings of theGreat Ballroom weremade of massive and transparent glass, with the blue flames that burned in each shell illuminating the whole room. You could see the countless fish, great and small, swimming toward the glass walls. On some of them the scales gleamed. The story of a mermaid who fell in love with a prince. The tale was told in a book of the same name. The book was published in 18th century England. The story was later turned into a film starring Liam Neeson. The film was called The Descendant and was released in 2011. The movie was directed by Ridley Scott and was directed at the end of the first century of the 20th century. It was the first film in the series to be released in Britain and Ireland. The plot was based on the novel The Descent of the Prince of Wales. The novel was published by William Morrow and Co in 1805 and 1815.. The little mermaid set out from her garden toward the whirlpools that raged in front of the witch's dwelling. She had never gone that way before. No flowers grew there, nor any seaweed. Bare and gray, the sands extended to the whirledpools, where like roaring mill wheels the waters whirled and snatched everything within their reach down to the bottom of the sea. Between these tumultuous whirl pools she had to thread her way through a hot seething mire, which the witch called her peat marsh. Beyond it her house lay in the middle of a weird forest, where all the trees and shrubs were polyps, half animal and half plant. They looked like hundred-headed snakes growing out of the soil.. The mermaid was attacked by slimy polyps. She saw that every one of them held something that it had caught with its hundreds of little tentacles. The white bones of men who had perished at sea and sunk to these depths could be seen in the polyps' arms. The most ghastly sight of all was a little mermaid whom they had caught and strangled. The mermaid escaped by swimming through the water like a fish. She was rescued by the Prince of the Sea. The story of the mermaid and the Prince is told in the book, The Prince and the Mermaid, by C.S. Lewis, which is published by Hodder & Stoughton at £16.99.. The sea witch was a woman who lived in a house built of the bones of shipwrecked men. She let a toad eat out of her mouth, and called the ugly fat water snakes her little chickabiddies. The princess wanted to get rid of her fish tail and have two props instead, so that she could walk about like a human creature. The witch gave such a loud cackling laugh that the toad and the snakes were shaken to the ground, where they lay writhing. She said: ""It is very foolish of you, but just the same you shall have your way, for it will bring you to grief, my proud princess"" The story was told in the book ""The Sea Witch's Daughter"". ""I am willing to help you, but are you willing to suffer all this?"" said the witch. ""Yes,"" the little mermaid said in a trembling voice, as she thought of the Prince and of gaining a human soul. J shall compound you a draught, and before sunrise you must swim to the shore with it, seat yourself on dry land, and drink the draught down. Then your tail will divide and shrink until it becomes what the people on earth call a pair of shapely legs. But it will hurt; it will feel as if a sharp sword slashed through you. Everyone who sees you will say that you are the most graceful human being they have ever laid eyes on"". ""If you do not win the love of the Prince so completely that for your sake he forgets his father and mother, cleaves to you with his every thought and his whole heart, then you will win no immortal soul"" ""I shall take that risk,"" said the little mermaid, but she turned as pale as death. ""I will take the very best thing that you have, in return for my sovereign draught"" ""You have the sweetest voice of anyone down here at the bottom of the sea, and while I don't doubt that you would like to captivate the Prince with it, you must. The witch hung her caldron over the flames, to brew the draught. ""Cleanliness is a good thing,"" she said, as she tied her snakes in a knot and scoured out the pot with them. Then she pricked herself in the chest and let her black blood splash into the caldrons. Steam swirled up from it, in such ghastly shapes that anyone would have been terrified by them. The witch constantly threw new ingredients into the Caldron, and it started to boil with a sound like that of a crocodile shedding tears. The little mermaid said: ""What will be left to me if you take my voice?"". The mermaid's tongue was cut off and she could neither sing nor talk. The polyps curled up in terror as soon as they saw the bright draught. Her heart felt as if it would break with grief. The lights had been snuffed out in the great ballroom, and doubtless everyone in the palace was asleep. Now that she was stricken dumb and was leaving her home forever, she could see her father's palace. She could not go near them, now that she had been stricken dumb. The mermaid could no longer see. She had been struck dumb and could not see. The witch had made a draught of water.. The little mermaid took one flower from each of her sisters' little plots. She blew a thousand kisses toward the palace, and then mounted up through the dark blue sea. The sun had not yet risen when she saw the Prince"

The youngest of them are quite satisfied with ""kribble, krabble,"" or such nonsense, and think it very grand. The elder ones want something with a deeper meaning.. The first stork pair who related it lived at the time it happened, and had their summer residence on the rafters of the Viking's house. It has been repeated from mouth to mouth, from one stork-mamma to another, for thousands of years. This wilderness is still an immense wild heath of marshy ground, about which we can read in the ""Official Directory"". The Wild Moor is a wild expanse of marsh and lake. It may well be called the Wild Moor. Many things may be noticed now that existed then. There still stands the birch, with its white bark and its delicate, loosely hanging leaves. The fly still wears a gauzy dress of the same cut, and the favorite colors of the stork are white, with black and red for stockings.. The castle of the Viking was built by a stork in the moorlands of Norway. The stork-mamma sat on her eggs and felt sure her hatching would come to something. One evening the stork Papa came home and said he had something very dreadful to tell her. ""Keep it to yourself then,"" she replied. ""Remember that I am hatching eggs;. The stork tells the mother stork about his daughter. ""She who sprung from the race of the fairies, is it?"" she asks. ""Oh, tell me all about it; you know I cannot bear to be kept waiting at a time when I am hatching eggs"" ""She believed what the doctors said, and what I have heard you state also, that the moor-fl. ""Look carefully now; there is one not all swan, only swan's feathers,"" said the stork-papa. ""I immediately recognized her as one of the princesses of our home in Egypt"" ""I heard her tell the two others to take great care of the swans' plumage"" ""She dipped down into the water to pluck the flowers which she fancied she saw there"". ""The princess wept and lamented aloud; her tears moistened the elder stump"" ""The princess was really not an elder stump but the Marsh King himself"" ""I feel as if I could hardly bear to hear any more, but you must tell me what happened next."" ""The two deceitful princesses flew away."". ""I saw myself how the stump of the tree turned round, and was a tree no more, while long, clammy branches like arms, were extended from it"" ""It would have broken your heart, mother, had you seen it."" ""I think the princess will soon find help; some one will rise up to help her"" ""The princess is buried in the. ""I mean to go every day,"" said he, ""to see if anything comes to pass"" A long time went by, but at last he saw a green stalk shooting up out of the deep, marshy ground. The little one was so like the Egyptian princess, that the stork, at the first moment, thought it must be the princess herself.. The stork flew to the castle, picked a hole with his beak in the bladder-covered window, and laid the beautiful child in the bosom of the Viking's wife. ""But she cannot be left to lie here,"" thought the stork, ""and in my nest there are already so many"". The Viking's wife was above measure delighted when she awoke the next morning and found the beautiful little child lying in her bosom. She kissed it and caressed it; but it cried terribly, and struck out with its arms and legs, and did not seem to be pleased at all. At last it cried itself to sleep; and as it lay there so still and quiet, it was a most beautiful sight to see. ""So you see,"" he continued. The Viking's wife was very tired, and quickly fell into a sound sleep. When she awoke, just before morning, she was terribly alarmed to find that the infant had vanished. She sprang from her couch, lighted a pine-chip, and searched all round the room, when, at last, in that part of the bed where her feet had been, lay, not the child, but a great, ugly frog.. The Viking did not return on that day, nor the next. He was, however, on the way home; but the wind, so favorable to the storks, was against him; for it blew towards the south. The story of the Viking and the frog is told in the novel ""The Book of the Stork"" by William Makepeace Thackeray, who was born in 1775.. The child was under the influence of a powerful sorcerer. By day it was charming in appearance as an angel of light, but with a temper wicked and wild. At night, in the form of an ugly frog, it was quiet and mournful. Who would be able to loosen this wicked charm which the sorcerer had worked upon it? The wife of the Viking lived in constant pain and sorrow about it.. Viktor's wife was afraid he would expose the child in the public highway. She resolved that the Viking should never see the child excepting by daylight. More than a hundred pair of storks had rested there during the night, to recover themselves after their excursion. They now soared aloft, and prepared for the journey south.. Viktor's castle on the moorland was filled with mead and cattle. Guests were invited, and received handsome presents. All wrongs and unfaithfulness were forgotten. They drank deeply, and threw in each other's faces the bones that were left, which was looked upon as a sign of good feeling amongst them. ""Do not use your beaks so much; it tries the lungs,"" said the Viking.. A bard, who was a kind of musician as well as warrior, gave them one of his best songs, in which they heard all their warlike deeds praised, and every wonderful action brought forward with honor. Every verse ended with this refrain: ""And with that they beat upon their shields, and hammered upon the table with knives and bones, in a most outrageous manner"". The full cask of mead soon became empty, and a fresh one was brought in. The bondmen slept in the ashes, and dipped their fingers in the fat, and licked them. Oh, it was a delightful time! Once more in the same year the Viking went forth, though the storms of autumn had already commenced to roar.. The frog's foster-mother began to love the poor frog, with its gentle eyes and its deep sighs. The storks might have been found in the land of Egypt, where the sun's rays shone forth bright and warm, as it does here at midsummer. The sparrows took possession of the stork's nest, and conversed about the absent owners in. The Nile had retreated, and the whole bed of the river was covered with frogs, which was a most acceptable prospect for the stork families. Tamarinds and acacias were in full bloom all over the country, the crescent of Mahomet glittered brightly from the cupolas of the mosques.. The young storks thought their eyes deceived them, everything around appeared so beautiful. ""It is always like this here, and this is how we live in our warm country,"" said the stork-mamma. ""Beyond this delightful region there are immense forests, where the branches of the trees entwine round each other, while prickly, creeping plants. The parents sat in the nest on the slender minaret, and rested, yet still were busily employed in cleaning and smoothing their feathers. The female young ones strutted about amid the moist rushes, glancing at the other young storks and making acquaintances. The young male storks soon began to quarrel; they struck at each other with their wings, and pecked with their beaks till the blood came. And in. In hot countries people are almost all violent and passionate, says the author. But in the rich castle of their Egyptian host, as they called him, pleasure was not to be found. The rich and mighty lord of the castle lay on his couch, in the midst of the great hall, with its many colored walls. He was stiff and powerless in all his limbs, and lay stretched out like a mummy.. ""We three flew away together through the air,"" said they: ""a hunter caught sight of us, and shot at us with an arrow"" The arrow struck our young friend and sister, and slowly singing her farewell song she sank down, a dying swan, into the forest lake. On the shores of the lake, under a spreading birch-tree, we laid her. The stork-papa snapped with his beak so that it might be heard a long way off. The learned and wise men assembled together, and talked a great deal on every point. But the stork could make no sense out of anything they said. Neither were there any good results from their consultations, either for the sick man, or for his daughter. ""What a beautiful thought!"" exclaimed the papa stork immediately. ""I don't quite understand it,"" said the mamma stork, when her husband repeated it. ""however, it is not my fault, but the fault of the thought"" ""Only through love can the sick man be cured,"" had been said by many, and even the learned men acknowledged that it was a wise saying.. The stork-papa could not understand all these things. He stood the whole of the following day on one leg, with half-shut eyes, thinking deeply. The wise and learned men had asserted that ""love, the life-giver, could alone give new life to a father;"" and in saying this, they had overdone it, and said more than they understood themselves.. The princess had gone to the marble sphinx in the desert, shaking the sand from her sandals, and then passed through the long passage, which leads to the centre of one of the great pyramids. She had been told by the wise men, that if she laid her head on the breast of a mummies, from the head she would learn where to find life and recovery for her father.. The Marsh King has drawn her down to himself, and that to the loved ones at home she is forever dead. She had performed all this, and in a dream had learnt that she must bring home to her father the lotus flower, which grows in the deep sea.. The stork wanted to hide the swan's feathers from those two treacherous princesses. ""I can hide the two suits of feathers over yonder, till we find some use for them,"" he said. ""But where will you put them?"" asked the mamma stork. ""In our nest on the moor,"" he replied. ""And as we return, should they prove too heavy. The stork-mamma said: ""No one will thank you for it, but you are master"" The child grew to be almost a woman, and before any one seemed aware of it, she was a wonderfully beautiful maiden of sixteen. She was, indeed, wild and savage even in those hard, uncultivated times. It was a pleasure to her to splash about with her white hands in the warm blood of the. Helga was a beautiful girl who was bewitched by her beauty. She would often leap from the high shore into the sea with all her clothes on, and swim to meet the Viking. She once cut off a long lock of her beautiful hair, and twisted it into a string for her bow. Without a saddle, she would sit on a horse as if she were a part of it, while it rushed along.. ""If a thing is to be done well, I must do it myself,"" said the Viking's wife. She would dive into the water of the well, and come back dripping with water. She was a woman of strong character and will, compared to her husband. She knew that a wicked child had the terrible child in his power.. Viking's wife took her on her lap, and forgot the ugly form, as she forgot her ugly form. She looked like a wretched dwarf, with a frog's head, and webbed fingers. Her eyes had a most piteous expression; she was without a voice, excepting a hollow, croaking sound"

It was built entirely of porcelain, and very costly. In the garden could be seen the most singular flowers, with pretty silver bells tied to them, which tinkled so that every one who passed could not help noticing the flowers. In one of these trees lived a nightingale, who sang so beautifully that even the poor fishermen, who had so many other things to do, would stop and listen. The gardener himself did not know where it ended. Those who travelled beyond its limits knew that there was a noble forest, with lofty trees, sloping down to the deep blue sea, and the great ships sailed under its branches.. Travellers from every country in the world came to the city of the emperor, which they admired very much, as well as the palace and gardens. But when they heard the nightingale, they all declared it to be the best of all. Learned men wrote books, containing descriptions of the town, the palace, and the gardens. Those who could write poetry composed beautiful verses about the nightedale. The books travelled all over the world, and some of them came into the hands of the Emperor. He nodded his approval every moment, for it pleased him to find such a beautiful description of his city, his palace and his gardens. He said: 'I am pleased to have found such a description of my city, and my palace, which I am proud to call home'. The story of the nightingale is told in the novel, The Nightingale by William Makepeace Thackeray. The story is based on a conversation between the emperor and his lord-in-waiting. The emperor asks his lord if there is such a bird in his empire and garden. The lord replies that he has never heard of such a creature. The author says the story is a good example of the power of books to teach us about the world. The book is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99.. The story of the nightingale is said to have been written by the Japanese emperor. The story was said to be a fable, invented by those who had written the book. But the emperor said that the book was sent to him by the great and mighty emperor of Japan, and therefore it cannot contain a falsehood. The emperor said he would try to find the bird himself, but could not find her. He said: ""The whole world knows what I possess better than I do myself"" The story is believed to have taken place in Japan in the 16th. The lord-in-waiting ran up and down stairs, through all the halls and corridors. Half the court ran with him, for they did not like the idea of being trampled upon. At last they met with a poor little girl in the kitchen, who said, Oh, yes, I know the nightingale quite well; indeed, she can sing. Every evening I have permission to take home to my poor sick mother the scraps from the table. She lives down by the sea-shore, and as I come back I feel tired, and I sit down in the wood to rest, and listen to the nightedales song.. The little girl leads the court to the nightingale, who sings to the emperor. As they go along, a cow begins lowing in the woods. The little girl says it is only a cow; we are a long way from the place yet. Then the tears come into my eyes, and it is just as if my mother kissed me, she says. The court follows the little girl as she leads them to the palace. The emperor dines at the palace, and the little maiden is given constant employment in the kitchen.. The story is about a young girl who is asked to sing by the emperor. The girl's voice sounds like a nightingale's, says the lord-in-waiting. The emperor asks her to sing a song for him, and she begins to sing. The story ends with the girl singing to the emperor, and the emperor singing to her. The tale is about the emperor and his daughter, and their love for each other. The book is called ""The Emperor and the Little Nightingale"". The nightingale was invited to a court festival by the emperor. The palace was elegantly decorated for the occasion. The whole court was present, and the little kitchen-maid had received permission to stand by the door. She was not installed as a real court cook. The bird was not allowed to sing in the green wood, but still she came willingly when she heard the emperors wish. The emperor was delighted with her singing. He said she would be a great success at court. The courtier said he had never heard such a charming song before. The nightingALE was delighted. She thought the emperor was present. She sang for him again. He was delighted and said she was a success. The song was sung again.. The emperor was so delighted that he declared the nightingale should have his gold slipper to wear round her neck, but she declined the honor with thanks. The ladies of the court took water in their mouths to make them utter the gurgling sounds of the nightedale when they spoke to any one. And the footmen and chambermaids also expressed their satisfaction, which is saying a great deal, for they are very difficult to please. In fact the nighter's visit was most successful. In the end the emperor was not so happy with the nighters. He was so angry with them that he sent them back to England. The nighters returned the next day with a new set of clothes and a new attitude. The emperor was very pleased with them.. The bird was to have her own room, and to go out at night. She was to be held by 12 people, who would hold her by a string. She would then be able to fly, and could sing like a real bird. The bird was called The Nightingale, and was named after the Nightingales. She died in 1855. The Nightedale was a bird of prey, which is now called the Skylark, after the nightingale. It is a bird that can fly, but can't sing. It was named for the Nightedales, who were the first people to fly. The nightingales are now known as the Nighters, after their first inhabitants, the Nightlings.. The Emperor of Japans nightingale is poor compared with that of the Emperor of Chinas. The real nightingales sang in their own natural way, but the artificial bird sang only waltzes. Three and thirty times did it sing the same tunes without being tired. But the emperor said the living nightedale ought to sing something. So then it had to sing alone, and was as successful as the real bird. Besides, it was so much prettier to look at, for it sparkled like bracelets and breast-pins. The emperor said it should sing a duet, but it was too much work.. The bird flew out at the open window, back to her own green woods. No one had noticed her when she flew out. But the music-master praised the bird in the highest degree. He said it was better than a real nightingale, not only in its dress and the beautiful diamonds, but also in its musical power. With a realNightingale we can never tell what is going to be sung, but with this bird everything is settled. For you must perceive, my chief lord and emperor, that with a real Nightingales we cannever tell what we are going to sing. With this bird, with this Bird, everything issettled. The real nightingale was banished from the empire, and the artificial bird placed on a silk cushion close to the emperors bed. The presents of gold and precious stones which had been received with it were round the bird. It was now advanced to the title of Little Imperial Toilet Singer, and to the rank of No. 7. It can be opened and explained, so that people may understand how the waltzes are formed, and why one note follows upon another. The music-master received permission to exhibit the bird to the people on the following Sunday. When they heard it they were like people intoxicated; however it must have been with drinking tea, which is quite a Chinese custom. They all said Oh! and held up their forefingers.. The music-master wrote a work, in twenty-five volumes, about the artificial bird, which was very learned and very long. The emperor considered the left side, on which the heart lies, as the most noble, and the heart of an emperor is in the same place as that of other people. The street-boys sang, Zi-zi-zi, cluck, clucking, clucks, and even the emperor himself could sing it also. It was really most amusing. One evening, when the artificial. bird was singing its best, and. the emperor lay in bed listening to it, something inside the bird sounded whizz. Then a spring cracked. Whir-r- r-r went all the wheels, running round, and then the music stopped.. The bird was put into something like order, as the barrels were worn, and it would be impossible to put in new ones without injuring the music. The bird could only be allowed to play once a year, and even that was dangerous for the works inside it. The Chinese were fond of the bird, and he was not expected to live long. But he did, and his life was saved. The story of his life is told in the novel ""The Emperor's New Cloak"" by the Chinese playwright and poet, C.S. H. M. Beresford, who was born in China in 1858.. The emperor was not yet dead, although he lay white and stiff on his gorgeous bed, with the long velvet curtains and heavy gold tassels. A window stood open, and the moon shone in upon the emperor and the artificial bird. The poor emperor, finding he could scarcely breathe with a strange weight on his chest, opened his eyes, and saw Death sitting there. He had put on the emperors golden crown, and held in one hand his sword of state, and in the other his beautiful banner. The whole court thought he was dead, and every one ran away to pay homage to his successor. The chamberlains went out to have a talk on the matter, and  the ladies-maids invited company to take coffee.. The emperor was in a room in China when he heard the sounds of music coming from the window. He looked out and saw a number of strange heads peeping through the curtains. He asked them to sing, but they refused to sing. He then said: ""I know nothing about it, I may not hear what they say."" The music continued, but the emperor could not hear it. He said: 'I have given you gold and costly presents. I have even hung my golden slipper round your neck' The music stopped. The emperor then said, 'I am not sure what to say to you. I am afraid I don't know what you are saying.' The music went on. The room was silent, and the emperor was afraid.. The story of the death of the Emperor is told by the nightingale. The bird sings of hope and trust to the dying Emperor. The song brings the blood of the emperor to his weak limbs. Death longs to go and see his garden, and floats out through the window in the form of a cold, white mist. The story ends with the bird singing to the Emperor, and he says: ""Thanks, thanks, you heavenly little bird. I know you well"" The story is told in the book, The Death of the Emperors, which is published by William Morrow, priced £16.99, and published by Hodder & Stoughton, London, is out now.. The emperor fell into a sweet sleep, and how mild and refreshing that slumber was! When he awoke, strengthened and restored, the sun shone brightly through the window. But not one of his servants had returned; all believed he was dead. Only the nightingale still sat beside him, and sang. The emperor said: 'You must always remain with me, and I will break the artificial bird into a thousand pieces. Keep it here still. I cannot live in the palace, and build my nest; but let me come when I like' The emperor then said: 'I will sing to you again. I banished you from my kingdom once, and yet you have charmed away the evil faces from my bed, and banished Death from my heart, with your sweet song'. The emperor asked the nightingale to sing to him outside his window. She said she would, if he would promise to keep her secret. The emperor said he would, and she flew away. The nightingales returned the next day. The Emperor was found dead in his bed, and the servants came in to look after him. He stood up and said, 'Good morning' and then went back to his bed. He died the following morning. He was buried in a secret place. The servants came to look for him, and found him there. He said he had died of a heart attack, and had been killed by a sword. He had also been stabbed in the back by a servant."

Never covet an old man's nightcap that may contain valuable thoughts, dreams (or pearls) It could yield quite disturbing results. ""Hysken"" street is said to be German, but that is unjust to the Germans, for it would then be called ""Hauschen,"" not ""HYSken"" ""Huschen,"" means a little house; and for many years it consisted only of a few small houses, which were scarcely larger than the wooden booths we see in the market-places at fair time.. The German clerks in Copenhagen got their nickname of ""pepper gentry"" Many of them were very aged; lonely old boys, with strange thoughts and eccentric habits. It had been made a condition with these clerks that they should not marry. Those who lived to be old had to take care of themselves, to attend to their own comforts, and even to light their own fires, when they had any to light. The German beer was very good, and there were many sorts—from Bremen, Prussia, and Brunswick—and quantities of all sorts of spices, saffron, aniseed, ginger, and especially pepper; indeed, pepper was almost the chief article sold here. It was a long time ago, so long indeed.. The story of the ""pepper gentry"" is told in a Danish song. The boys in Denmark make a song of it, thus: ""So they sing about the ""Pepper gentleman"" So do they make sport of the poor old bachelor and his nightcap, and all because they really know nothing of either. It is a cap that no one need wish for, or laugh at. And why not? Well, we shall hear in the story. The story of Hauschen Street, in Copenhagen, is told by a Danish boy in a song called ""The Pepper Gentry"" The story is told of a man who falls in love with a girl, and the two fall in love. The boy is told that the girl is not interested in him, but wants to get away from him.. Behind the counter, as a rule, there were no young men. The clerks were almost all old boys. At these times the odor of the pepper, saffron, and ginger became more powerful than ever. They wore high-crowned, broad-brimmed hats, and sometimes a younger clerk would stick a feather in his. The woollen shirt was concealed by a broad, linen collar. The close jacket was buttoned up to the chin, and the cloak hung loosely over it. The trousers were tucked into the broad, tipped shoes, for the clerks wore no stockings. One of them would have made a very interesting picture for us now, if taken as he appeared standing behind his counter, or going to church.. Anthony was one of the oldest of the clerks, and just the subject for a painter. He was as thin as a lath, wrinkled round the mouth and eyes, had long, bony fingers, bushy, gray eyebrows, and over his left eye hung a thick tuft of hair. People knew that he came from Bremen; it was not exactly his home, although his master resided there. His ancestors were from Thuringia, and had lived in the town of Eisenach, close by Wartburg, close to Wartberg. They generally stuck a table-knife and spoon in their girdles, as well as a larger knife.. The old clerks of Hauschen Street very seldom met together. Each one remained in his own booth, which was closed early enough in the evening. Often, when it was dark night outside, with rain or snow falling, the place looked quite deserted and gloomy. To be a stranger in a strange land is a bitter lot. No one notices you unless you happen to stand in their way. Old Anthony seldom spoke of this place, but he thought of it all the more. The dashing of the water against the bulwarks of a neighboring castle could plainly be heard. It certainly was not a very lively existence. The old clerk would be moving about in his booth till late in the night, busily employed in many things. He would be generally on his bed, singing his evening hymn in a low voice.. Anthony invented employment; he mended his clothes and patched his boots. When he at last went to bed his nightcap, which he had worn from habit, still remained on his head. If even a tiny spark had remained it might set fire to something, and cause great damage. Such evenings are long and dreary, unless people can find something to do; and so Anthony found it. He would rise from his bed, creep down the ladder, and when he reached the fire-pan not a spark could be seen. So he had just to go back again to bed. He was a very industrious man, and his wife was very kind to him. He had a very kind wife, and a very loving daughter. He died in a tragic accident, and she was very sad, but he was very happy to see her.. Anthony would go to bed at night, but would find the iron shutters of the door not properly fastened. He would be so cold that his teeth chattered in his head. He tried to turn his thoughts from trade, and from the labors of the day, to olden times. But thoughts of olden memories raise the curtains from the past, and sometimes pierce the heart with painful recollections. And so it was with Anthony; often the scalding tears, like pearly drops, would fall from his eyes to the coverlet and roll on the floor. Sometimes, with a lurid flame, memory would light up a picture of life which had never faded from his heart. If he dried his eyes with his nightcap, then the tear and the picture would be crushed; but the source of the tears remained and welled up again in his heart,. The beech woods of Denmark are acknowledged by every one to be very beautiful. More beautiful still in the eyes of old Anthony were the beech Woods of Denmark. More grand and more beautiful were the old oaks that hung over the stony summits of the rocks. The beechwoods were the most beautiful place in the world to be seen by old Anthony. They were the perfect setting for a picture of a boy and a girl playing. The boy had rosy cheeks, and the girl had black hair. The two were playing with an apple, and heard the pips rattling in it. The girl had brown eyes and black hair, and was clever and courageous. The boys were playing in the woods, and had just finished eating their dinner. The children were happy and playing, but the boy was sad.. Molly and Anthony cut an apple in half and ate all but one. The little girl then suggested that it should be placed in the ground. The boy made a hole in the earth with his finger, and the little girl placed the pip in the hole, and then they both covered it over with earth. Molly said they should not take it out to-morrow to see if it has taken root. ""I did so with my flowers, but only twice,"" she said. "" I didn't know any better then, and they all died.""Little Anthony kept the flower-pot, and every morning during the whole winter he looked at it, but there was nothing to be seen but black earth.. The story goes that the ""Lady Venus,"" one of the heathen goddesses, keeps house there. The story is mirrored to old Anthony in a single tear, which could soon be wiped away and disappear, but might come again from its source in the heart of the old man. ""How wonderful they are, and so beautiful!"" said the boy. ""Who does that stand for?"" thought he, and then came another and another. Day after day, and week after week, till the plant became quite a tree. ""What is the meaning of life?"" asked the little girl. ""I don't know,"" said the little boy, ""but I think it's good."". Little Molly and Anthony often stood by this mountain, and one day Molly said, ""Do you dare to knock and say, 'Lady Halle, Lady Halle,. open the door: Tannhauser is here!'"" But Anthony did not dare. Molly, however, did, though she only said the words, ""Lady Hallel,"" loudly and distinctly. She looked quite bold and saucy, just as she did sometimes when she was in the garden with a number of other little girls. They would all stand round him together, and want to kiss him, because he did not like to be kissed, and pushed them away. Then Molly was the only one who dared to resist him. ""I may kiss him,"" she would say proudly, as she threw her arms round his neck.. Molly was very charming, but rather bold; and how she did tease! They said Lady Halle was beautiful, but her beauty was that of a tempting fiend. Saint Elizabeth, the tutelar saint of the land, the pious princess of Thuringia, had greater beauty and more real grace. Her picture hung in the chapel, surrounded by silver lamps; but it did not in the least resemble Molly. The apple-tree, which the two children had planted, grew year after year, till it became so large that it had to be transplanted into the garden. And there it increased in strength so much as to be able to withstand the cold of winter; and after passing through the severe weather, it seemed to put forth its blossoms in spring for very joy that the cold season had gone.. Molly's father left his old home, and Molly went with him far away. The way was very long and difficult, with many turnings and windings through towns and villages. Molly had told him that she loved him—loved him more than all the splendors of Weimar. One, two, three years went by, and during the whole time he received only two letters. One came by the carrier, and the other a traveller brought. And Molly and Anthony both wept, but these tears all flowed together into one tear which had the rosy shimmer of joy.. Anthony and Molly heard the story of Tristan and Isolda. Anthony thought it a very beautiful but mournful story. As he passed the spot, he whistled the air of a song, composed by the minstrel Walter, called the ""Willow bird"" One stanza pleased him exceedingly. He sung or whistled it on a moonlight night, when he rode on horseback along the deep, hollow way, on his road to Weimar, to visit Molly. He wished to arrive unexpectedly, and so indeed he did. He wanted to visit unexpectedly, as he had often thought he would. He had thought the story applied to him, although Tristan means born in sorrow, which Anthony certainly was not. He never feared anything so sad would happen.. Anthony Trollope was invited to stay at Molly's house. Molly told him of the changes in their lives since they were children together. Trollope wrote that he could not comprehend his own feelings nor the feelings of others. He said he felt as if he were wishing himself or his neighbor away. Trollopes wrote: ""I am a straightforward girl,"" she said, ""and I will tell you myself how it is. There have been great changes since we were children"" He added: ""We cannot control our wills, nor thefeelings of our hearts, by the force of custom"" He wrote: 'I would not, for the world, make an enemy of you when I am far away' He also said: 'We are incommoding one another, and perhaps all the while we are wishing ourselves or his neighbors away'. ""I will destroy everything that can remind me of her, or of Lady Halle, or Lady Venus,"" he said. ""I will break down the apple-tree, and tear it up by the roots."" ""I am ruined also,"" he added. ""You must try and reconcile yourself to this."" ""You will never be able to love again,"" he told her. ""But I will love you forever"" ""You are my friend,"" she replied. ""And I am your lover"" ""I love you too,"" she said. 'I will always love you.' ""And so it is with all of us,"" she added. 'We will always be together' ""And we will always have each other"" ""And that is the way it is."". Anthony's father lost all his property and became very poor. He had to take his father's place, to give orders, to act with energy, to help. Anthony went to Bremen, and there he learnt what poverty and hard living really were. How different the world, and the people in it, appeared to Anthony now, to what he had thought in his childhood. What to him were the minstrel's songs? An echo of the past, sounds long vanished. These things often harden the character, but sometimes soften the heart, even too much. The world is a very different place to what Anthony had thought it to be in childhood. It is a different world to what his father thought it was in childhood, and he had to learn to live with it.. Anthony's father died, and strangers lived in the old house. The old Wartburg castle stood unchanged on the rock where the monk and the nun were hewn out of the stone. The Venus mountain stood out gray and bare, overshadowing the valley beneath the valley. Anthony's rich master sent him journeys on business, and on one occasion his way led him to his native town of Eisenach. The great oaks formed an outline to the scene which he so well remembered in his childhood. He had seen it once again since then. He would think in this way; yet again and again the songs would sound in his soul, and his heart become gentle and pious. ""God's will is the best,"" he would then say. ""It was well that I was not allowed to keep my power over Molly's heart, and that she did not remain true to me."". Old Anthony thought of the minstrel's song as he looked through the tears on his native town. He would have been glad to call out ""Lady Halle, Lady Halle"" to unlock the mountain. That was a sinful thought, and he offered a prayer to drive it away. Then a little bird in the thicket sang out clearly, and old Anthony thought again of the song. The old house was still standing as in olden times, but the garden had been greatly altered. A pathway led through a portion of the ground, and outside the garden, and beyond the path, stood the old apple-tree, which he had not broken down. One of the branches of the tree had, however, been broken: mischievous hands must have done this in passing, for the tree now stood in a public thoroughfare.. Anthony Bourdain was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1841. He was sent to Bremen on condition that he should never marry. He lived in a wooden house in Hauschen Street, Copenhagen, with his family. He wrote about a tree in a garden by a hedge in a field, and close to a public road. He said the blossoms are often plucked and the fruit is stolen and the branches broken without a thankful thought of their profusion and beauty. The number of blossoms from time to time will grow less, and at last it was cease altogether to bear fruit; and then its history will be over. The tree will die out, but it certainly has not yet withered.. Winter one year set in early, and it was freezing hard. Without, a snowstorm made every one remain at home. During these two days old Anthony had not left his bed, he had not the strength to do so. The bitter weather had for some time affected his limbs. There lay the old bachelor, forsaken by all, and unable to help himself. He could scarcely reach the water jug that he had placed by his bed. It was not fever, nor sickness, but old age, that had laid him low. In the little corner, where his bed lay, he was over-shadowed as it were by perpetual night. He laughed bitterly to himself at the thought. ""Marry! ha, ha!"" and he laughed bitterly at the idea.. Anthony felt as if the world was now nothing to him, as if he were lying beyond it, with no one to think of him. He thought of all those who had once suffered from starvation, of Saint Elizabeth, who once wandered on the earth. A little spider, which he could however not see, busily and cheerfully spun its web above him, so that there should be a kind of little banner waving over the old man, when his eyes closed. The time passed slowly and painfully. He had no tears to shed, and he felt no pain; no thought of Molly came into his mind. Now and then he felt slight sensations of hunger and thirst; but no one came to him,. no one tended him. The recollection of her pious deeds was as light to the soul of poor Anthony.. Anthony recalls a story about a woman who plucked roses from the garden. When her husband asked her what she had in her basket, she said, ""Roses"" He tore away the cloth which covered the basket and found that everything in it had been changed into roses. The fragrance of roses spread through the room, mingled with the sweet smell of apples. He saw the branches of an apple-tree spreading above him. It was the tree which he and Molly had planted together. He uncovered his face that he might look into her gentle eyes. She was as a living reality in his little dwelling in the Danish land. He remembered a story told of her, that on one occasion, when she was carrying a basket full of wine and provisions.. The following day, the third day during which his house had been closed, the snow-storm ceased. Then his opposite neighbor stepped over to the house in which old Anthony lived, for he had not yet showed himself. There he lay stretched on his bed, dead, with his old nightcap tightly clasped in his two hands. The nightcap, however, was not placed on his head in his coffin; he had a clean white one on then. Where now were the tears he had shed? What had become of those wonderful pearls? They were in the nightcap still. Such tears as these cannot be washed out, even when the night cap is forgotten. The old thoughts and dreams of a bachelor's nightcapstill remain. They are in the old thoughts of the bachelor. They still remain in the bachelor's dreams.. The first who wore old Anthony's cap felt the truth of this, though it was half a century afterwards. The moment he put the cap on he dreamed of unfortunate love, of bankruptcy, and of dark days. ""Hallo! how the nightcap burns!"" he exclaimed, as he tore it from his bead. ""What can this be? Is it paralysis, or something dazzling my eyes?"" They were the tears which old Anthony had shed half a hour before. His own history was changed into that of Anthony till it became quite a story. Many stories might be made by others, so we will leave them to relate their own. We will leave you to relate your own.

One evening a terrible storm came on; there was thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in torrents. Suddenly a knocking was heard at the city gate. It was a princess standing out there in front of the gate. But, good gracious! what a sight the rain and the wind had made her look. The water ran down from her hair and clothes; it ran down into the toes of her shoes and out again at the heels. And yet she said that she was areal princess. Well, we'll soon find that out, thought the old queen.. The princess had to lie all night on a hard bed. She felt the pea through the mattresses and the eider-down beds. The prince took her for his wife, for now he knew that he had a real princess. The pea was put in the museum, where it may still be seen, if no one has stolen it. The story is a true story. It is not a fairy tale, but a real story. The princess is a real girl. She is a princess. She was a real woman. She had to feel the peA through the twenty mattresses. The bed was hard, so that she was black and blue all over her body."

One evening there was a terrible storm; it thundered and lightened and the rain poured down in torrents. In the middle of the storm somebody knocked at the town gate, and the old King himself went to open it. It was a princess who stood outside, but she was in a terrible state from the rain and the storm. The water streamed out of her hair and her. The story of the pea is told in the book The Princess and the Pea. The princess took all the bedclothes off and laid a pea on the bed. Then she piled twenty mattresses and twenty feather beds on the top of it. This was where the princess was to sleep that night. In the morning they asked her how she had slept. 'Oh terribly badly!' said the princess. 'I have hardly closed my eyes the whole night! Heaven knows what was in the bed!'"
0.66,0.76,56.34124087591241,"The story of Karen is told in the novel ""The Little Red Riding Hood"" Karen was a little girl who was forced to run about with bare feet in winter. She wore large wooden shoes, which made her insteps quite red. Dame Shoemaker sewed together a pair of shoes out of old red strips of cloth. They were meant for the little girl, and she wore them on the day of her mother's funeral. The story is told by the author in the book ""A Child's Story"" (1954) The book is published by Verso, a division of Verso Publishing, and is available in English and French.. Karen believed all this happened on account of the red shoes, but the old lady thought they were horrible, and they were burnt. Karen herself was cleanly and nicely dressed; she must learn to read and sew; and people said she was a nice little thing. But the looking-glass said: ""Thou art more than nice, thou art beautiful!"" ""I will adopt her!"" said the queen. ""I'll adopt her! I'll adopt my little princess!"" said a king. ""She's a princess, and she's beautiful!"" said Karen. ""But she's a little girl!"" said her mother. ""And I'm a king, too."". Karen's shoes were made for the child of a count, but had not fitted. The old lady knew nothing about their being red. ""That must be patent leather!"" said the old lady. ""They shine so!"" said Karen. ""Yes, they shine!"" they fitted, and they were bought, but the old woman knew nothing. ""It seemed to her as if the old figures on the tombs, those portraits of old preachers and preachers' wives, with stiff ruffs, and long black dresses, fixed their eyes on her red shoes"". Karen wore red shoes to church. The old lady said it was very wrong of her. Karen put on black shoes the next Sunday. The clergyman told her she was now a matured Christian. She was very proud of her shoes. She wore them to church every Sunday for the rest of her life. They were her only shoes. The sun shone gloriously; Karen and the old lady walked along the path through the corn; it was rather dusty there. Karen thought only of her red shoes as the clergyman laid his hand upon her head, and spoke of the holy baptism, of the covenant with God, and how she should be now a mature Christian.. The old lady gave the old soldier alms, and went into the church with Karen. The soldier said, ""See, what beautiful dancing shoes!"" and he put his hand out towards the soles. And Karen could not help dancing a step or two, and when she began her feet continued to dance; it was just as though the shoes had power over them. The old lady got into her carriage. Karen raised her foot to get in after her, when the old Soldier said,   ""Look, whatbeautiful dancing shoes!. Karen's shoes were placed in a closet at home, but she could not avoid looking at them. She put on the red shoes and began to dance at a ball. When she wanted to dance to the right, the shoes danced to the left. She danced round the church corner and could not leave off. At length she took the shoes off, and then her legs had peace. The shoes danced back again, down the steps, into the street, and out of the city gate. She could not stop dancing, and the coachman was obliged to run after and catch hold of her. She was dancing so that she trod on the old lady dreadfully. She thought there could be no sin in it. But then she went to the ball.. Dancing shoes clung to her feet. She danced, and was forced to dance straight out into the gloomy wood. She wished to seat herself on a poor man's grave, where the bitter tansy grew. But when she danced towards the open church door, she saw an angel standing there. She was terrified, and wanted to fling off the red shoes, but they clung fast. She wanted to sit herself on the poor man’s grave, but for her there was neither peace nor rest. And she danced over the churchyard, but the dead did not dance--they had something better. Karen's shoes carried her through the gate into the fields, across roads and bridges, and she must keep ever dancing. One morning she danced past a door which she well knew. Within sounded a psalm; a coffin, decked with flowers, was borne forth. Then she knew that the old lady was dead, and felt that she was abandoned by all, and condemned by the angel of God. She was forced to dance through the gloomy night. She danced through the dark night, and through the day. She continued to dance, and her shoes took her to the end.. Karen danced over the heath till she came to a little house. She tapped with her fingers at the window, and said, ""Come out! Come out! I cannot come in, for I am forced to dance!"" The executioner struck off her feet with the red shoes, but the shoes danced away with the little feet across the field into the deep wood. He carved out little wooden feet for her, and crutches, taught her the psalm criminals always sing. She kissed the hand which had wielded the axe, and went over theHeath. The shoes carried her over stack and stone.. ""I really believe I am as good as many a one who sits in the church, and holds her head so high,"" said a young woman. ""Now I will go into the church that people may see me!"" she said. ""But when she was near it, the red shoes danced before her, and she was terrified, and turned round"" ""I have suffered and struggled enough,"" she said, ""and now I will do my best to help others."" ""I will do all that I can to help the poor, and the sick, and to help those who have been abandoned by their loved ones,"" she added. ""And I will try to help all those who are in need of help."". The following Sunday, when the family was going to church, they asked her whether she would not go with them. But she glanced sorrowfully, with tears in her eyes, at her crutches. The family went to hear the word of God; but she went alone into her little chamber. There was only room for a bed and chair to stand in it; and here she sat down with her Prayer-Book. While she read with a pious mind, the wind bore the strains of the organ towards her, and she raised her tearful countenance, and said, ""O God, help me!"" The sun shone so clearly, and straight before her stood the angel of God in white garments, the same. Karen's heart was so full of sunshine, peace, and joy, that it broke. Her soul flew on the sunshine to God, and there no one asked after the RED SHOES. She sat in the pew with the clergyman's family, and when they had ended the psalm and looked up, they nodded and said, ""It is right that thou art come!"" ""It was through mercy!"" she said. ""I am not ashamed to say that I am a woman of faith"""

The story of Cupid and Cupid is told by the storyteller, who is said to have been a boy of about eight. The story is told through the eyes of a young boy. The boy is described as 'pretty' and 'pale with cold' by the tale's author, who says he is 'terrified' of the cold.. The old poet was shot in the heart by a little boy who thought his bow was spoilt. The boy then ran away laughing. The poet lay on the floor crying. The little boy said: ""What a naughty boy to shoot the old poet like that"" The poet said: 'I was really shot in my heart'. Cupid is very deep, and deceives all the good children, both girls and boys. When the students come out of class, he walks beside them with a book under his arm, and wearing a black coat. They cannot recognize him. And then, if they take him by the arm, believing him to be a student too, he sticks an arrow into their chest. He sits in the large chandelier in the theatre and blazes away, so that people think it is. ""Oh! he is a bad boy, this Cupid, and you must never have anything to do with him, for he is after"

The sun was too strong for the people to stand in the sun all day. The people were forced to stay indoors.. In the warm lands every window has a balcony, and the people came out on all the balconies in the street. It was first towards evening when the sun was down, that they began to freshen up again. Tailors, and shoemakers, and all the. The learned foreigner lived in a house opposite to the one in which he lived. The door opposite was opened late in the evening, but it was dark within, at least in the front room. Further in there was heard the sound of music. The stranger's landlord said that he didn't know who had taken the house opposite, one saw no person about,. In general, it means the reddish-brown wood itself, but in jest, it signifies ""excessively fine"" The word comes from a Danish proverb, which refers to a splinter in the finger of a man.. The stranger sat out on the balcony. The light burnt in the room behind him; and thus it was quite natural that his shadow should fall on his opposite neighbor's wall. ""See, how nicely it sits between the flowers,"" said the learned man. ""I think my shadow is the only living thing one sees over there"". The stranger rose, and his shadow on the opposite neighbor's balcony rose also. The shadow went in through the half-open balcony-door of their opposite neighbor, just as the stranger went into his own room. The learned man went out to drink coffee and read the newspapers the next day.. Peter Schlemihl, the shadowless man. He made himself little; he made himself great: but no shadow came again. He said, ""Hem! hem!"" but it was of no use. After the lapse of eight days a new shadow came in the sunshine.. The learned man wrote books about what was true in the world. He was so well-off that he had a very fair shadow. The shadow grew so large that it was more than sufficient. The learned man then came home, and he wrote more books.. ""I cannot recover from my surprise!"" said the learned man. ""What is the meaning of all this?"" ""Something common, is it not,"" said the shadow. ""As soon as you found I was capable to go out alone in the world, I went my own way"". ""I never imagined that one's old shadow could come again as a man,"" said the learned man. ""I don't like to be in any sort of debt,"" replied the shadow. ""What debt is there to talk about? Make thyself as free as anyone else"". ""A word is a shadow,"" said the shadow, ""and as such it must speak"" ""I intend to get betrothed, for I can provide for more than one family"" ""Here is my hand --I promise it, and a man's bond is his word"". ""Do you know who lived in our opposite neighbor's house?"" said the shadow. ""It was the most charming of all beings, it was Poesy!"" ""Yes, yes, she often dwells a recluse in large cities!"" said the learned man.. ""I should have been completely killed if I had gone over to the maiden,"" he says. It is the custom in Denmark for intimate acquaintances to use the second person singular, ""Du,"" when speaking to each other. ""I certainly wish that you would say YOU* to me!"" he adds..

The princess was cured, but she still wanted to see her shadow.. The princess and the shadow danced together in the large ball-room. She was light, but he was still lighter; she had never had such a partner in the dance. She told him from what land she came, and he knew that land; he had been there, but. The princess thought of her country and kingdom, and of the many persons she would have to reign over. So she began, by degrees, to question him about the most difficult things she could think of, and which she herself could not have answered.. ""Oh! I like that!"" said the princess. ""What a man that must be who has so wise a shadow!"" thought she.. The princess and the shadow agreed that no one was to know about it before she arrived in her own kingdom. ""It will be a real.

One day he happened to find himself in the same washing-tub as a garter. “Mistress widow,” said the shirt- collar, “little mistress widow, I feel quite warm. I am changing, I am losing all my creases”. “You old rag,” said the flat-iron, driving proudly over the collar, for she fancied herself a steam-engine, which rolls over the railway and draws carriages. “Oh!” exclaimed the shirt-collar, “. The hair-brush was so angry that she cut too sharply into the shirt collar, and it was obliged to be thrown by as useless. “Engaged!” cried the shirtcollar, “now there is no one left to propose to;” and then he pretended to despise all love-making.. The shirt collar tells of his many love affairs. ""I shall never forget my first love,"" he says.

""Now let us see what we can do to amuse ourselves"" said the lady of the house. The conversation turned to the time of King Hans, and was only interrupted by the arrival of a journal that contained nothing worth reading. ""The time of the King Hans was the noblest and the most happy period."" said the Councillor. ""I am sure that you will agree with me that he was a very clever man."" said his hostess. ""He was a great man, and I am sure you will also agree with him."" ""He is a very good man, too, and he is very clever. He is a man of great intelligence and skill."" said a friend. ""And he is a good man of wit, too."". Two female figures, a young and an old one, were sitting together. The younger was not Dame Fortune herself, but one of the waiting-maids of her handmaidens. The other looked extremely gloomy--it was Care. They were telling each other, with a confidential interchange of ideas, where they had been during the day. The messenger of Fortune had only executed a few unimportant commissions, such as saving a new bonnet from a shower of rain, etc.; but what she had yet to perform was something quite unusual.""I must tell you,"" said she, ""that to-day is my birthday; and in honor of it, a pair of walking-shoes or galoshes has been entrusted to me, which I am to carry to mankind"" The story was told in the play ""The Fairies"" by the English playwright Edward St Aubyn.. ""Do you seriously believe it?"" replied Care, in a severe tone of reproach. ""No; he will be very unhappy, and will assuredly bless the moment when he feels that he has freed himself from the fatal shoes"" ""Stupid nonsense!"" said the other angrily. ""I will put them here by the door. Some one will make a mistake for certain and take the wrong ones--he will be a happy man"" ""I am not a man, I am a woman,"" replied Care.

""Do you like me?"" ""Yes, I do,"" said Care. ""Well! This is too bad! How dirty it is here!"" sighed the Councillor.

The Councillor stood still, and watched a most strange procession pass by. First came a dozen drummers, who understood pretty well how to handle their instruments. Then came halberdiers, and some armed with cross-bows. The principal person in the procession was a priest. The good folks come probably from a masquerade!"" said the Counciller. The Councillors' Council was dissolved on the day of the Feast of the Nativity. The Council was re-constituted on the same day. The council was also re-created on the following day, the day after the Feast. The councillors' council was called the Council of the New Order. The new council was made up of seven members, and the first was elected on the first day of October.. The Bishop of Zealand was considered the most absent man in the whole kingdom, and people told the drollest anecdotes about him. The Councillor went through East Street and across the Habro-Platz. The bridge leading to Palace Square was not to be found. The nocturnal wanderer discovered a shallow piece of water, and here fell in with two men who very comfortably were rocking to and fro in a boat. ""Does your honor want to cross the ferry to the Holme?"" asked they. ""Across to the holme!"" said the Councillors. ""That's the Bishop of New Zealand,"" was the answer. ""Good Heavens! What has taken possession of the Bishop?"" sighed the councillor.. The longer he spoke with the boatmen, the more unintelligible did their language become to him. ""I don't understand your Bornholmish dialect,"" said he at last, angrily, and turning his back upon them. He was unable to find the bridge: there was no railway either. ""It is really disgraceful what a state this place is in,"" muttered he to himself. Never had his age, with which, however, he was always grumbling, seemed so miserable as on this evening. ""No, I am going to Christianshafen, to Little Market Street."". ""I must go back to the New Market; there, it is to be hoped, I shall find some coaches,"" he said. But where were the coaches? ""Not one was to be seen,"" he replied. ""What wooden scaffolding is that which they have set up there?"" he asked himself. ""It is a huge desolate plain,"" he added, ""and across the field flowed a broad canal or river"" He was referring to the city's New Market, which was at the end of East Street. ""I was going to go there, but I could not find it,"" he continued. ""There were no coaches there."". ""I either behold a fata morgana, or I am regularly tipsy,"" whimpered out the Councillor. He turned round anew, firmly convinced that he was seriously ill. ""No--I am far from well,"" sighed he; ""and yet I drank only one glass of punch."" ""It was, too, really very wrong to give us punch and hot salmon for supper,"" he said. ""I shall speak about it at the first opportunity"" ""I have half a mind to go back again, and say what I suffer,"" he added. ""But what's this?"" ""I cannot suppose it,"" he replied. ""It's a very strange place."". ""It is really dreadful,"" groaned he with increasing anxiety; ""I cannot recognise East Street again"" He looked for the house, but it had vanished. He now hit upon a half-open door, through a chink of which a faint light shone. It was a sort of hostelry of those times; a kind of public-house. ""At all events here are some people up and stirring. Oh! oh! I am certainly very ill."" ""I can scarcely bear myself any longer. Where the deuce can the house be? It must be here on this very spot"" ""It is a sort-of hostelries of those days; a sort - of public house"". The Councillor asked the Hostess to send for a hackney-coach to take him to Christianshafen. The woman examined him with eyes of astonishment, and shook her head; she then addressed him in German. This strengthened the good woman in the belief that he was a foreigner. This, in connection with his costume, strengthened the woman's belief. That is how he ended up in the church of the Holy Cross. The Church of the Sacred Cross was built in the 12th century. It is located in the centre of Copenhagen.. The Councillor supported his head on his hand, drew a long breath, and thought over all the wondrous things he saw around him. He asked mechanically, as he saw the Hostess push aside a large sheet of paper. It was a coarse wood-cut, representing a splendid meteor ""as seen in the town of Cologne,"" which was to be read below in bright letters. ""Pray how did you come into possession of this rare print? It is extremely interesting, although the whole is a mere fable,"" said the Councillors' Hostess. ""That is very old!"" said the councillor, who began to make considerably more cheerful after seeing the piece of antiquity.. ""Such meteorous appearances are to be explained in this way--that they are the reflections of the Aurora Borealis, and it is highly probable they are caused principally by electricity"" ""I am a Bachelor in Theologia,"" answered the Councillor with a stiff reverence. ""I must say mihi secus videtur: yet I am willing to suspend my judicium."" ""I can only join in conversation on this topic and on that, as indeed one must do according to the demands of the world at present."" ""Modestia is a fine virtue,"" continued the gentleman. ""however, as to your speech, I must sayMihi Secus vidsetur"". ""This is no locus docendi, it is true,"" began the clerical gentleman. ""yet I beg you earnestly to let us profit by your learning"" ""Oh yes, I've read something, to be sure,"" replied the Councillor. ""I like reading all useful works; but I do not on that account despise the modern ones"" ""Tales of Every-day Life"" that I cannot bear--we have enough and more than enough such in reality"" ""I mean those new fangled novels, twisting and writhing themselves in the dust of commonplace, which also expect to find a reading public"". The King likes the history of Sir Iffven and Sir Gaudian particularly, which treats of King Arthur, and his Knights of the Round Table. The King has more than once joked about it with his high vassals. Heiberg was the first printer that appeared in Denmark. The king's son, Hans, was a great scholar. He was also a great poet. He wrote a number of books, including a novel about King Arthur. He also wrote a series of short stories about the king. He died in 1484. The son, Peter, was the son of Hans, the king's grandson. He lived until 1487.. The Councillor imagined it was the cholera that was meant, which people made so much fuss about. With other topics he was not so fortunate; every moment brought about some new confusion, and threatened to become a perfect Babel. The worthy Bachelor was really too ignorant, and the simplest observations of the Councillors sounded to him too daring and phantastical. He agreed entirely with the others in abusing the rascally English. The Herostratic* event of 1801 still floated vividly, and he still remembered it.. The Bachelor was talking to a Councillor, when he suddenly felt dizzy. He had forgotten all that had preceded it. ""Let us drink claret and mead, and Bremen beer,"" shouted one of the guests. ""And you shall drink with us!"" said the Councillors. ""Merciful God, where am I!"" exclaimed the Bachelor in agony. ""What's the matter?"" asked the Hostess. ""I've forgotten all of it,"" said the Bachelor. ""It's all a dream!"" replied the Hostesses. ""But it's not a dream at all,"" replied the Bachelor, ""it's a nightmare."" ""It is a nightmare,"" said he, ""but it's a good one."" ""I can't believe I'm still alive,"" said she, ""and I can't. ""What's to be the end of this! What's to become of me!"" groaned the Councillor. They poured out the liquor, and made the most friendly gesticulations. ""It is the most dreadful moment of my life: the whole world is leagued against me!"" he thought. But suddenly it occurred to him that he might stoop down under the table, and then creep unobserved out of the door. ""Never before, he thought, had he been in such a coarse and ignorant company;"" he said. ""One might almost fancy the people had turned heathens again"" ""I am a man of the people,"" he said, ""and I am not ashamed of it."". The Councillor saw quite distinctly before him a lantern burning, and behind this a large handsome house. He lay with his feet towards a doorway, and exactly opposite sat the watchman asleep. ""Gracious Heaven!"" said he. ""Have I lain here in the street and dreamed? Yes; 'tis East Street! How splendid and light it is! But really it is terrible what an effect that one glass of punch must have had on me!"" Two minutes later, he was sitting in a hackney-coach and driving to Frederickshafen. ""It is terrible how an effect a glass of drink must haveHad on me"". The Watchman's Adventure. The Watchman was a man who had suffered much in his own time. He found a pair of galoshes near the door of the lieutenant's house. The worthy man was inclined to ring and deliver them at the house, for there was still a light in the window. But he did not like disturbing the other people in their beds, and so very considerately he left the matter alone. He thought of the distress and agony he had endured, and praised from the very bottom of his heart the happy reality--our own time--which, with all its deficiencies, is yet much better than that in which, so much against his inclination, he had lately been.III. The. The watchman entered into the being and nature of the lieutenant. He stood in the handsomely furnished apartment, and held between his fingers a small sheet of rose-colored paper, on which some verses were written. ""There is the lieutenant, now, who might go quietly to bed if he chose, where no doubt he could stretch himself at his ease; but does he do it?"" he asked. ""Would to Heaven I could but change with him! How happy should I be!"" The watchman said, ""If one then marks down one's thoughts, poetry is produced"" He then went on to describe the life of the officer, and how he had become a man of the people. The story was told in a book called ""The Watchman,"" published in London in 1881.. ""Oh, were I rich! Such was my wish, yea such When hardly three feet high, I longed for much"" ""Oh, poor me! Have pity, Thou, who all man's wants dost see"" ""I sat one evening sunk in dreams of bliss, A maid of seven years old gave me a kiss"" ""Then was I rich, but not in gold,poor me! As Thou dost know, whoall men's hearts canst see."" ""I at that time was rich in poesy And tales of old, though poor as poor could be"" ""A tale of old"" is a poem written by the French poet Jean-Michel Cousteau in the early 1800s.. ""Such verses as these people write when they are in love!

""He has a home, a wife, and children, who weep with him over his sorrows"" The watchman was again watchman. The officer felt himself in his new situation much less contented, and now preferred the very thing which but some minutes before he had rejected. It was the shoes that caused the metamorphosis by means of which, unknown to himself, he took upon him the thoughts and feelings of the officer, as we have just seen. The lieutenant, love, and lack of money--that is a symbolic triangle, or much the same as the half of the shattered die of Fortune.. ""That was an unpleasant dream,"" said he; ""but 'twas droll enough altogether. I fancied that I was the lieutenant over there: and yet the thing was not very much to my taste after all"" ""There falls another star,"" said the watchman, ""but what does it matter; there are always enough left"" ""I should not much mind examining the little glimmering things somewhat nearer, especially the moon,"" he said. ""That would not slip so easily through a man's fingers"" ""We shall fly about as light as a feather from one such a star to the other,"" he added, ""when we die"" ""That's, of course, not true: but 'twould be pretty enough if it were so"" ""So then the watch man was again watchman.. ""If I could but once take a leap up there, my body might stay here on the steps for what I care,"" said the watchman. ""Death is an electric shock which our heart receives,"" said Mr. Twain. ""The freed soul soars upwards on the wings of electricity,"" he said. ""We all know the speed produced by the employment of steam,"" he added. ""But such a flight is like the travelling of a sloth in comparison with the velocity with which light moves"" ""The sun's light wants eight minutes and some seconds to perform a journey of more than twenty million of our Danish* miles,"" he wrote. ""B borne by electricity, the soul wants even some minutes less to accomplish the same flight"" ""We are all in this together,"" said Mrs. Twain, ""and we are all going to die,"" she said, ""but. The moon is formed out of matter much lighter than our earth. A Danish mile is nearly 4 3/4 English miles. The moon's appearance we can, in some measure, realize to ourselves by beating the white of an egg in a glass of water. We can't go to the moon unless, like the Shoes of Fortune, we happen to have on the Moon's shoes. We cannot go to it unless we have the moon's shoes on. We are not allowed to go to heaven. We must go to hell. We have to go back to earth. We will go to earth if we want to. We shall go to our home planet. We won't go there if we don't have the shoes on the moon. We don't want to go there. We want to see the moon, not the moon itself.. He perceived immediately a quantity of beings who were certainly what we call ""men""; yet they looked different to us. The matter of which it was built was just as soft, and formed similar towers, and domes, and rocking in the thin air.

They are not like us, and we have our own way."" ""They are not of this world; they are of the world."" ""We are not the world; we are not. The author is a writer, poet and playwright.

They considered the moon alone to be inhabited: they imagined it was the real heart of the universe or planetary system, on which the genuine Cosmopolites, or citizens of the world, dwelt. When the watchman gave no reply, the merry roysterer, who was now returning home from a noisy drinking bout, took it into his head to try what a tweak of the nose would do. The body lay motionless, stretched out on the pavement: the man was dead. What strange things men--no, what strange things Selenite sometimes take into their heads! It was a strange thing to see. It was the strangest thing to hear.. The body of the seemingly dead man was carried to the viewing-room. The spirit of the man returned with the quickness of lightning to its earthly tenement. The body only makes it stupid, says the author. The man's spirit was the one who found the body, and returned it to its rightful place. It was the body that made the body stupid, the author says. The writer says the body is the one that makes the soul stupid. It is the soul that shakes off every fetter, and every sort of leading-string. The soul is shrewdest when it shakes it off, the writer says. It's a very pretty joke, if the spirit were not to find the body. The finder will be handsomely rewarded, the novelist adds. The story is told in a book called ""Hue and Cry,"" published in 1881.. The same day he was discharged from the hospital as perfectly cured. He asserted that the preceding night had been the worst that ever the malice of fate had allotted him. He would not for two silver marks again go through what he had endured while moon-stricken. The part of the body most difficult to manage on such occasions was, no doubt, the head; here, as is so often the case in the world, long-headed people get through best. The extensive building is separated from the street by a pretty high railing, the thick iron bars of which are so far apart, that in all seriousness, it is said, some very thin fellow had of a night occasionally squeezed himself through to go and pay his little visits in the town.

""IT is so delightfully cold,"" said the Snow Man, ""that it makes my whole body crackle"". ""Away, away,"" barked the old yard-dog. ""The sun will make you run some day. I saw him, last winter, make your predecessor run, and his predecessor before him"" ""I don't understand you, comrade,"" said the Snow Man. ""Is. ""I have a feeling that he is talking of something very disagreeable,"" said the Snow Man. ""I can feel such pricks and stabs in my left leg; I am sure there is going to be a change"". The Snow Man is a snowman who lives in a garden in the middle of summer. The snow is covered with diamonds, from which countless lights gleam. The Snow Man's appearance is wondrously beautiful. The many delicate forms concealed in summer by luxuriant foliage, were now clearly defined, and looked. The Snow Man asked the yard-dog: ""Who are these two?"" ""They are lovers,"" he replied. ""They will go and live in the same kennel by-and-by, and gnaw at the same bone"". ""Away, away!"" barked the yard-dog. ""I was a pretty little fellow once"" ""The cold is delightful,"" said the Snow Man. ""Only you must not clank your chain so"" ""I received quite as good food, or even better"". The Snow Man looked at a stove and felt a strange sensation come over him. He knew not what it meant, and he could not account for it. But there are people who are not men of snow, who understand what it is. The Snow Man felt quite a strange sensations come over he.. The Snow Man asked the yard-dog why he had left the housekeeper. The dog replied that he had been chained up after biting a boy who kicked away his bone. The Snow Man then looked into the room where the stove stood on its four iron legs, looking about the same size as the Snow Man himself.. The Snow Man stood looking in through the window, and in the twilight hour the room became still more inviting. From the stove came a gentle glow, not like the sun or the moon; no, only the bright light which gleams from a stove when it has been well fed. The light of the flames fell directly on the face and breast. The Snow Man was sick with ""stove sick"" He could see nothing of the stove, which he pictured to himself, as if it had been a lovely human being. He said nothing and made no complaint, which is a sure sign. As the warmth increased, the Snow Man decreased. One morning he sank down altogether.. ""Ah, now I understand why he had such a great longing for the stove,"" said the yard-dog. ""Why, there's"
0.86,0.96,69.68946151304922,"The Treats of a Mirror and of the Splinters. The most beautiful landscapes looked like boiled spinach, and the best persons were turned into frights, or appeared to stand on their heads. If anyone had a mole, you might be sure that it would be magnified and spread over both nose and mouth. If a good thought passed through a man's mind, then a grin was seen in the mirror, and a sprite laughed heartily at his clever discovery. When we are at the end of the story, we shall know more than we know now: but to begin with, we must know what the Mirror is for. The Mirror is a Mirror. The Splinters are a Mirror, a Mirror is the Splinter, a Splinter is a Splinters, and so on. We must know more about the Mirror.. The sprite school was founded by a man who had a mirror in his room. He and his fellow sprites thought it would be possible to see how the world really looked. So they ran about with the mirror, and at last there was not a land or a person who was not represented distorted in the mirror. So then they thought they would fly up to the sky, and have a joke there. The higher they flew with the Mirror, the more terribly it grinned. Higher and higher still they flew, nearer and nearer to the stars, when suddenly the mirror shook so terribly with grinning, that it flew out of their hands and fell to the earth, where it was dashed in a hundred million and more pieces. Some of these pieces were hardly so large as a grain of sand, and they flew about in the wide world, and when they got into people's eyes, there they stayed. This happened because the very smallest bit had the same power which the whole mirror had possessed.. Some of the broken pieces were so large that they were used for windowpanes, through which one could not see one's friends. Some persons even got a splinter in their heart, and then it made one shudder, for their heart became like a lump of ice. Then the wicked sprite laughed till he almost choked, for all this tickled his fancy. The fine splinters still flew about in the air: and now we shall hear what happened next. A Little Boy and a Little Girl in a Large Town. They were not brother and sister; but they cared for each other as much as if they were. Their parents lived exactly opposite. They had a garden somewhat larger than a flower-pot. They lived in a large town, where there are so many houses, and so many people, that there is no roof left for everybody to have a little garden.. The children's parents had large wooden boxes there, in which vegetables for the kitchen were planted, and little rosetrees besides. There was a rose in each box, and they grew splendidly. They now thought of placing the boxes across the gutter, so that they nearly reached from one window to the other, and looked just like two walls of flowers. The tendrils of the peas hung down over the boxes; and the rose-trees shot up long branches, twined round the windows, and then bent towards each other. It was almost like a triumphant arch of foliage and flowers. In winter there was an end of this pleasure. The children knew that they must not creep over them; so they often obtained permission to get out of the windows to each other and to sit on their little stools among the roses, where they could play delightfully.. The windows were often frozen over, but then they heated copper farthings on the stove, and laid the hot farthing on the windowpane. Out of each peeped a gentle friendly eye--it was the little boy and the little girl who were looking out. His name was Kay, hers was Gerda. In summer, with one jump, they could get to each other; but in winter they were obliged first to go down the long stairs, and then up theLong stairs again. and out-of-doors there was quite a snow-storm. The little boy asked his grandmother, ""Do the white bees choose a queen?"" ""Yes,"" said the grandmother, 'she flies where the swarm hangs in the thickest clusters'. ""Many a winter's night she flies through the streets of the town, and peeps in at the windows,"" said the little girl. ""Then I'd put her on the stove, and she'd melt,"" replied the little boy. ""And then his grandmother patted his head and told him other stories"" ""I have seen it,"" said both the children, ""and so they knew that it was true"" ""And so they know that it is true,"" said his grandmother, ""that she is the Snow Queen"" ""Yes, I have. seen it. and so they have known that it's true,"" he said. ""I've seen it, and so have they."" ""And they know it. They know it."". The little boy was frightened, and jumped down from the chair. It seemed to him as if, at the same moment, a large bird flew past the window. The next day it was a sharp frost--and then the spring came. The sun shone, the green leaves appeared, the swallows built their nests, and the windows were opened. That summer the roses flowered in unwonted beauty. The little children again sat in their pretty garden, high up on the leads at the top of the house. The boy was afraid, but then he saw the little girl looking. The little girl had learned a hymn, in which there was something about roses. She then sang the verse to the little boy, who then sang it with her. The children held each other by the hand, kissed the roses, looked up at the clear sunshine, and spoke as though they really saw angels there. Kay said, ""Oh! I feel such a sharp pain in my heart; and now something has got into my eye!"" The little girl put her arms around his neck. He winked his eyes; now there was nothing to be seen. The clock in the church-tower was just striking five--that Kay said,. ""Oh, I feel like I've got a fever!"" The clock was striking five; but it was not a fever.. ""What are you crying for?"" he asks. ""There's nothing the matter with me"" ""It will soon become like ice,"" he says. ""It did not hurt any longer, but there it was. It was just one of those pieces of glass"". ""What are you doing?"" cried the little girl. He pulled up another rose, got in at the window, and hastened off from dear little Gerda. Afterwards, when she brought her picture-book, he asked, ""What horrid beasts have you there?"" And if his grandmother told them stories, he always interrupted her. He would get behind her, put on her spectacles, and imitate her way of speaking. He copied all her ways, and then everybody laughed at him. He was soon able to imitate the gait and manner of everyone in the street. And then he gave the box a good kick with his foot.. ""Look through this glass, Gerda,"" said he. And every flake seemed larger, and appeared like a magnificent flower, or beautiful star. ""Look, how clever!"" said Kay. ""The boy is certainly very clever!"" But it was the glass he had got in his eye; the glass that was sticking in his heart, which made him tease even little Gerda, whose whole soul was devoted to him. ""Every flake of snow seemed larger and appearedlike a magnificent flowers, or a beautiful star; it was splendid to look at!"". It was not long after this, that Kay came one day with large gloves on, and his little sledge at his back, and bawled right into Gerda's ears, ""I have permission to go out into the square where the others are playing""; and off he was in a moment. ""That's much more interesting than real flowers! They are as exact as possible; there is not a fault in them, if they did not melt!"" he said. The sledge drove round the square twice, and Kay tied on his sledge as quickly as he could, andoff he drove with it. It was so capital! Just as they were in the very height of their amusement, a large sledge passed by: it was painted quite white, and there was someone in it wrapped up in a rough white. The snow-flakes grew larger and larger, till at last they looked just like great white fowls. On they went quicker and quicker into the next street. The person who drove turned round to Kay, and nodded to him in a friendly manner. He was quite frightened, and he tried to repeat the Lord's Prayer. But all he could do, he was only able to remember the multiplication table. The snow drifted and the sledge flew on, and sometimes it gave a jerk as though they were driving over hedges and ditches. The little boy cried as loud as he could, but no one heard him. He could not see an arm's length before him, but still on he went. When suddenly he let go the string he held in his hand in order to get loose from the sledge, but it was of no use. Still the little vehicle rushed on with the quickness of the wind.. ""We have travelled fast,"" said she; ""but it is freezingly cold. Come under my bearskin."" And she put him in the sledge beside her, wrapped the fur round him. He felt as though he were sinking in a snow-wreath. ""My sledge! Do not forget my sledge!"" It was the first thing he thought of. It was there tied to one of the white chickens, who flew along with it on his back behind the large sledge. ""Do not forget your sledge,"" said the Snow Queen. ""It is the only thing that can keep you warm."" ""Do you want to go home?"" he asked. ""Yes,"" she said. ""I want to see my children."" ""I will go with you,"" he said.. Kay looked at her. She was very beautiful; a more clever, or a more lovely countenance he could not fancy to himself. The Snow Queen kissed Kay once more, and then he forgot little Gerda, grandmother, and all whom he had left at his home. He flew with her over the black clouds, while the storm moaned and whistled as though it were singing some old tune. It then seemed to him as if what he knew was not enough, and he looked upwards in the large huge empty space above him, and on she flew with him. He did not fear her at all, and told her that he could calculate in his head and with fractions, even; that he knew the number of square miles there were in the different countries, and how many inhabitants they contained.. The Snow Queen slept at the feet of the Snow Queen during the long long winter's night. The boys saw him tie his sledge to another large and splendid one, which drove down the street and out of the town. Nobody knew where he was; many sad tears were shed, and little Gerda wept long and bitterly. At last she said he must be dead; that he had been drowned in the river which flowed close to the town, and that he was dead. The story of the Flower-Garden At the Old Woman's Who Understood Witchcraft. The Snow Queen's Garden. The Story of The Flower Garden At The Old Woman’s Who Understands Witchcraft, by C.S. Lewis.. ""Kay is dead and gone!"" said little Gerda to the Swallows. ""That I don't believe,"" said the Sunshine. ""I will make you a present of my red shoes, if you will give him back to me"" ""I'll put on my red Shoes,"" said she, one morning. ""Kay has never seen them, and then I'll go down to the river and ask there"" ""And, as it seemed to her, the blue waves nodded in a strange manner,"" said Gerda, ""and she threw them both into the river"" ""Oh! those were very long and dismal winter evenings!"" said the Swallow. ""And at last little GerDA did not think so any longer either."". Gerda thought that she had not thrown the shoes out far enough, so she clambered into a boat which lay among the rushes, went to the farthest end, and threw out the shoes. But the boat was not fastened, and the motion which she occasioned, made it drift from the shore. But they fell close to the bank, and little waves bore them immediately to land.. Little Gerda was very frightened, and began to cry; but no one heard her except the sparrows, and they could not carry her to land. She observed this, and hastened to get back; but before she could do so, the boat was more than a yard from the land, and was gliding quickly onward. The banks on both sides were beautiful; lovely flowers, venerable trees, and slopes with sheep and cows, but not a human being was to be seen. ""Perhaps the river will carry me to little Kay,"" said she; and then she grew less sad. She rose, and looked for many hours at the beautiful green banks. ""I have been looking for you all my life,"" she said, ""and. Gerda sailed by a large cherry-orchard, where was a little cottage with curious red and blue windows. Before it two wooden soldiers stood sentry, and presented arms when anyone went past. Gerda called to them, for she thought they were alive, but they did not answer. She called still louder, and an old woman then came out of the cottage. She had a large broad-brimmed hat on, painted with the most splendid flowers.. ""How did you get upon the large rapid river, to be driven about so in the wide world?"" asked the old woman. ""A-hem! a-hem!"" said Gerda. The woman told her not to be cast down, but taste her cherries, and look at her flowers, which were finer than any in a picture-book, each of which could tell a whole story. Gerda was so glad to be on dry land again; but she was rather afraid of the strange old woman, who was very kind. ""But come and tell me who you are, and how you came here,"" said she. ""And Gerda told her all;"" and when Gerda had told her everything, and asked her if she had. The windows were very high up; the glass was red, blue, and green. On the table stood the most exquisite cherries, and Gerda ate as many as she chose. While she was eating, the old woman combed her hair with a golden comb, and her hair curled and shone with a lovely golden color around that sweet little face, which was so round and so like a rose. ""Now you shall see how well we agree together,"" she said. ""I have often longed for such a dear little girl,"" she added. ""And now I want very much to keep little Gerda."" ""I want to keep Gerda,"" she replied. ""Yes, I do,"" said the woman, ""and I will keep her."". Gerda knew every flower; and, numerous as they were, it still seemed to Gerda that one was wanting, though she did not know which one. Gerda jumped for joy, and played till the sun set behind the tall cherry-tree. She then had a pretty bed, with a red silken coverlet filled with blue violets. She fell asleep, and had as pleasant dreams as ever a queen on her wedding-day. The next morning she went to play with the flowers in the warm sunshine, and thus passed away a day. The story of Gerda and Kay is told in the novel, The Secret of the Rose. The book is published by Chatto & Windus, and is available in paperback and hardback. For more information on the book, or to order a copy, visit www.chattoandwindus.com.. Gerda was looking at the hat of the old woman painted with flowers. The most beautiful of them all seemed to her to be a rose. The old woman had forgotten to take it from her hat when she made the others vanish in the earth. Gerda kissed the roses, thought of her own dear roses at home, and with them of little Kay. She then sat down and wept; but her hot tears fell just where a rose-bush had sunk. When her warm tears watered the ground, the tree shot up suddenly as fresh and blooming as when it had been swallowed up. ""Oh, how long I have stayed!"" said the little girl. ""I intended to look for Kay! Don't you know where he is?"" she asked of the roses. ""Dead he certainly is not,"" said the Roses.. ""Many thanks!"" said little Gerda. ""We have been in the earth where all the dead are, but Kay was not there."" ""Hearest thou not the drum? Bum! Bum!"" said the Tiger-Lily. ""Hark to the plaintive song of the old woman, to the call of the priests!"" ""The fire of whose eyes pierces her heart more than the flames which soon will burn her body to ashes?"" said the Hindoo woman in her long robe. ""What did the Tiger Lily say?"" asked the little girl. ""Bum!"" she said. ""Always bum!"" ""What does the tiger Lily think?"" asked Gerda, ""What do you think, Gerda?"". ""I don't understand that at all,"" said little Gerda. ""That is my story,"" said the Lily. ""I am speaking about my story--about my dream,"" answered the Convolvulus. ""Can the heart's flame die in the flame of the funeral pile?"" asked the Snowdrops. ""Yes,"" replied the Lily, ""but it is not the same thing."" ""What did the Snowdrop say?"" asked little GerDA. ""She said, 'Is he not yet come?'"" ""No,"" said Gerda, ""he is not coming at all."". ""There were once upon a time three sisters, quite transparent, and very beautiful"" ""A swing, a bursting bubble--such is my song!"" ""What you relate may be very pretty, but you tell it in so melancholy a manner, and do not mention Kay"" ""What do the Hyacinths say?"" ""They say that the world is a very beautiful place"" ""And what do they say about the world?"" ""That it is very beautiful?"" ""I don't know,"" says the author. ""I just think it's a very pretty place."" ""What are the HyACinths saying?"" ""The world is quite a beautiful place,"" replies the author, ""and they say that it is a lot of fun."" ""But what about the people?"" ""Who are the people? What do they think?"" ""What does the Hy. Three lovely maidens, glided out of the forest and across the lake. The robe of the one was red, the second blue, and the third white. Do the dancing maidens sleep, or are they dead? The odour of the flowers says they are corpses; the evening bell tolls for the dead!"" ""You make me quite sad,"" said little Gerda. ""I cannot help thinking of the dead maidens"" ""The Roses have been in the earth, and they say no."" ""We do not toll for little Kay; we do not know him"" ""We are not afraid of death. We are not scared of life."". Gerda went to the Ranunculuses, that looked forth from among the shining green leaves. ""Tell me if you know where I can find my playfellow,"" said Gerda. ""That is our way of singing, the only one we have,"" said the RanUnculus. ""My poor old grandmother!"" sighed Gerda, ""Yes, she is longing for me, no doubt: she is sorrowing for me"" ""There was gold, pure virgin gold in that blessed kiss. There, that is my little story,"" saidthe Ranunculus. 'There is a story to be told,' said the child, 'but it is not about Kay' 'I will tell it to you when I have had a chance,' said Kay, 'and I will say it in my heart'. ""I can see myself--I cansee myself! Oh, how odorous I am! Up in the little garret there stands, half-dressed, a little Dancer. She stands now on one leg, now on both; she despises the whole world; yet she lives only in imagination"" ""I will soon come home, and then I will bring Kay with me. It is of no use asking the flowers; they only know their own old rhymes, and can tell me nothing."" ""I can't help it. I'm a dancer. I can't stop myself!"" ""I'm a Dancer!"" ""Yes, you can. You can."" ""You're a dancer, too. You're a little dancer. You've got to stop yourself."". ""That's nothing to me,"" said little Gerda. ""That does not concern me."" And then off she ran to the further end of the garden. The gate was locked, but she shook the rusted bolt till it was loosened, and the gate opened. She looked round her thrice, but no one followed her. At last she could run no longer; she sat down on a large stone, and when she looked about her, she saw that the summer had passed. ""Dear me, how long I have staid!"" said Gerda, ""Autumn is come"" ""I can see myself--I cansee myself!"" said the girl.. Gerda was obliged to rest herself again, when, exactly opposite to her, a large Raven came hopping over the white snow. He had long been looking at Gerda and shaking his head; and now he said, ""Caw! Caw!"" He could not say it better; but he felt a sympathy for the little girl, and asked her where she was going all alone. ""I must not rest any longer,"" said Gerda, ""and I must go further"" ""Good day! Good day!"" said the Raven. ""Good Day!"" said GerDA. ""And I will go further."". Gerda told the Raven her whole history, and asked if he had not seen Kay. The word ""alone"" Gerda understood quite well, and felt how much was expressed by it. ""I think I know; I think that it may be little Kay,"" said the Raven. But now he has forgotten you for the Princess, said Gerda. ""It may be--it may be!"" said the raven. ""Yes--listen,"" said GerDA, ""but it will be difficult for me to speak your language"" ""If you understand the Raven language I can tell you better,"" said Raven. ""No, I have not learnt it. ""No matter,"" said the Raven; ""I will tell you as well as I can; however, it will be bad enough"" And then he told all he knew. ""I wish I had learnt it."" ""I have read all the newspapers in the whole world, and has forgotten them again"" ""No matter"" ""It is not very amusing after all"" ""I am not a man, I am a woman"" ""You are not a woman, you are a man"" ""What do you want from me?"" ""I want to know what you want"" ""Why should I not be married?"" ""Oh, why should I be?"" ""Because I want to marry you"". ""Yes, Yes,"" said the Raven, ""you may believe it; it is as true as I am sitting here"" The newspapers appeared forthwith with a border of hearts and the initials of the Princess. People came in crowds; there was a crush and a hurry, but no one was successful either on the first or second day. ""You may believe every word I say,"" says the Raven; ""for I have a tame sweetheart that hops about in the palace quite free"" ""Yes, yes,"" says The Raven. ""I am sure you will believe me."" ""Yes. I am certain you will."" ""You will believe it."" ""No, you will not."" ""I have a very good reason for it."". ""There was a whole row of them standing from the town-gates to the palace. I was there myself to look,"" said the Raven.

""Then--oh, then--they could chatter enough. There was no end to their chatter."" ""They could all talk well enough when they were out in the street;"" he said, ""but as soon as they came inside the palace gates, and saw the guard richly dressed in silver, and the lackeys. ""That was Kay,"" cried Gerda, with a voice of delight. ""He had beautiful long hair, but his clothes were very shabby"" ""Patience, patience; we are just come to him,"" said Gerda.

A knocking was heard at the door, and in came a poor old man wrapped up as in a large horse-cloth, for it warms one, and he needed it, as it was the cold winter season.. ""Our Lord will not take him from. ""What is that?"" said the mother. ""The old man was gone, and her little child was gone"" ""Oh, only tell me which way he went!"" said the woman. ""He goes faster than the wind, and he never brings back what he takes"". ""I know it!"" said the woman in the black clothes. ""Tell me the way, and I shall find him!"" ""But before I tell it, thou. The mother wept as she watched her child die. She sang and wept, and there were many songs, but yet many more tears. Night said, ""Go to the right, into the dark pine forest; thither I saw Death take. ""I am freezing to death; I shall become a lump of ice!"" she said. But the thornbush shot forth fresh green leaves, and there came flowers on it in the cold winter night. ""He is merciful, and you will also be so! Where shall I find my little child?"". ""I have nothing to give,"" said the afflicted mother, ""but I will go to the world's end for you!"" ""But you can give me your long black hair; you know yourself that it is fine, and that I like!"" ""You shall have my white hair instead, andThat's always something!"". The mother of a little boy saw a little blue crocus, that hung quite sickly on one side. She told him not to touch it, but to threaten him that he would do the same with all the others. The little crocus was so sickly that it had to be nursed by the mother. She heard within it how the. The blind mother could feel that it was Death that came. She held her hands fast around his, so tight, and yet afraid that she should touch one of the leaves. Then Death blew on her hands, and she felt that she was colder than the cold wind.. ""Give me back my child!"" said the mother, and she wept and prayed. At once she seized hold of two beautiful flowers close by, with each hand, and cried out to Death, ""I will tear all thy flowers off, for I am in despair"" ""Touch. ""Take them again, they are now brighter than before,"" she says. ""Now look down into the deep well close by,"" she adds. ""See what thou. ""Which of them is Misfortune's flower and which is that of Happiness?"" asked she. ""Both of them are God's will!"" said Death. And she saw the other's life, and it was sorrow and distress, horror,. ""Wilt thou have thy child again, or shall I go with it there, where thou dost not know?"" ""Oh, hear"
0.78,0.88,65.75087310826542,"The Wind tells how he knew the family of Waldemar Daa. The house was once part of the castle of Marck Stig on the promontory. But the castle was obliged to be pulled down, and the stone was used again for the walls of a new mansion on another spot. The baronial residence of Borreby, which still stands near the coast, is the subject of this tale. The Wind says he knows every stone of it, says the Wind, and knows the family well. He also tells of the noble lords and ladies of the successive generations that dwelt there, and of their despotic rule. The story ends with the death of the last of the family, who died at the age of 80. The wind says he will return to the land of his birth to tell you more of the story.. The Wind tells the story of a noble family in Borreby, Denmark. They had three children, daughters, fair and delicate maidens. They were a rich, noble family, born in affluence and nurtured in luxury. Stranger guests came from far and near, music sounded, goblets clashed, and I, said the Wind, was not able to drown the noise. It was Live and let live, here. The Wind says. The story ends with the Wind telling the tale of the family.. The Wind came from the west, and had seen the ships overpowered with the waves, when all on board persisted or were cast shipwrecked on the coast of Jutland. The young men of the neighborhood were collecting branches and brushwood under the oak-trees. The largest and dryest they could find they piled them up in a heap and set them on fire. Then the men and maidens danced, and sung in a circle round the blazing pile. I lay quite quiet, said the Wind, but I silently touched a branch which had been brought by one of the handsomest of the young men, and the wood blazed up brightly, blazed brighter than all the rest. The Wind said: ""I am the Wind. I am the God of the World. And I am not afraid."". Waldemar Daa was a young man in a rich baronial house. He saw a noble lady drive by with her three daughters. The daughters were young and beautiful. Waldemar thought of their shepherd, who might choose his lamb from among the maidens. He remained silent and thoughtful for a time. Then he wrote: ""The high-born lady lay down to rise again no more"" He wrote: 'That thing came to her which comes to us all, in which there is nothing new' He died the next day. He is buried in the village of Daa in the Duchy of Lorraine, near the border with France, in a field of white flowers. He was buried with his wife and their three daughters, who are still alive. He wrote that he was glad to have seen them, and that he would never forget them.. The Wind said: ""The trees of the forest were doomed. Waldemar Daa wanted to build a noble ship, a man-of-war, a three-decker, which the king would be sure to buy"" The Wind said that Lady Daa had driven away, and I drove away too, said the Wind. Whir-r-r, whir- r-r! The Wind added: ""I often returned and passed over the island of Funen and the shores of the Belt"" The wind said: 'The loftiest tree may be bowed without being broken, said a voice within him. His daughters wept; all the people in the mansion wiped their eyes'. The hawk started up and flew away, for its nest was destroyed. The heron and all the birds of the forest became homeless, and flew about in fear and anger. Crows and ravens croaked, as if in scorn, while the trees were cracking and falling around them. Waldemar Daa and his three daughters were laughing at the wild cries of the birds, excepting one, the youngest, Anna Dorothea, who felt grieved to the heart. When they made preparations to fell a tree that was almost dead, and on whose naked branches the black stork had built her nest, she saw the poor little things stretching out their necks, and she begged for mercy for them, with the tears in her eyes. So the tree with the black Storks nest was. Waldemar Daa was fond of listening to his daughter Ida, and so was Waldemars daughter. While he was building the ship for the father, he was also building for himself a castle in the air. This might have happened, indeed, if there had been a real castle, with stone walls, ramparts, and a moat. But in spite of his clever head, the builder was still but a poor, inferior bird; and how can a sparrow expect to be admitted into the society of peacocks? He was not allowed to remain, and little Ida got over it, because she was obliged to do so. He passed on in my course, said the Wind, and he passed away also. He was a man of low origin, but possessing great pride; his eyes and forehead spoke of large intellect.. Waldemar Daa wanted gold, and the admiral wished for the proud black horses; therefore he praised them so much. But the hint was not taken, and consequently the ship was not bought. It remained on the shore covered with boards,a Noahs ark that never got to the water. Whir-r- r-rand that was a pity. I heard it all, said the Wind, for I accompanied the gentlemen through the open door of the stable, and strewed stalks of straw, like bars of gold, at their feet. I made the snowflakes whirl till the snow lay like a great lake round the ship, and drifted over it. Then they croaked in harsh accents of the forest that now existed no more, of the many pretty birds nests destroyed.. I let it hear my voice, that it might know what the storm has to say. Certainly I did my part towards teaching it seamanship. I often tumbled her long, brown hair, while she stood in the garden by the apple-tree, musing, and not heeding how I strewed the blossoms on her hair, and dishevelled it. Her sister Joanna was bright and slender as a lily; she had a tall and lofty carriage and figure, though, like her mother, rather stiff in back. She was very fond of walking through the great hall, where hung the portraits of her ancestors, and of walking with her mother through the garden. The snow drifts onwards. The apple-blossoms are scattered, the leaves fall,everything passes away, and men are passing away. Anna Dorothea, the pale hyacinth, a child of fourteen, was quiet and thoughtful. Her large, deep, blue eyes had a dreamy look, but a childlike smile still played round her mouth. Waldemar Daa was arrogant and proud, but he was also a learned man, and knew a great deal. Where would Joannas place be on that wall some day? and how would he look,her noble lord and husband? This is what she thought of, and often spoke of in a low voice to herself. I heard it as I swept into the long hall, and turned round to come out again. I was not able to blow it away, neither did I wish to do so. We have met in the garden, in the hollow lane, in a field and meadow, where she gathered herbs and flowers which she knew would. Waldemar Daa kept a fire in his fireplace, even in summer time. He would lock himself in his room, and for days the fire would be kept burning. He did not talk much of what he was doing. The secret powers of nature are generally discovered in solitude. So he fondly hoped; therefore the chimney smoked and the fire crackled so constantly. Yes, I was there too, said the Wind. Leave it alone, I sang down the Chimney. But Waldemar did not leave it alone. All he possessed vanished like smoke blown by me. The splendid black horses, where are they? What became of the cows in the field, the old gold and silver vessels in cupboards and chests, and even the house and home itself? It was easy to melt all these away in the gold-making crucible, and yet obtain. The Wind blew round the courtyard, said the Wind, like a watchman blowing his home, but no watchman was there. Poverty laid the table-cloth; poverty sat in the wardrobe and in the larder. The door fell off its hinges, cracks and fissures made their appearance everywhere; so that I could go in and out at pleasure, and that is how I know all about it. Where the chimney smokes, the meal is being cooked, says the proverb; but here a chimney smoked that devoured all the meals for the sake of gold. The Wind said: ""I blew around the courtyard like a Watchman, but there was no watch. The Wind blew the smoke and ashes into his face and beard. I moaned through the broken window-panes, and the yawning clefts in the walls. I blew into the chests and drawers belonging to his daughters. The lordly life had changed to a life of penury. I was the only one who rejoiced aloud in that castle. At last I snowed them up, and they say snow keeps people warm. It was good for them, for they had no wood. The forest, from which they might have obtained it, had been cut down. The frost was very bitter, and I rushed through loop-holes and passages, over gables and roofs with keen and cutting swiftness. The Wind said the castle was a castle, and it was a house, and a house.. The story of the life of a high-born man is told by the daughter of a man who lost his lands and horses. He tells how his daughter's father told her to give up and wait for spring to come. He said: ""After winter, spring will come, after want, good times. We must not lose patience, we must learn to wait"" The story is told in the book, which was published in 18th century England. The author, who is now in his seventies, says the story was inspired by the experience of his own family. The story was written by a man named John of Daa, who was a friend of the family. It is said that the story is based on a true story, and that Daa's. The master of the castle had watched through the night, in feverish excitement, and had been melting and cooling, distilling and mixing. I blew up the fire in the coals on the hearth, and it threw a red glow on his ghastly white face, lighting it up with a glare. Look at the alchymic glass, he cried; something glows in the crucible, pure and heavy. He lifted it with a trembling hand, and exclaimed in a voice of agitation, Gold! gold! He was quite giddy, I could have blown him down, said the Wind. But I only fanned the glowing coals, and accompanied him through the door to the room where his daughter sat shivering. His coat was powdered with ashes, and there were ashes in his beard and in his tangled hair.. The author was in the middle of a sweeping job when he met a gold-makers house. The glass he was holding in his hand fell from it, clattering to the ground, and brake in a thousand pieces. The last bubble of his happiness had burst, with a whiz and a whir, and I rushed away from the gold-maker house. He then swept the sky clear, and snapped off the dry twigs, which is certainly no great labor to do, yet it must be done. He rattled the broken windows, beat against the old rotten doors, and whistled through cracks and crevices, so that Mr. Owe Ramel did not much like to remain there.. Owe Ramel offered Waldemar Daa permission to remain in the house till the end of his life. No one thanked him for the offer, and I saw the ruined old gentleman lift his head, and throw it back more proudly than ever. Then I rushed against the house and the old lime-trees with such force, that one of the thickest branches, a decayed one, was broken off, and the branch fell at the entrance, and remained there. It might have been used as a broom, if any one had wanted to sweep the place out, and a grand sweeping-out there really was; I thought it would be so. There was nothing they could call their own, excepting the clothes they wore. Yes, there was one thing more, an alchymists glass, a new one, which had been lately bought, and filled with what could be. Waldemar Daa hid the glass in his bosom, and, taking his stick in his hand, the once rich gentleman passed with his daughters out of the house of Borreby. Ida walked on one side of the old man, and Anna Dorothea on the other. Joanna turned round, as they left the entrance, and perhaps she thought of his daughters and of the new song. The eldest and youngest, hand-in-hand, Went forth alone to a distant land. They walked along the high-road, where once they had driven in their splendid carriage. They went forth with their father as beggars.. Waldemar Daa and his daughters could not help hearing it, so I blew about their ears to drown the noise. They wandered across an open field to a mud hut, which they rented for a dollar and a half a year, a new home, with bare walls and empty cupboards. Crows and magpies fluttered about them, and cried, as if in contempt, Caw, caw, turned out of our nest. The last I saw of them was the pale hyacinth, Anna Dorothea. She was old and bent then; for fifty years had passed and she had outlived them all. Whir-r-r, whir- r-r! Away, away! year after year.. The Wind said that the house was to be looked at, and not to be touched. For the sake of the storks nest it had been allowed to remain. They did not like to drive the stork away; therefore the old shed was left standing, and the poor woman who dwelt in it allowed to stay. She could relate the history. The Wind said the house is a blot on the landscape, but it is not a bad blot. The wind said that it was a house to be seen, and to be admired, and was not abad blot. It was a good house, and a good place to live, the Wind said. The House of the Canons was built of red brick, with projecting gables. The smoke curled up thickly from the chimneys. The canons gentle lady and her beautiful daughters. The Egyptian bird had once interceded for the preservation of the nest of its black brother in the forest of Borreby. At that time she, the poor woman, was a young child, a white hyacinth in a rich garden. The poor school-boys did not even sing a psalm when the former lord of Bor reby was laid in the earth to rest. Sister Ida became the wife of a peasant; that was the hardest trial which befell our father, that the husband of his own daughter should be a miserable serf, whom his owner could place for punishment on the wooden horse.. The Wind blew Anna Dorotheas overboard before any one found out that she was a woman. I suppose he is under the ground now; and Idaalas! alas! it is not ended yet; miserable that I am! Kind Heaven, grant me that I may die. There was no window in the hut, only a hole in the wall; and the sun rose like a globe of burnished gold, and looked through the hole. On such another Easter morning as that on which Waldemar Daa imagined he had discovered the art of making gold, I heard the tones of a psalm under the storks nest, and within the crumbling walls. It was Anna Dorohas last song. I took pity on the proudest of the sisters, said the Wind.. The Wind told the story of Waldemar Daa and his daughters. The storks nest had secured her a home till her death. I sung over her grave; I sung at her fathers grave. I know where it lies, and where her grave is too, but nobody else knows it. All passed away, passed away! The Wind said. Tell it better, any of you, if you know how, said the Wind; and he rushed away, and was gone. The wind said, 'Tell it better. If you can, tell it better.' The wind told the tale. The Wind told it."
0.89,0.99,68.71966019417476,"Snow fell in masses from the roofs. Coaches and horses looked as if they had been frosted with sugar. The foot passengers kept within the shelter of the carriages. Towards evening, the weather became calm. The sky, cleared from the snow, looked more lofty and transparent. The stars shone with new brightness and purity. The snow fell from the roof of a house. The windows were plastered with snow on the outside. The roof of the house was covered with snow. The window was plastered. with. snow. It was near the end of January, and a terrible fall of snow was pelting down, and whirling through the streets and. lanes. Every one seemed in a great hurry; they ran, they flew, fell into each other’s arms, holding fast for a moment as long as they could stand safely. When two persons met in this path they stood still, for neither liked to take the first step on one side into the deep snow to let the other pass him. There they stood silent and motion. The frozen snow crackled under foot, and was quite firm enough to bear the sparrows, who hopped upon it in the morning dawn. They searched for food in the path which had been swept, but there was very little for them, and they were terribly cold. “Tweet, tweet,” said one to another; “they call this a new year, but I think it is worse than the last. We might just as well have kept the old year; I’m quite unhappy, and I have a right to be so.” “I was glad too, for I expected we should have some warm days, but my hopes have come to nothing,’ said a. ""I think mankind have made a mistake in reckoning time,"" said one sparrow. ""When spring comes, then the year begins,"" said another. ""It will come when the stork returns, but he is very uncertain,"" said a third. ""I have found a few comforts here in town which, I'm afraid, I should miss out in the country,"" said an old sparrow with a white poll. ""We shall be nearer to spring then, certainly, certainly,"" said the other sparrow who had been hopping about for a long time, chirping, but not saying anything of consequence. ""In the country they have more knowledge; shall we fly away there and wait?"" said another sparrow, ""and we shall be closer to spring"". “I and my husband have built a nest in one of these pots, and all our young ones, who have now flown away, were brought up there. The people who live there of course made the whole arrangement that they might have the pleasure of seeing us, or they would not have done it. It pleased them also to strew bread-crumbs for us, and so we have food, and may consider ourselves provided for. So I think my husband and I will stay where we are; although we are not very happy, but we shall stay.”“And we will fly into the country,” said the others, “to see if spring is coming.’ And away they flew. “In the country it was really winter, a few degrees colder than in the town. The sharp winds blew over the snow-covered fields. The cold wind blew. over theSnow-covered Fields.. The farmer, wrapped in warm clothing, sat in his sleigh, and beat his arms across his chest to keep off the cold. The horses ran till they smoked. The snow crackled, the sparrows hopped about in the wheel-ruts, and shivered, crying, “Tweet, tweet; when will spring come? It is very long in coming.” “Very long indeed,” sounded over the field, from the nearest snow-covered hill. It might have been the echo which people heard, or perhaps the words of that wonderful old man, who sat high on a. The sparrows asked, “Who is that old man?” “I know who he is,” said an old raven, who sat on the fence. “It is Winter, the old man of last year; he is not dead yet, as the calendar says, but acts as guardian to little Prince Spring who is coming. Ugh! the cold makes you shiver, little ones, does it not?’ “The calendar is only an invention of man, and is not arranged according to nature.”“There! Did I not tell you so?“ said the smallest of the sp Sparrows. � “We are created so much more clever than they are.’. Winter's Winter sat there still, with his un-wandering gaze fixed on the south. The mountains had disappeared, for over the land hung damp, icy mists. Large black crows flew about in silence; it was as if nature slept.“Tee-wit, tee-wit; is spring coming at last?” said the little girl. “Spring! How the cry resounded over field and meadow, and through the dark-brown woods, where the fresh green moss still gleamed on the trunks of the trees.” “The snow on the fields and the hills did not glitter as before. The white form of Winter sat still. He did not perceive that the snowy carpet seemed to sink as it were into the earth’s earth.’. The little maiden strewed flowers in her path. She held her apron before her: it was full of flowers. The more she scattered around her, the more flowers she contained. The little maiden held the hand of the old ice-man, Winter, and embraced him. All three were enveloped in a thick, damp mist, dark and heavy, that closed over them like a veil. The wind arose with mighty rustling tone, and cleared away the mist. Then the sun shone out warmly. Winter had vanished away, and the beautiful children of Spring sat on the throne of the year.“This is really a new year,” cried all the sparrows, “now we shall get our rights, and have some return for what we suffered in winter.”. Spring has come, says the poet. The forest already wore its dress of dark-green buds. The thyme blossomed in fresh fragrance. Primroses and anemones sprung forth, and violets bloomed in the shade. The world grew young again to her, as she said, “It is a blessed time out here to-day.” The young children of Spring seated themselves, holding each other’s hands, and sang, and laughed, and grew. Who could resist sitting down on such a beautiful carpet? and then the young children sat down. and sang. and laughed. and grew, and sat down on the carpet. and sat. and held each other's hands, holding. each others’. hands. The children sat and sat, and held hands. And the children sat.. The two lovers kissed, and were betrothed, and in the same moment the buds of the trees unfolded, and when the sun rose, the forest was green. A gentle rain fell upon them from the sky, but they did not notice it, for the rain-drops were their own tears of joy. Days and weeks went by, and the heat increased. Warm air waved the corn as it grew golden in the sun. The white northern lily spread its large green leaves over the glossy mirror of the woodland lake. The cuckoo sang and the lark carolled, for it was now beautiful spring. The careful willows had, however, covered their blossoms with woolly gloves; and this carefulness is rather tedious. The sun’s rays gleamed through the opening of the shade, in changing and varied colors.. The wife of Summer sat in a sheltered part of the wood, looking out at the gathering clouds. The clouds were piling themselves up like mountains, higher and higher. Then came a flash of light, as if the sun had rushed forth from the sky, flaming, burning, all-devouring. The rain poured down in streams, then there was darkness, then blinding light, then thrilling silence, then deafening din. It was as if a rolling crash of thunder had returned amid a rolling boom of thunder, and the rain had fallen in streams. The storm had come from every side, always increasing like a rising, rolling sea, and swooped towards the forest. All nature stood still in grave suspense. But in the lanes and the highways, passengers on foot or in carriages were hurrying to find a place of shelter.. Summer sits on a rock by the heaving salt sea and sits in the warm sunshine. The birds sang, the fishes leaped up to the surface of the water, the gnats danced in the sunshine. Strengthened by the cool bath, he sat in thewarm sunshine, while all around him renewed nature bloomed strong, luxuriant, and beautiful. It was summer, warm, lovely summer. The sun’s rays pierced the clouds, and the water-drops glittered like pearls on leaf and stem. The corn and the blades of grass lay beaten down and swamped, so that it seemed impossible they could ever raise themselves again. But after a while the rain began to fall gently, the sun's rays pierced. Summer and his bosom-wife saw it with different eyes, to them the altar-table was covered with the offerings of nature. The evening sky shone like gold, no church dome could ever gleam so brightly, and between the golden evening and the blushing morning there was moonlight. The hop, hanging in clusters, filled the air with sweet fragrance, and beneath the hazel-bushes, where the nuts hung in great bunches, rested a man and his grave consort.“See,” she exclaimed, “what wealth, what blessings surround us.” “What wealth,what blessings surround me,’ she exclaimed. “See what wealth,What blessings surround. us. It was indeed summer.. “Do you wish to see golden fruit?” said the man, “then rejoice,” and he lifted his arm. “The leaves of the forest put on colors of red and gold, and bright tints covered the woodlands. The rose-bushes gleamed with scarlet hips, and the branches of the elder-trees hung down with the weight of the full, dark berries.” “Everything is home-like and good, and yet, I know not why, I long for rest and peace; I can scarcely express what I feel,’ he said. ‘I can scarcely describe what I am feeling.’ “I can hardly express whatI am feeling,“ he said, ‘because I am in a dream, and I can’t explain it.�. The forest leaves became more and more yellow, leaf after leaf fell, and the stormy winds of Autumn howled. The wild chestnuts fell ripe from their dark, green shells, and in the forests the violets bloomed for the second time. But the queen of the year became more  silent and pale. She said, “It blows cold, and night brings the damp mist; I long for the land of my childhood.” Then she saw the storks fly away every one, and she stretched out her hands towards them. She looked at the empty nests; in one of them grew a long-stalked corn flower, in another the yellow mustard seed. “I suppose he could not bear it when the wind blew, and therefore he has left. The year was now far advanced, and upon the fallen, yellow leaves, lay the queen of the year, looking up with mild eyes at a gleaming star. A gust of wind swept through the foliage, and the leaves fell in a shower. The summer queen was gone, but a butterfly, the last of theyear, flew through the cold air. Damp fogs came, icy winds blew, and  the long, dark nights of winter approached. The ruler of the Year appeared with hair white as snow, but he knew it not.. The angel of Christmas consecrated the young trees that were to adorn his feast. The church bells rang out for Christmas time. And then the church bells ringing out forChristmas time. The angel ofChristmas said: “Let the snow lie warmly upon the tender seed”. Learn to endure the thought that another is worshipped whilst thou art still lord. Learn. to endure being forgotten while yet thou livest. The angels of Christmas said: “For power, but not for rest.’” “My resting-time draws near; the young pair of the year will soon claim my crown and sceptre”“But the night is still thine,” said the angel of. Christmas, “for power,but not for Rest.”. “The hour of thy freedom will come when Spring appears.” “And when will Spring come?” asked Winter. “It will come When the stork returns.’ ““And with white locks and snowy beard, cold, bent, and hoary, but strong as the wintry storm, and firm as the ice, old Winter sat on the snowdrift-covered hill, looking towards the south, where Winter had sat before, and gazed.“. ""Winter"" is the old man of the former year. He is not dead, as the calendar says, but he is guardian to the spring, which is coming. ""When will Spring come?"" asked the sparrows. ""For we shall have better times then, and a better rule,"" said Winter. ""The old times are worth nothing,"" said the ruler of the year. ""Winter"" was the summer dream of Winter. He was the ruler. of his youthful days and of his manhood, and in the morning dawn the whole forest glittered with hoar frost, which the sun shook from the branches. The ruler dreamt of his. youthful days, and the ruler dreamd of his boyhood.. ""Spring is coming,"" the birds said, ""and the sunshine became warmer, the snow melted, and the birds twittered, “Spring isComing!” And high in the air flew the first stork, and a lovely child sat on the back of each, and they sank down on the open field, kissed the earth, and kissed the quiet old man. And, as the mist from the mountain top, he vanished away and disappeared. And the story of the year was finished.”"

He had a nightingale and a rose tree. The nightingales sang sweet melodies in his throat. The Prince said, 'Listen! I will see what this princess says' The Prince married the princess. The Princess said: 'I will tell you what I say' The prince said: ""I will hear what you say."" The Princess replied: 'Yes!' The Prince then said: ""I will say what I mean."" The Prince was married. The princess said:  ""Yes!"" and ""Thank you kindly"". The Emperor had them brought into a large hall, where the Princess was playing at ""Visiting,"" with the ladies of the court. When she saw the caskets with the presents, she clapped her hands for joy. But the Princess touched it, and was almost ready to cry. ""It is not made at all, it is natural!"" she said to the Emperor. ""Let us see what is in the other casket, before we get into a bad humor,"" said the Emperor, ""it is charming!"" The Emperor then gave the Princess the rose and the nightingale.. The Prince knocked on the door of the palace of the Emperor of France. The Princess refused to see him, but the Prince was not to be discouraged. The Prince asked if he could have employment at the palace. The Emperor said yes, and the Prince went to see the bird. The bird sang so delightfully that at first no one could say anything ill-humored of her. The Empress was delighted with the bird's singing. The prince was delighted, too, and wept like a child at the remembrance of the song. He asked the Emperor to let the bird fly, and it flew away. The Queen was delighted. The King was delighted and said he would let it fly, too.. ""I want some one to take care of the pigs, for we have a great many of them,"" said the Prince. The Prince made a pretty little kitchen-pot. Little bells were hung all round it; and when the pot was boiling, these bells tinkled in the most charming manner, and played the old melody. The Princess happened to walk that way, and when she heard the tune, she stood quite still, and seemed pleased. It was the only piece she knew; and she played it with one finger. ""Why there is my piece,"" she said, ""and I will play it for you."" The Prince replied, ""Yes, of course,"" and she sang it.. ""I cannot sell it for less,"" rejoined the swineherd. ""Ten kisses from the Princess, or I keep the kitchen-pot myself,"" he said. ""That must not be, either!"" said the Princess. ""He is an impudent fellow!"" she walked on; but when she had gone a little way, the bells tinkled so prettily that the bells rang out again. ""Go in and ask him the price of the instrument,"" said the lady.. The Princess asked the court-ladies to stand before her in a corner. She then gave the swineherd and the kitchen-pot a kiss. The court-lads danced and clapped their hands. They knew perfectly well what was cooking at every fire throughout the city, from the chamberlain's to the cobbler's. The pot was boiling the whole evening, and the whole of the following day.. The Prince, for no one knew that he was other than an ill-favored swineherd, let not a day pass without working at something. He at last constructed a rattle, which, when it was swung round, played all the waltzes and jig tunes, which have ever been heard since the creation of the world. ""Ah, that is superbe!"" said the Princess when she passed by. ""I have never heard prettier compositions! Go in and ask him the price of the instrument; but mind, he shall have no more kisses!"" ""One must encourage art,"" said she, ""I am the Emperor's daughter."". ""Oh--but we should not like that at all!"" said they. ""If I can kiss him, surely you can. Remember that you owe everything to me."" So the ladies were obliged to go to him again. ""A hundred kisses from the Princess,"" said he, ""or else let everyone keep his own!"" ""Stand round!"" said she; and all the ladies stood round her whilst the kissing was going on. ""What can be the reason for such a crowd close by the pigsty?"" said the Emperor, who happened just then to step out on the balcony; he rubbed. The Emperor went down to the court to see what was going on. He boxed the Princess's ears with his slipper as the swineherd was taking the eighty-sixth kiss. The Princess now stood and wept, the swinherd scolded, and the rain poured down. The Emperor was very angry, and he ordered the Princess and swine her out of the city. The swinehired was taken to a farm and killed. The princess was taken away in a carriage and died in a field. The Prince was taken home in a car and died of thirst.. The swineherd went behind a tree, washed the black and brown color from his face, threw off his dirty clothes, and stepped forth in his princely robes. He looked so noble that the Princess could not help bowing before him. ""If I had but married the handsome young Prince! Ah! how unfortunate I am!"" he said. ""Thou could'st not prize the rose and the nightingale, but thou wast ready to kiss the swine herd for the sake of a trumpery plaything. Thou art"

The soldier agreed to try it out, and climbed the tree to the top. He was able to climb the tree and reach the top of the tree. He then returned home with a large knapsack and a sword.. The story is said to have been told by a soldier who was trapped in a tree by a woman. The woman told him to get money from a chest in the ground. She then gave him a rope to tie around his body, so that he could be pulled up when he called out to her. The soldier followed her instructions, and the story was told to him by the woman in the tree. The story is believed to have taken place in the year of 16th century.. The soldier asked the witch for money. She said she would rather give him an old tinder-box. The soldier took the box and went down to the bottom of the pit. There he found another dog, with eyes as big as mill-wheels. He placed the dog on his apron, and the other dog sat on a chest full of gold. He then took the gold from the chest and returned to the soldier.. The story of the witch and the dog is told by the author in his play, The Magician's Dog. The soldier climbs up a tree, and lets himself down through a hollow to the ground beneath. He finds a large hall, in which many hundred lamps are all burning, and a dog with eyes as large as teacups staring at him. He places the dog on the witch's apron, and opens the chest, and sits him on the apron.. The soldier opened the chest and saw a quantity of gold money. But when he saw the silver money, he quickly threw away all the coppers he had taken. He filled his pockets and his knapsack with nothing but silver. The dog was really hideous; his eyes were, truly, as big as towers, and they turned round and round in his head like wheels.. The soldier threw away all the silver money he had taken, and filled his pockets and his knapsack with gold instead. He replaced the dog on the chest, closed the door, and called up through the tree,. The story is based on a battle between a soldier and a witch. The soldier demanded that the witch give him the tinderbox. He then cut off the witch's head and put it in his pocket. She refused to tell him what he was going to do with it. He tied up all his money in her apron and slung it on his back like a bundle.. The story of a young soldier and his love for a beautiful girl. The girl is not to be seen by anyone but the soldier. The story ends with the soldier's love for the princess. The princess is now married to another man. The tale is told in a book called 'The Story of a Soldier and His Love for a Princess' The book is published by Simon & Schuster, and is available in English and French. The book's cover is a picture of the princess, and the story is told from her point of view.. A man was rich, had fine clothes, and many friends, who all declared he was a fine fellow and a real gentleman. But his money would not last forever, and as he spent and gave away a great deal daily, and received none, he found himself at last with only two shillings left. So he was obliged to leave his elegant rooms, and live in a little garret under the roof, where he had to. A soldier found a piece of candle stuck in a tinder-box in a tree. The dog with eyes as big as teacups came to him and said, What orders, master? The soldier said, well this is a pleasant tinderbox, if it brings me all I wish for. He struck the flint once, the dog who sat on the chest of copper money made his appearance. If he struck the steel once, he saw the dog with the eyes of a tower. If twice, the dogs came from. The soldier had now plenty of money; he returned to his elegant rooms, and reappeared in his fine clothes, so that his friends knew him again directly, and made as much of him as before. After a while he began to think it was very strange that no one could get a look at the princess. Every one says she is very beautiful, thought he to himself; but what is the use of that if she is to be shut up in a copper castle surrounded by so many towers. Can I by any means get to see her.. The princess had a dream of a dog and a soldier. The dog ran off with the princess. The soldier sent for the dog again in the night to fetch her. But the old lady put on water boots, and ran after him. She found that he carried the princess into a large house. She thought it would help her to remember the place if she made a large cross on the door with a piece of chalk. Then she went home to bed, and the dog presently returned with the Princess.. The king and queen accompanied the lady and all the officers of the household, to see where the princess had been. When they came to the first door with a cross on it, the queen pointed to a second door also. The queen was a very clever woman; she could do a great deal more than merely ride in a carriage. She took her large gold scissors, cut a piece of silk into squares, and made a neat little bag.. The dog carried the princess on his back, and ran with her to the soldier. The soldier loved her very much, and wished that he had been a prince. The dog did not observe how the flour ran out of the bag all the way from the castle wall to the soldiers house, and even up to the window, where he had climbed with the princess. In the morning the king and queen found out where their daughter had been, and the soldier was taken up and put in prison. He could see through the iron grating of the little window how the people were hastening out to see him hanged; he heard the drums beating, and.

0.38,0.48,36.314847942754916,"John wept bitterly. He had no one in the wide world now; neither father, mother, brother, nor sister. But at last his eyes closed, and he fell asleep with his head resting against the hard bedpost. Then he dreamed a strange dream; he thought he saw the sun shining upon him, and his father was alive and well. A beautiful girl, with a golden crown on her head, gave him her hand.. The son walked behind the coffin which contained his father, whom he so dearly loved. He heard the earth fall on the coffin-lid, and watched it till only a corner remained in sight. The sun shone brightly down on the green trees, as if it would say, You must not be so sorrowful, John. Do you see the beautiful blue sky above you? Your father is up there, and he prays to the loving. John saw the birds fly away, and longed to fly with them. But first he cut out a large wooden cross, to place on his fathers grave. When he brought it there in the evening, he found the grave decked out with gravel and flowers. John saw them fly away out of the green trees into the wide world, and he longing to fly.. John was born into poverty, and his father had taken him to church every Sunday to hear the psalms. He left his father's grave to try his fortune in the world, and set out on his own. He met a stranger who had known his father, and who had loved him very much. John decided to become a ringer, and went to work for him.. John, the little ringer, left his home and went on a journey. He did not even know the names of the places he passed through, and could scarcely understand the language of the people he met. The first night he slept on a haystack, out in the fields, for there was no other bed.. John slept safely in his bed, and awoke to the sound of birds singing. The moon hung high up in the blue ceiling, and he had no fear of its setting fire to his curtains. He heard Gods word, joined in singing the psalms, and listened to the preacher. It seemed to him just as if he were in his own church.. John, who was not there to weed and attend to his fathers grave, set to work. He pulled up the high grass, raised the wooden crosses which had fallen down, and replaced the wreaths which had been blown away from their places by the wind. He thought, Perhaps some one is doing the same for my fathers grave as I am not there. He then went to a little lonely church which stood on a hill, and sat down in a. Two wicked men were going to throw a dead man outside the church door. The man's body was to be buried in the church, but the men were not going to leave it. The dead man's son, John, asked them to leave him to rest in peace.. John offered to pay the debtors if they would leave the dead man in peace. The men took the money, laughed at him for his good nature, and went their way. John then laid the dead body back in the coffin, folded the hands, and took leave of it. All around him he could see the prettiest little elves dancing in the moonlight. They were not disturbed by his appearance, for they knew he was good and harmless among men.. Some of them were not taller than the breadth of a finger, and they wore golden combs in their long, yellow hair. They were rocking themselves two together on the large dew-drops with which the leaves and the high grass were sprinkled. Then they sang songs, and John remembered that he had learnt those pretty songs when he was a little boy.. A young boy was travelling through a wood when he met a stranger. The stranger told him that he was going into the wide world with him. The boy and the stranger became friends, and soon travelled the world together. The pair were eating breakfast when an old woman came towards them. She was very old and almost bent double, but they were both very happy.. The old woman was carrying a bundle of firewood in her apron when she fell and broke her leg. The stranger offered to give her three fern stems in exchange for her leg, but she refused. He said he had a salve that would quickly make her leg well and strong again, so that she would be able to walk home herself.. The story of a pair of travellers who set out on a journey to the top of a mountain. They had to travel a whole day before they reached the summit. The pair had to pass through black forests and piles of rock as large as a town. They also had to go through thick, heavy clouds to get to the summit of the mountain.. The journey had been so fatiguing that John and his fellow-traveller stopped to rest at a roadside inn. In the large public room of the inn a great many persons were assembled to see a comedy performed by dolls. Right in front, in the very best place, sat a stout butcher, with a great bull-dog by his side who seemed very much inclined to bite.. The play was a very pleasant play, not at all mournful; but just as the queen stood up and walked across the stage, the great bull-dog, who should have been held back by his master, made a spring forward, and caught the queen in the teeth by the slender wrist. The poor man, who was exhibiting the dolls, was much annoyed, and quite sad about his queen; she was the prettiest doll he had, and the. The queen threw herself on her knees, took off her beautiful crown, and, holding it in her hand, cried, Take this from me, but do rub my husband and his courtiers. The poor man who owned the theatre could scarcely refrain from weeping; he was so sorry that he could not help them. The queen's wish was granted, and the dolls were able to dance of themselves.. The fellow-traveller promised to rub the ointment on four or five of his dolls. He did not require anything in return, excepting the sword which the showman wore by his side. As soon as he received the sword he anointed six of the dolls with the Ointment. The dolls were able immediately to dance so gracefully that all the living girls in the room could not help joining in the dance.. John saw more of the beautiful world than he had ever known before. They could see for miles round, far away to places they had never visited. The sun shone brightly in the blue firmament above, and through the clear mountain air came the sound of the huntsmans horn. The soft, sweet notes brought tears into his eyes, and he could not help exclaiming, How good and loving God is to give us all. So he cut off the wings of the dead swan with one blow, and carried them away with him. You see now that a sword will be very useful, he said. He then continued his journey over the mountains for many miles, till they at length reached a large city, containing hundreds of towers. In the midst of the city stood a splendid marble palace, roofed with pure red gold, in which dwelt the king.. The princess asked her lovers to guess three things. If he could not guess them, he was hanged or had his head cut off. Each prince who tried to guess them had been hanged or beheaded. The old king became so distressed that he and his soldiers knelt and prayed that the princess might become good. But she continued as wicked as ever. The women who drank brandy would color it quite black before they drank it, to show how they mourned.. The princess was so beautiful that everybody forgot her wickedness, and shouted Hurrah! Twelve lovely maidens in white silk dresses, holding golden tulips in their hands, rode by her side on coal-black horses. The princess herself had a snow-white steed, decked with diamonds and rubies. Her dress was of cloth of gold, and the whip she held in her hand. The story of a young man who fell in love with a woman who was a witch. He was told by his fellow-travellers that she was a wicked witch who ordered people to be hanged or beheaded. He decided to visit her and asked permission to go and ask her for her hand. She was so lovely that he could not help loving her.. The old king was so overcome with emotion that he had to wipe his eyes with his dressing gown. He was led out into the princess's pleasure gardens, and there he saw a frightful sight. On every tree hung three or four kings sons who had wooed the princess, but had not been able to guess the riddles she gave them. All the flowers were supported by human bones instead of sticks, and human skulls in the flower-pots grinned. John kissed the good old kings hand, and said he was sure it would be all right, for he was quite enchanted with the beautiful princess. It was decided that John should come to the palace the next day, when the judges and the whole of the counsellors would be present, to try if he could guess the first riddle. If he succeeded, he would have to come a second time; but if not, he'd lose his life.. The story of the princess and the riddle is told in the book of the same name. The story was written by the author of the book, who was a friend of the girl's family. The book was published in 18th-century England, and is now known as the story of The Princess and the Riddle of the Riddles. The author, who wrote the story, is now in his seventies, and has written. John's comrade prepared a large bowl of punch, and said, Now let us be merry, and drink to the health of the princess. But after drinking two glasses, John became so sleepy, that he could not keep his eyes open, and fell fast asleep. Then his fellow-traveller lifted him gently out of his chair, and laid him on the bed. As soon as it was quite dark, he took the two large wings which he had cut from the dead swan. The princess flew away over the city towards a high mountain. The fellow-traveller made himself invisible, so that she could not possibly see him. He whipped the princess with his rod, and the blood came whenever he struck her. They went through a long, wide passage. A thousand gleaming spiders ran here and there on the walls, causing them to glitter as if they were illuminated with fire.. The princess was seated on a throne supported by four skeleton horses, whose harness had been made by fiery-red spiders. The throne itself was made of milk-white glass, and the cushions were little black mice, each biting the others tail. On the throne sat an old magician with a crown on his ugly head, and a sceptre in his hand. Great black grasshoppers played the mouth organ.. Little black goblins with false lights in their caps danced about the hall. No one could see the traveller, and he had placed himself just behind the throne. The courtiers who came in afterwards looked noble and grand. But any one with common sense could see what they really were, only broomsticks, with cabbages for heads.. The magician then opened the mountain and she flew home again, but the traveller followed and flogged her so much with the rod, that she sighed quite deeply about the heavy hail-storm. The traveller then returned to the inn where John still slept, took off his wings and laid down on the bed, for he was very tired. Early in the morning John awoke, and when his fellow-trave. John and the princess met in the town and walked to the palace. The old king stood near wiping his eyes with his white pocket-handkerchief. When the princess entered, she looked even more beautiful than she had appeared the day before. But when he uttered the single word shoe, she turned as pale as a ghost. All her wisdom could not help her, for he had guessed rightly.. John was able to guess correctly the second time, and it caused great rejoicing at the palace. His fellow-traveller was glad also, when he heard how successful John had been. But John folded his hands, and thanked God, who, he felt quite sure, would help him again. The princess this time was to think of a glove, and he told John as if he had again heard it in a dream. If he only guessed rightly the third time, he would. The story of John of Gormenghast is told in the book The Adventures of John the Great. The book is based on the life of the Welsh"

The other ducks liked much better to swim about in the river than to sit under a burdock leaf, to have a gossip with her. The spot was as wild as the centre of a thick wood. It was, indeed, delightful to walkabout in the country. The book is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99.. ""How large the world is,"" said the young ducks, when they found how much more room they now had than while they were inside the egg-shell. At length one shell cracked, and then another, and from each egg came a living creature that lifted its head and cried, ""Peep, peep."" ""Do you imagine this is the whole world?"" asked the mother. ""Wait till you have seen the garden,"" she said, ""it stretches far beyond that to the parson's field"". ""Let me see the egg that will not break,"" said the duck. ""I have no doubt it is a turkey's egg,"" she said. ""Please yourself,"" said she. ""A few days will be nothing,"" he replied. ""Take my advice, leave it where it is and teach the other children to swim"" The egg broke, and a young one crept forth crying, ""Peep, peep."" It was very large and ugly.. The mother duck took her young brood down to the water, and jumped in with a splash. ""Quack, quack,"" cried she, and one after another the little ducklings jumped in. The water closed over their heads, but they came up again in an instant, and swam about quite prettily with their legs paddling under them. The ugly duckling was also in the water swimming with them.. The story of a duck and her children is told by the author in a novel. The story is about a duck who takes her children to the farmyard to meet a family who are fighting for an eel's head. The cat takes the eel, and the duck takes the children with her. The duck takes them to a farmyards, and introduces them to grand society. The children are told to bow their heads prettily to the duck.. ""Let him alone,"" said the mother, ""he is not doing any harm"" ""Yes, but he is so big and ugly,"" said a spiteful duck, ""and therefore he must be turned out"" ""That is impossible, your grace,"" replied the mother. ""He has a very good disposition, and swims as well or even better than the others"". The duckling had remained too long in the egg, and therefore his figure is not properly formed. I think he will grow up pretty, and perhaps be smaller,"" said the old duck. ""Now make yourself at home, and if you can find an eel's head, you can bring it to me"". The duckling was driven about by every one. Even his brothers and sisters were unkind to him. The ducks pecked him, the chickens beat him, and the girl who fed the poultry kicked him with her feet. So at last he ran away, frightening the little birds in the hedge as he flew over the palings. ""They are afraid of me because I am ugly,"" he said. So he closed his eyes, and flew still farther, until he came out on a large moor.. The duckling had no thoughts of marriage; all he wanted was permission to lie among the rushes, and drink some of the water on the moor. Two wild geese, or rather goslings, for they had not been out of the egg long, and were very saucy. ""Listen, friend,"" said one of them to the duckling, ""you are so ugly, that we like you very well. Will you go with us, and become a bird of passage?"". ""Pop, pop,"" sounded in the air, and the two wild geese fell dead among the rushes. ""Pop, Pop,"" echoed far and wide in the distance, and whole flocks of wild Geese rose up. The sound continued from every direction, for the sportsmen surrounded the moor, and some were even seated on branches of trees. The blue smoke from the guns rose like clouds over the dark trees, and as it floated. ""Oh,"" sighed the duckling, ""how thankful I am for being so ugly; even a dog will not bite me."" And so he lay quite still, while the shot rattled through the rushes, and gun after gun was fired over him. It was late in the day before all became quiet, but even then the poor young thing did not dare to move. He waited quietly for several hours, and then, after looking carefully around him, hastened away from the moor.. A woman, a tom cat, and a hen lived in a cottage. The hen had very short legs, so she was called ""Chickie short legs"" She laid good eggs, and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child. In the morning, the strange visitor was discovered, and the tom cat began to purr. The old woman thought it must be a fat duck, that had strayed from home.. The duckling was allowed to remain on trial for three weeks, but there were no eggs. The duckling felt such a great longing for a swim on the water, that he could not help telling the hen. ""What an absurd idea,"" said the hen, ""You have nothing else to do, therefore you have foolish fancies."" The duck was then allowed to go back to his home. The story was told by the author, who later wrote a book on the same subject.. ""It is so delightful to swim about on the water,"" said the duckling, ""and so refreshing to feel it close over your head, while you dive down to the bottom"" ""Delightful, indeed!"" said the hen, ""why you must be crazy! Ask the cat, he is the cleverest animal I know, ask him how he would like to swim"" ""You don't understand me,"" saidthe duckling. ""Don't imagine such nonsense, child, and thank. The duckling left the cottage and soon found water on which it could swim and dive, but was avoided by all other animals, because of its ugly appearance. One evening, just as the sun set amid radiant clouds, there came a large flock of beautiful birds out of the bushes. The duckling had never seen any like them before. The hen said: ""I advise you, therefore, to lay eggs, and learn to purr as quickly as possible"". The ugly little duckling felt quite a strange sensation as he watched them. He whirled himself in the water like a wheel, stretched out his neck towards them, and uttered a cry so strange that it frightened himself. They were swans, and they curved their graceful necks, while their soft plumage shown with dazzling whiteness. They uttered a singular cry, as they spread their glorious wings and flew away from those cold regions to warmer countries across the sea. When at last they were out of his sight, he dived under the water, and rose again almost beside himself with excitement. The duckling had to paddle with his legs as well as he could, to keep the space from closing up. He became exhausted at last, and lay still and helpless, frozen fast in the ice. Early in the morning, a peasant, who was passing by, saw what had happened. He broke the ice in pieces with his wooden shoe, and carried the duckling home to his wife. The warmth revived the poor little creature; but when the children wanted to play with him, the duckle. The duckling was born in a moor, but managed to slip out through a door. He was in a large garden, before he well knew how it had happened. The apple-trees were in full blossom, and the fragrant elders bent their long green branches down to the stream. From a thicket close by came three beautiful white swans, rustling their feathers, and swimming over the smooth water.. The duckling remembered the lovely birds, and felt more strangely unhappy than ever. ""Kill me,"" said the poor bird; and he bent his head down to the surface of the water, and awaited death. But what did he see in the clear stream below? His own image; no longer a dark, gray bird, ugly and disagreeable to look at, but a graceful and beautiful swan. To be born in a duck's nest, in a. The new-comer felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble, because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him. He had been persecuted and despised for his ugliness, and now he heard them say he was the most beautiful of all the birds. He felt quite ashamed, and hid his head under his wing; for he did not know what to do, he was so happy.. The duck cried joyfully, from the depths of his heart, ""I never dreamed of such happiness as this, while I was an"

He devastated their countries with fire and sword, and his soldiers trod down the crops in the fields. The prince was of opinion that all this was right, and that it was only the natural course which things ought to take. He brought enormous wealth home from the conquered towns, and gradually accumulated in his residence riches which could nowhere be equalled. He was feared by all, and fortune favoured his deeds. He died in a rage, but his name was feared and his deeds were honoured by all. The story was told by the son of a man who had been killed by the prince, and was buried in the same place as his father. The tale was told in a book called The Story of the Wicked Prince, which was published in 17th century England.. He made war with all his neighbours, and defeated them. He erected magnificent palaces, churches, and halls, and all who saw these splendid buildings and great treasures exclaimed admiringly: “What a mighty prince!” But they did not know what endless misery he had brought upon other countries, nor did they hear the sighs and lamentations which rose up from the débris of the destroyed cities. The conquered kings were chained up with golden fetters to his chariot when he drove through the streets of his city. These kings had to kneel at his and his courtiers’ feet when they sat at table, and live on the mor. The Prince of Wales wanted to conquer God. He ordered a magnificent ship to be constructed, with which he could sail through the air. The ship was covered with thousands of eyes, but each eye was the barrel of a gun. The prince sat in the centre of the ship, and had only to touch a spring in order to make thousands of bullets fly out in all directions, while the guns were at once loaded again. Hundreds of eagles were attached to this ship. It rose with the swiftness of an arrow up towards the sun. It was of many colours, and of many colour, but like the tail of a peacock, it was covered in thousands of Eyes. The Prince of Greece wanted to have his own statue erected on the public places and fixed on the royal palaces. He even wished it to be placed. The earth was soon left far below, and looked, with its mountains and woods, like a cornfield where the plough had made furrows which separated green meadows. The wicked prince showered thousands of bullets upon him, but they rebounded from his shining wings and fell down like ordinary hailstones. The earth looked only like a map with indistinct lines upon it; and at last it entirely disappeared in. ""I will conquer God!"" said the prince. ""I have sworn it: my will must be done!"" He spent seven years in the construction of wonderful ships to sail through the air, and had darts cast from the hardest steel to break the walls of heaven with. ""The prince was lying half-dead in his ship, when it sank with a terrible shock into the branches of a large tree in the wood"" ""I am the king of the world,"" said the king, ""and I am the lord of all the world."" ""The king is the king"" said the queen. ""And the lord is the lord, and I am his queen."" ""I'm the King of the World,"" said a young prince, ""And I am not the lord,"" said another.. A prince was attacked by a swarm of gnats. He drew his sword and brandished it, but only touched the air. He ordered his servants to bring costly coverings and wrap him in them. But one single gnat had placed itself inside one of the coverings. It crept into the prince’s ear and stung him. The place burnt like fire, and the poison entered into his blood. Mad with pain, he tore off the covering and his clothes too. He danced about before the eyes of his ferocious soldiers, who now mocked at him, the mad prince, who wished to make war with God, and was overcome by a single little gnat. He was killed by the gnats, and his body was consumed by fire. He died in a fiery rage."
0.73,0.83,62.41819371727748,"A king had eleven sons, and one daughter, named Eliza. The eleven brothers were princes, and each went to school with a star on his breast, and a sword by his side. Their father, who was king of the country, married a very wicked queen, who did not love the poor children at all. They knew this from the very first day after the wedding. In the palace there were great festivities, and the children played at receiving company. But instead of having, as usual, all the cakes and apples that were left, she gave them some sand in a tea-cup, and told them to pretend it was cake. The children were indeed happy, but it was not to remain so.. ""Go out into the world and get your own living,"" said the queen. ""Fly like great birds, who have no voice"" They flew through the windows of the palace, over the park, to the forest beyond. They hovered over the roof, twisted their long necks and flapped their wings, but no one heard them or saw them. They flew till they came to a thick, dark wood, which stretched far away to the seashore. They then flew away, high up in the clouds, to a place far away from the palace. They were turned into eleven beautiful wild swans. The queen said she had made them ugly, but they were beautiful.. Eliza was a little girl, and her brothers gave her all the kisses they could give her. When she was 15 she returned home, and the queen became full of spite and hatred towards her. Willingly would she have turned her into a swan, like her brothers, but she did not dare to do so yet, because the king wished to see his daughter. The queen would have turned Eliza into a Swan, if she had been able to do it. But she could not do it, because she was too young. Eliza became a girl. She became a beautiful girl. The roses and the hymn-book told the real truth. The wind would flutter the leaves, and say to the book, ""Who can be more pious than you?"" and then the book would answer ""Eliza"". A witch kissed three toads and put them in the bath-room of a queen. She said to one, ""When Eliza comes to the bath, seat yourself upon her head, that she may become as stupid as you are"" Then she said to another, ""Place yourself on her forehead, that her father may not know her"" ""Rest on her heart,"" she whispered to the third, ""then she will have evil inclinations, and suffer in consequence"" So she put the toads into the clear water, and they turned green immediately. She next called Eliza, and helped her to undress and get into the bath. As Eliza dipped her head under the water, one of the toad sat on her hair, a second on her brow, and a third on her breast. But. When her father saw her, he was much shocked, and declared she was not his daughter. She was too good and too beautiful for him to recognize her. She then went away, and spent the whole day walking over the fields. She longed for her brothers, who had been driven out of the world. She could not find them, so she went back to her father. She said she would return when she had found them. She never did. She died in childbirth, and was buried in a grave. She had no more children. She left behind her husband and children, and her husband had no children. He died in a car accident.. She had been but a short time in the wood when night came on, and she quite lost the path. She laid herself down on the soft moss, offered up her evening prayer, and leaned her head against the stump of a tree. All nature was still, and the soft, mild air fanned her forehead. The light of hundreds of glow-worms shone amidst the grass and the moss, like green fire. If she touched a twig with her hand, ever so lightly, the brilliant insects fell down around her, like shooting-stars. All night long she dreamt of her brothers again, playing together.. Eliza awoke in a lake with golden sands. The sun was high in the heavens, but she could not see him. The birds sang, and the people came out of the book, and spoke to Eliza and her brothers. But, as the leaves turned over, they darted back again to their places, that all might be in order. The lake was so clear that, had not the wind rustled the branches of the trees and the bushes, so that they moved, they would have appeared as if painted in the depths of the lake. Every leaf was reflected in the water, whether it stood in the shade or the sunshine. The water was clear enough to make the lake look as if it were painted.. Eliza was so terrified at finding her face so brown and ugly that she wetted her hand and rubbed her eyes and forehead. After she had undressed, and dipped herself in the fresh water, a more beautiful king's daughter could not be found in the wide world. Then she wandered far into the forest, not knowing whither she went. It is God who makes the wild apples grow in the wood, to satisfy the hungry, and He now led her to one of these trees, which was so loaded with fruit, that the boughs bent beneath the weight. Here she held her noonday repast, placed props under theboughs, and then went into the gloomiest depths of the forest. It was so still that she could hear the sound of her own footsteps, as well as the rustling of every withered. The night was very dark. Not a bird was to be seen, not a sunbeam could penetrate through the large, dark boughs of the trees. Their lofty trunks stood so close together, that, when she looked before her, it seemed as if she were enclosed within trellis-work. Such solitude she had never known before. When she awoke in the morning, she knew not whether she had dreamt this, or if it had really been so. Then she continued her wandering; but she had not gone many steps forward when she met an old woman with berries in her basket.. Eliza asked her if she had not seen eleven princes riding through the forest. ""No,"" replied the old woman, ""but I saw yesterday eleven swans, with gold crowns on their heads, swimming on the river close by"" Then she led Eliza a little distance farther to a sloping bank, and at the foot of it wound a little river. The trees on its banks stretched their long leafy branches across the water towards each other. The countless pebbles on the sea-shore had been smoothed and rounded by the action of the water. Glass, iron, stones, everything that lay there mingled together, had taken its shape from the same power. And there, before the young maiden's eyes, lay the glorious ocean, but not a sail appeared on its surface.. The sea showed more changes in a few hours than the most varying lake could produce during a whole year. If a black heavy cloud arose, it was as if the sea said, ""I can look dark and angry too"" When the wind slept, and the clouds glowed with the red sunlight, then the sea looked like a rose leaf. But however quietly its white glassy surface rested, there was still a motion on the shore, as its waves rose and fell like the breast of a sleeping child. ""The water rolls on without weariness,"" she said, till all that is hard becomes smooth; so will I be unwearied in my task. Thanks for your lessons, bright rolling waves; my heart tells me you will lead me to my dear brothers."". Eliza saw eleven white swans with golden crowns on their heads, flying towards the land, one behind the other, like a long white ribbon. The swans alighted quite close to her and flapped their great white wings. As soon as the sun had disappeared under the water, the feathers of the swans fell off, and eleven beautiful princes, Eliza's brothers, stood near her. She sprang into their arms, and called them each by name. Then, how happy the princes were at meeting their little sister again, for they recognized her, although she had grown so tall and beautiful. They laughed, and they wept, and very soon understood how wickedly their mother had acted to them all.. We have permission to visit out home once in every year, and to remain eleven days, during which we fly across the forest to look once more at the palace where our father dwells, and where we were born, and at the church, where our mother lies buried. Here it seems as if the very trees and bushes were related to us. The wild horses leap over the plains as we have seen them in our childhood. We have passed whole nights upon it, or we should never have reached our beloved fatherland, for our flight across the sea occupies two of the longest days in the year. If the sea is rough, the foam dashes over us, yet we thank God even for this rock; we have passing whole nights on it. If we should be flying towards the clouds at the time we recovered our natural shape as men, we would sink deep into the sea.. Eliza was awakened by the rustling of the swans' wings as they soared above. Her brothers were again changed to swans, and they flew in circles wider and wider, till they were far away. But one of them, the youngest swan, remained behind, and laid his head in his sister's lap, while she stroked his wings. They remained together the whole day. Towards evening, the rest came back, and as the sun went down they resumed their natural forms. ""To-morrow,"" said one, ""we shall fly away, not to return again till a whole year has passed. But we cannot leave you here."" ""How can I break this spell?"" said their sister. ""We have neither ship nor boat."". ""Yes, take me with you,"" said Eliza. Then they spent the whole night in weaving a net with the pliant willow and rushes. Eliza laid herself down on the net, and when the sun rose, and her brothers again became wild swans, they took up the net with their beaks. The sunbeams fell on her face, therefore one of the swans soared over her head, so that his broad wings might shade her. They were far from the land when Eliza woke. She thought she must still be dreaming, it seemed so strange to her to feel herself being carried so high in the air over the sea. By her side lay a branch full of beautiful ripe berries, and a bundle of sweet roots; the youngest of her brothers had gathered them for her, and placed them by her side.. The swans were so high that a large ship beneath them looked like a white sea-gull skimming the waves. A great cloud floating behind them appeared like a vast mountain, and upon it Eliza saw her own shadow and those of the eleven swans, looking gigantic in size. Altogether it formed a more beautiful picture than she had ever seen; but as the sun rose higher, and the clouds were left behind, the shadowy picture vanished away. Onward the whole day they flew through the air like a winged arrow, yet more slowly than usual, for they had their sister to carry. The weather seemed inclined to be stormy, and Eliza watched the sinking sun with great anxiety, for the little rock in the ocean was not yet in sight.. Eliza and her brothers were flying over the sea when they came to a rock. They darted down so swiftly that Eliza thought they were falling. The rock was so small that it shone only like a star when they reached it. The sisters sat holding each other's hands and singing hymns. At sunrise the swans flew away from the rock with Eliza. The story was written by Eliza's brother, who was a sailor. The book was published by William Morrow in 18th century England, and is available on Kindle and other e-readers. For more information, visit www.amazon.co.uk/The-Swans-Of-The-Sea-The Story of Eliza-and-Her-Brothers.. Eliza saw before her, floating on the air, a range of mountains, with shining masses of ice on their summits. She asked if this was the land to which they were hastening. The swans shook their heads, for what she beheld were the beautiful ever-changing cloud palaces of the ""Fata Morgana,"" into which no mortal can enter. Eliza was still gazing at the scene, when mountains, forests, and castles melted away, and twenty stately churches rose in their stead. She even fancied she could hear the tones of the organ, but it was the music of the murmuring sea which she heard.. ""Heaven grant that I may dream how to save you,"" she replied. As they drew nearer to the churches, they also changed into a fleet of ships, which seemed to be sailing beneath her. So there continued to pass before her eyes a constant change of scene, till at last she saw the real land to which they were bound. And this thought took such hold upon her mind that she prayed earnestly to God for help, and even in her sleep she continued to pray. ""Now we shall expect to hear what you dream of to-night,"" said the youngest brother, as he showed his sister her bedroom.. The girl was told by a fairy that the brothers could be released. She was told to gather stinging nettle and flax, which she could spin and weave into coats. The coats could be thrown over the heads of eleven swans, and the spell broken. The girl was then taken to the palace of the ""Fata Morgana"" and told of the swans with golden crowns on their heads. The story was told in a book called ""The Book of the Swans"" by the same name, which is published in the U.S. by Simon & Schuster, Inc. and is published by Hodder & Stoughton, Ltd., London, priced £8.99. For more information, visit www.hodgerandstoughton.com.. ""Remember all I have told you. The first word you utter will pierce through the hearts of your brothers like a deadly dagger"" ""Remember that you must not speak until you have finished"" ""Do not forget that you are not allowed to speak until after you have completed your task"" ""Don't forget that the first word that you utter is not to speak, but to remember that the last word is to speak."" ""Remember, that the only thing that matters is that you do not speak"" ""The first word"" is the first thing that happens. ""The second word"" is the last. ""You are not permitted to speak after this."" ""The third word is the final word"" ""This is the word that matters"". Eliza kept to her work all night, for she could not rest till she had released her dear brothers. One coat was already finished and she had begun the second, when she heard the huntsman's horn. The sound came nearer and nearer, she hearing the dogs barking, and fled with terror into the cave. She hastily bound together the nettles she had gathered into a bundle and sat upon them. Immediately a great dog came bounding towards her out of the ravine, and then another and another; they barked loudly, ran back, andThen came again. In a very few minutes all the huntsmen stood before the cave, and the handsomest of them was the king of the country. He advanced towards her, for he had never seen a more beautiful maiden. But Eliza shook her head.. ""Come with me,"" he said; ""here you cannot remain. If you are as good as you are beautiful, I will dress you in silk and velvet, and I will place a golden crown upon your head"" She wept and wrung her hands, but the king said, ""I wish only for your happiness. A time will come when you will thank me for this."" And then he galloped away over the mountains, holding her before him on this horse, and the hunters followed behind them. As the sun went down, they approached a fair royal city, with churches, and cupolas. On arriving at the castle the king led her into marble halls, where large fountains played, and where the walls and the ceilings were covered with rich paintings. But she. The king declared his intention of making her his bride. The archbishop shook his head, and whispered that the fair young maiden was only a witch. But the king would not listen to this; he ordered the music to sound, the daintiest dishes to be served, and the loveliest maidens to dance. After-wards he led her through fragrant gardens and lofty halls, but not a smile appeared on her lips or sparkled in her eyes. She looked the very picture of grief. Then the king opened the door of a little chamber in which she was to sleep; it was adorned with rich green tapestry, and resembled the cave in which he had found her. On the floor lay the bundle of flax which she had spun from the nettles, and under the ceiling. Eliza saw all these things which lay so near her heart, a smile played around her mouth. She thought of her brothers, and their release made her so joyful that she kissed the king's hand. Then he pressed her to his heart. Very soon the joyous church bells announced the marriage feast, and that the beautiful dumb girl out of the wood was to be made the queen of the country. The marriage was still to take place, and the archbishop himself had to place the crown on the bride's head. In his wicked spite, he pressed the narrow circlet so tightly on her forehead that it caused her pain. But a heavier weight encircled her heart- sorrow for her brothers. She felt not bodily pain. She was not in any pain.. A woman who loved her king loved him with all her heart, and her eyes beamed with the love she dared not speak. She knew that the nettles she wanted to use grew in the churchyard, and that she must pluck them herself. She crept into the garden in the broad moonlight, and passed through the narrow walks and the deserted streets. ""I must venture, I shall not be denied help from heaven,"" she said. ""Oh, what is the pain in my fingers to the torment which my heart endures?"" said she. ""What is the anguish in my hands to the pain of the torment that my heartendures?"" she asked herself. 'Oh! if she had only been able to confide in him'. Eliza saw on one of the broad tombstones a group of ghouls. She prayed silently, gathered the burning nettles, and carried them home with her to the castle. One person only had seen her, and that was the archbishop- he was awake while everybody was asleep. Now he thought his opinion was evidently correct. All was not right with the queen. She was a witch, and had bewitched the king and all the people. Secretly he told the king what he had seen and what he feared, and as the hard words came from his tongue, the carved images of the saints shook their heads as if they would say. ""It is not so. Eliza is innocent."". Eliza saw the king's brow become darker, and did not understand the reason. Her hot tears glittered like pearls on the regal velvet and diamonds. All who saw her were wishing they could be queens. She thought with terror of the solitary walk, and of the horrible ghouls. But her will was firm, as well as her trust in Providence. Eliza went, and the king and the archbishop followed her. The king's tears rolled down his cheeks, and he went home with doubt in his heart, and at night he pretended to sleep, but there came no real sleep to his eyes, for he saw Eliza get up every night and disappear.. Eliza was condemned by every one to suffer death by fire. She was led to a dark, dreary cell, where the wind whistled through the iron bars. The street-boys sang jeering songs about her, and not a soul comforted her with a kind word. Towards evening, she heard at the grating the flutter of a swan's wing, it was her youngest brother- he had found his sister. She sobbed for joy, although she knew that very likely this would be the last night she would have to live. She continued her task with joy, and prayed for help, while the street-boy's sang jeers about her. The king turned away his head, for he thought she was with them- she whose head had rested on his breast.. Eliza's task was almost finished, and her brothers were come. The archbishop arrived, to be with her during her last hours. But she shook her head, and begged him, by looks and gestures, not to stay. She knew she must finish her task, otherwise all her pain and tears and sleepless nights would have been suffered in vain. The thrush sat outside the grating of the window, and sang to her the whole night long, as sweetly as possible, to keep up her spirits. The eleven brothers stood at the castle gate, and demanded to be brought before the king. They were told it could not be, it was yet almost night, and as the king slept they dared not disturb him.. ""The eleven brothers were seen no more, but eleven wild swans flew away over the castle,"" says Shakespeare. The mob jeered her and said, ""See the witch, how she mutters! She has no hymn-book in her hand. She sits there with her ugly sorcery. Let us tear it in a thousand pieces."" The king himself, inquiring what all the noise meant, asked the guard and even the king himself. At this moment the sun rose. The eleven brothers died, and the witch was burnt. But at the same moment eleven wild Swans flew over her, and alighted on the cart. The ten coats of mail lay at her feet, she was working hard at the eleventh, while the mob jeering her.. ""It is a sign from heaven that she is innocent,"" whispered many of them. Then they flapped their large wings, and the crowd"

'I know every stone of it' 'I have seen it all' 'It's a beautiful place' says the poet. 'It was a beautiful house' 'The most beautiful house in the world' says another. 'And the most beautiful woman' says a third. 'He knew more than the mere chasing of a stag, or the emptying of a flagon' 'He was a man of the people' - the poet's words. 'A man who knew his way around a house, and his way through a village' 'And he knew how to make it a home' 'A home of his own' - he says. 'His wife' - 'his wife. 'I did not see here, as in other old noble castles the highborn lady sitting among her maidens in the great hall turning the spinning-wheel. No, she played upon the ringing lute, and sang to its tones. Her songs were not always the old Danish ditties, however, but songs in foreign tongues' 'They were rich and aristocratic people, and they were born and bred in wealth! Whew!—whew!—fare away!' 'I remember their names well. They were Ida, Johanna and Anna Dorothea. She had brought much gold and silver plate into the house with her, and the cellars were full of German ale, when there was anything there at all'. 'Here were arrogance and ostentation enough and to spare; plenty of lords, but the Lord had no place there,' said the wind. The young bachelors of the neighbourhood came out and collected faggots and branches, the longest and driest they could find. These they took to the town, piled them up in a heap, and set fire to them. Then the men and maidens danced and sang round the bonfire. I lay still,' said. the wind, 'but I softly moved a branch, the one laid by the handsomest young man, and his billet blazed up highest of all' 'He was the chosen one, he had the name of honour, he became 'Buck of the Street!' and he chose from among the girls his little May-lamb!'. 'The great lady came driving towards the Hall, in her gilded chariot drawn by six horses. She had her three dainty daughters with her; they were indeed three lovely flowers. A rose, a lily and a pale hyacinth. The mother herself was a gorgeous tulip' 'Whew! —whew!—fare away! Yes, the chariot bore them away, and the peasants whirled on in their dance' 'Their mates would be proud knights—perhaps even princes!' 'Their May-lambs were they one day to become, thought I; their mates would become proud knights'. 'But that night when I rose,' said the wind, 'the noble lady laid herself down to rise no more' Waldemar Daa stood grave and silent for a time; ""The proudest tree may bend, but it does not break,"" said something within him. The daughters wept, and every one else at the Castle was wiping their eyes; but Madam Daa had fared away, and I fared away too! Whew!—whew!' said theWind. They played at ""Riding the Summer into the village,"" to Borreby village, Tareby village,. and many others. The ospreys and the wood pigeons used to build in it, the blue raven and even the black stork! It was early in the year;. Waldemar Daa was about to build a costly ship, a three-decked man-of-war, which it was expected the king would buy. So the wood fell, the ancient landmark of the seaman, the home of the birds. The shrike was frightened away; its nest was torn down; the osprey and all the other birds lost their nests too, and they flew about distractedly, shrieking in their terror and anger. Anna Dorothea, touched by their distress, begged them with tears in her eyes to spare the tree with the black stork's nest, out of which the young ones were sticking their heads. The crows and the jackdaws screamed in mockery, Caw! caw! So the tree was allowed to stand.. 'The chopping and the sawing went on—the three-decker was built. The master builder was a man of humble origin, but of noble loyalty' 'The fiery black horses stood neighing in the stables; they were worth looking at, and they were looked at to some purpose too' 'What business has a sparrow in a crane's nest? Whew! whew! I rushed away, and he rushed away' 'I was a little thing. It was only a little things. I was not a big thing' 'He was a poor bird, and what business has he been? I was a small thing. He was not big enough. I am a small person. I should not have been a master builder' 'It was a good thing that he was a. An admiral was sent from the King to look at the new man-of-war, with a view to purchasing it. Waldemar Daa wanted gold; the admiral wanted the black horses, and so he praised them as he did. But his hints were not taken, therefore the ship remained unsold. There it stood by the shore covered up with boards, like a Noah's Ark which never reached the water. It was a miserable business. Whew! whew! get along! get Along! It was the worst of all times. I heard all he said,' added the wind. 'I went through the open door with the gentlemen and scattered the straw like gold before their feet'. 'The daughters were still young. Little Ida, the rose, as lovely to look at as when the shipbuilder turned his gaze upon her' 'I whirled the snow about till it lay in great heaps round the ship. I let it hear my voice, and all that a storm has to say, I know that I did my best to give it an idea of the sea' 'Winter and summer passed away! They come and go just as I do!' 'Whew! whew! they pass away, as men pass too!' 'The forest which had disappeared, and the many precious birds' nests which had been devastated, leaving old and young homeless' 'All for the sake of this old piece of lumber, the proud ship'. Anna Dorothea, the pale hyacinth, was only a child of 14. She held herself as stiffly erect as her mother, and seemed to have the same dread of bending her stem. She liked to walk in the long gallery where the family portraits hung. The ladies were painted in velvet and silk, with tiny pearl embroidered caps on their braided tresses. Their husbands were all clad in steel, or in costly cloaks lined with squirrel skins and stiff blue ruffs; their swords hung loosely by their sides. Where would Johanna's portrait one day hang on these walls? What would her noble husband look like? These were her thoughts, and she even spoke them aloud; I heard her as I swept through the long corridor into the gallery, where I veered. 'Away with you, away! I sang in the back of the chimney,' he said. 'You will burn yourself up in it' 'This was why his chimney flamed and smoked and sparkled. Yes, I was there, too,' said the woman. 'I was there too' 'I saw you, and I heard you, but I could not tell you anything' 'You were there, and you saw me, but you did not tell me anything.' 'You saw me and I saw you,' he told her. 'But I did not say anything.' ""I saw her and I knew she was there,"" he said, 'and I saw her smile."" ""I knew her smile,"" he added, 'but I could never tell you what it was."". 'I blew through the castle gate like a watchman blowing his horn, but there was no watchman,' said the wind. 'A smoking chimney means a cooking meal, but the only chimney which smoked here swallowed up all the meals, all for the sake of the red gold' 'The fiery steeds in the stable, where were they? The old gold and silver plate in cupboard and chest, where was that?' 'The cattle, the land, the castle itself? Yes, they could all be melted down in the crucible, but yet no gold would come. Whew! whew! away with it! But Waldemar Daa could not let it go' 'I twisted round the weather-cock on the tower and it creaked as if the watchman. 'I whistled through the broken panes and fissures; I blew into the daughters' chests where their clothes lay faded and threadbare,' said the wind. 'I snowed them up, for they said it gave warmth. They had no firewood, for the forest was cut down where they should have got it. There was a biting frost. Even I had to keep rushing through the crannies and passages to keep myself lively' 'A lordly life became a woeful life! I was the only one to sing in the castle now' said theWind. 'So I know all about it. The doors fell off their hinges, cracks and crannie appeared everywhere; I went in and out' 'I was theonly one to singing in the castles now'. Waldemar Daa had watched through the night with his blood at fever pitch; boiling and cooling, mixing and distilling. I heard him sigh like a despairing soul; I heard he pray, and I felt that he held his breath. The castle is mortgaged, we are in extremities—and yet the gold will come—at Easter!"" He heard him murmur to the spider's web: ""You clever little weaver! You teach me to persevere!"" He said: ""If your web is broken, you begin at the beginning again and complete it! Broken again—and cheerfully you begin it over again"" That is what one must do, and one will be rewarded!"". 'Look at the alchemist's glass! something twinkles in it; it is glowing, pure and heavy' 'I blew up the embers and they shone upon his ashen face, which took a tinge of colour from their light' 'His eyes started in their sockets, they grew larger and larger, as if they would leap out' 'He reeled, and I could easily have blown him over,' said the wind, 'but I only blew upon the ember' 'The last bubble of his welfare was shattered too' 'It was the end of his life, and the beginning of a new one for me' 'There was a time when I thought I would never see my wife again' 'But now I know that I will see her again'. 'Late in the year, when the days were short and dark up here, and the fog envelops the red berries and bare branches with its cold moisture, I came along in a lively mood clearing the sky and snapping off the dead boughs. This is no great labour, it is true, yet it has to be done. Whew! whew! fare away! and away I rushed from the goldmaker's home,' he writes. 'I did my best to prevent Herr Ové taking a fancy to stay there,' he adds.. Ida and Anna Dorothea faced it bravely, although they shed some tears. Johanna stood pale and erect and bit her finger till it bled! Much that would help her! Ové Ramel offered to let them stay on at the Castle for Waldemar Daa's lifetime, but he got no thanks for his offer. I saw the ruined gentleman stiffen his neck and hold his head higher than ever. I beat against the walls and the old linden trees with such force that the thickest branch broke, although it was not a bit rotten. It fell across the gate like a broom, as if some one was about to sweep; and a sweeping there was indeed to be. It was a grievous day and a hard time for them, but their wills were as stubborn as their necks were stiff. Waldemar Daa hid it in his bosom, took his staff in his hand, and, with his three daughters, the once wealthy gentleman walked out of Borreby Hall for the last time. I blew a cold blast upon his burning cheeks, I fluttered his grey beard and his long white hair; I sang such a tune as only I could sing. Whew! whew! away with them! away With them! This was the end of all their grandeur. They walked along the road where once they used to ride in their chariot. They trod it now as vagrants, on their way to a plastered cottage on Smidstrup Heath, which was rented at ten marks yearly. The elder took the younger by the hand, And out they roamed to a far-off land.. 'So they took up their abode in the plastered cottage on Smidstrup Heath, and I tore off over marshes and meadows, through naked hedges and bare woods, to the open seas and other lands' 'The last of them I saw, yes, for the last time, was Anna Dorothea, the pale hyacinth. She was old and bent now; it was half a century later' 'What happened to Waldemar Daa? What happened to his daughters? This is what the wind relates' 'I blew into their ears to try and deaden the cries, which after all were not worth listening to'. 'Across the heath, near the town of Viborg, stood the Dean's new, handsome mansion, built of red stone with toothed gables' 'The gentle lady and her fair daughters sat in the bay window looking into the garden at the drooping thorns and out to the brown heath beyond' 'This house was only fit to be looked at, not to be touched. I had to mind what I was about,' said the wind. 'The cottage was allowed to stand for the sake of the stork's nest; in itself it was only a scarecrow on theHeath, but the dean did not want to frighten away the storks' 'She lived the longest, she had gone through everything. She lived the most, she was the most beautiful, the most intelligent, the best-. 'Oh dear! oh dear! No bells rang over the grave of Waldemar Daa. No schoolboys sang when the former lord of Borreby Castle was laid in his grave. Well, everything must have an end, even misery! Sister Ida became the wife of a peasant, and this was her father's sorest trial. His daughter's husband a miserable serf, who might at any moment be ordered the punishment of the wooden horse by his lord. It is well that the sod covers him now, and you too, Ida! Ah yes! ah yes! Poor me! poor me! I still linger on' 'Oh dear!' oh dear!' 'I remember it all! Ah, human beings can sigh as well as the wind'. 'I took charge of the boldest of the sisters,' said the wind. 'She had clothes made to suit her manly disposition, and took a place as a lad with a skipper' 'With all her will she could not climb the rigging; so I blew her overboard before any one discovered that she was a woman, and I fancy that was not a bad deed of mine!' 'On such an Easter morning as that on which Waldemar Daa thought he had found the red gold, I heard from beneath the stork's nest a psalm echoing through the miserable walls. It was Anna Dorothea's last song. There was no window; only a hole in the wall. The sun rose in splendour and poured in upon her; her eyes were glazed and her heart broken!' 'In Thy mercy release me, O Christ!'. 'The old order changeth, giving place to the new. The stork kept a roof over her head till her death! I sang at her grave,' said the wind, 'and I sang in her father's grave' 'I know where it is, and hers too, which is more than any one else knows' 'This is the story of Waldemar Daa and his daughters. Tell it better yourselves, if you can' 'Whew! whew! Let us be gone!'"
0.42,0.52,37.681398416886545,"The region round the little town of Kjøge is very bleak and cold. The town lies on the sea shore, which is always beautiful. But here it might be more beautiful than it is, for on every side the fields are flat, and it is a long way to the forest. But when persons reside in a place and get used to it, they can always find something beautiful in it. Even in the most charming spot in the world which is not home, there is something beautiful there.. The boy was so afraid of the water that nothing could entice him to join them. They jeered and laughed at him, and he was obliged to bear it all as patiently as he could. Once the neighbor’s little girl, Joanna, dreamed that she was sailing in a boat, and the boy waded out in the water to join her. When little Knud heard this dream, it seemed as if he could not bear the mocking and jeering again. He never. Knud and Joanna were fond of sitting under the willow-tree in the garden. The town had a large market-place, and at the fair-time there would be whole rows of tents and booths. The man who sold these cakes always lodged with little Knud’s parents. So every now and then he had a present of gingerbread, and of course Joanna always had a share.. The author tells the story of two gingerbread cakes who fell in love. The man was a gingerbread man wearing a hat, the maiden was honey cake all over. The story was told to a group of school children. The author says that the children never forgot the story. He says that it is a story that should be told to all children, even if they don't understand it. The writer concludes by saying that the story is not very long.. The gingerbread man dreamed that he was a real street boy, that he possessed four real pennies, and that he had bought the gingerbread lady, and ate her up. But his thoughts were far more ambitious, as the thoughts of a man often are. And so they lay on the counter for days and weeks, till they grew hard. The story was so lovely, and the other children had the same opinion. But when they turned to look at the gingerbread pair, the broken maiden was gone! A great boy, out of wickedness, had eaten her up. They called it, ‘love, because the story wasSo lovely, because they were so happy.’ The story was about a silent love which came to nothing, to a group of children.. The two children still continued to play together by the elder-tree, and under the willow. The little maiden sang beautiful songs, with a voice that was as clear as a bell. Knud, on the contrary, had not a note of music in him, but knew the words of the songs. The people of Kjøge, and even the rich wife of the man who kept the fancy shop, would stand. Knud was bound apprentice to a shoemaker; he was growing a great boy, and could not be allowed to run wild any longer. On the day of his confirmation he saw distinctly the golden cross on the principal church glittering in the sun. How often his thoughts were with Joanna! but did she think of him? Yes. About Christmas came a letter from her father to Knud’s parents, which stated that they were going on very well. She sent her dear neighbors at Kjøge a whole dollar, for them to make merry on Christmas eve, and they were to drink her health. She was engaged to. The story was a good lesson to him. He was determined not to play the dumb lover as both the gingerbread cakes had done. He wanted to buy a gold ring for her in Kjøge, but then he recollected how far more beautiful such things would be in Copenhagen. He prepared for a journey to Copenhagen, with his knapsack packed and ready. A master was expecting him there, and how glad she would be to see him.. The author was a journeyman from the town of his birth in Norway. When he arrived at his new master’s in the great metropolis, he was wet through. He found the house that he sought easily, but had to mount so many stairs that he became quite giddy. It surprised him to find how people lived over one another in this dreadful town.. Knud's father told him that his daughter had grown up and had her own room. He said she was quite grown up, and very different from what Knud had fancied her. She was a great deal more beautiful than he had imagined. The father said he would see her presently, and they went in to her room. The room was full of carpets, and rugs, and window curtains hanging to the ground.. In all Kjøge there was not a girl like her; and how graceful she looked, although her glance at first was odd, and not familiar. For a moment only, then she rushed towards him as if she would have kissed him; she did not, however, although she was very near it. Then she asked so many questions about Knud’s parents, and everything. Knud was invited by her parents to remain the whole evening with them. Joanna was not proud at all. She poured out the tea and gave him a cup herself. Knud and Joanna worked by candle-light in their home in Norway. Knud visited Joanna every evening after working hours. Joanna sang a simple song, which, through her singing, became a true story. The song made Knud's heart swell with joy. He could not sleep after the song; he did not sleep for days.. Knud saw the shadow of her face quite plainly on the window blind. His master’s wife did not like his always going out in the evening, idling, wasting time, as she called it. But his master only smiled, and said, “He is a young man, my dear, you know.. Knud was invited out to spend the evening with his family. Joanna asked if he had ever been to the theatre. She sent him a ticket to go and see it. He saw Joanna, and how beautiful and charming she looked. But that was all in the play, and only a pretence. Knud well knew that. She could never have the heart, he thought, to send him aticket to go. Knud felt as if the whole room was whirling round with him. His courage failed, and he felt asIf his heart would burst. He looked on, and when all the people applauded and clapped their hands, he shouted “hurrah” He could see that even the king smiled at Joanna, and seemed delighted with her singing. How small Knud felt; but then he loved her so dearly, and thought she loved him, and the man must speak the. “You honest, faithful soul,” she exclaimed; and the words loosened Knud’s tongue, and he told her how truly he had loved her, and that she must be his wife. She let his hand fall, and said, earnestly and mournfully, “Knud, do not make yourself and me unhappy.”. Knud felt as if the world had slid out of its course. His thoughts were like a loose thread fluttering to and fro in the wind. He stayed, although he could not tell whether she had asked him to do so. But she was kind and gentle to him; she poured out his tea, and sang to him. But the song had not the old tone in it, although it was wonderfully beautiful. And then he rose to go. He did not offer his. Knud was a young man when he met Joanna in a dancing-room. He saw many handsome girls there, but none like Joanna. As the violins played and the girls danced round the room, he started. It seemed to him as if he were in a place where he ought not to have brought Joanna, for she was here with him in his heart. But the world went on its course, and Knud was obliged to go on too.. Nuremberg is a wonderful old city, and looks as if it had been cut out of an old picture-book. The streets seem to have arranged themselves according to their own fancy. Gables, with little towers, ornamented columns, and statues, can be seen even to the city gate. From the singular-shaped roofs, waterspouts, formed like dragons, extend far across to the middle of the street.. The old town of Nuremberg is still standing, but the walls have been converted into a series of small gardens. The old town was once home to the city's first inhabitants, who lived in the area around the town hall. The town is now a tourist attraction, and the city is still popular with tourists. The city is also home to a number of famous landmarks, including the Nuremburg Cathedral and the Stadthalle.. Knud left his master, and went to work for another who lived farther in the town, where no elder grew. Here he dwelt through one summer and winter, but when spring came again, he could endure it no longer. The elder was in blossom, and its fragrance was so homelike, that he fancied himself back again in the gardens of Kjøge. Yes, he had indeed gone from elder-mother. The old childish story of the two cakes had a deep meaning for him. He understood now why the gingerbread man had a bitter almond in his left side. His was the feeling of bitterness, and Joanna, so mild and friendly, was represented by the honeycake maiden. As he thought upon all this, the strap of his knapsack pressed across his chest so that he could hardly breathe. He saw but half the world around him; the other half he carried with him in his inward thoughts.. The Alps appeared to him like the wings of earth folded together; unfolded, they would display the variegated pictures of dark woods, foaming waters, spreading clouds, and masses of snow. “At the last day,” thought he, “the earth will unfold its great wings, and soar upwards to the skies”. Knud thought of the water-mill at Kjøge, with its rushing, foaming waters. He wandered on, treading upon Alpine roses, thistles, and snow, with the summer sun shining upon him. He bid farewell to the lands of the north, and returned to his home.. The author was a journeyman in Milan, Italy. He was employed by an old, pious couple. The city seemed to him to have been formed from the snow of his native land. The author was inspired to write a book about his experiences. The book is called ""The Journeyman"" and is published by Hodder & Stoughton, at £16.99.. The author was taken to the opera by his master, who took him to see the sights of Milan. The opera house was filled with elegantly-dressed ladies and gentlemen. The place was so brilliantly lighted that it seemed like sunshine, and glorious music rolled through the building. The author had no longing to go to the church of Kjøge, with its red, ivy-clad walls, but he had no desire to. ""It was like magic,"" says the author, ""for, when the curtain rose, there stood Joanna, dressed in silk and gold, and with a golden crown upon her head"" She sang, he thought, as only an angel could sing; and then she stepped forward to the front and smiled, asonly Joanna could smile. All the audience applauded her, and threw wreaths of flowers at her; and every time she. Knud was in the foremost row, and shouted as joyously as the rest. When the carriage stopped before a brilliantly lighted house, Knud placed himself close to the door of her carriage. A man, with a glittering star on his breast, gave her his arm, and people said the two were engaged to be married. Knud looked straight in her face, and she looked at him, but she did not. He said he could easily follow the track of the closely-moving carriages, for which a path must be kept clear. So he turned his steps to the mountains, ascended one side and descended the other, still going northward till his strength began to fail. The lights in the valley grew brighter and brighter, and more numerous, and he could see them moving to and fro. Then he understood that there must be a village in the distance; so he exerted. The story of Knud, a man who longed to return to his home in the north. He travelled for many days with hasty steps, as if he were trying to reach home before all whom he remembered should die. No one would have believed or understood this sorrow of his heart, the deepest that can be felt by human nature. Such grief is not for the world; it is not entertaining even to friends.. The story is about a boy who returns to his childhood garden in Kjøge. He dreams that the willow-tree from Kjæge has found him and carried him back. The tree looks like a strong, old man, like the “willow-father” himself.. The two gingerbread cakes, the man and the woman, who had shown their best sides to the world and looked so good. “We thank you,” they said to Knud, “for you have loosened our tongues” “Now something has come of our thoughts, for we are engaged to be married.” They turned their steps to the church, and Knud and Joanna followed them..

""Oh, how my heart leaped up with joy! Here was a well-known face at last,"" writes the author. ""Just paint the scenes I describe to you,"" he said to her, ""and you will have a very pretty picture-book"" ""I could make up a new ""Thousand and One Nights,"" in my own way, out of these pictures,"" she says. ""But the number might be too great, after all,"" she adds. ""I have followed his injunction for many evenings,"" she writes. ""It is a pity that he can only stay such a short time when he comes."" ""I love you, Moon,"" she replies. ""You are a good friend to me,"" he replies. 'I loveYou, Moon,' she says, ""you are a very good friend."" ""You're a good, good friend,"" he says, 'and I love you too."" 'You are my friend,' she replies, 'I am your friend.'. The Moon's words were quoted in this letter. The pictures are not chosen at random, but follow in their proper order. Some great gifted painter, or some poet or musician, may make something more of them if he likes. They are only hasty sketches, hurriedly put upon the paper, with some of my own thoughts, interspersed; for the Moon did not come to me every evening—a cloud sometimes hid his face from me. ""Last night I was gliding through the cloudless Indian sky. My face was mirrored in the waters of the Ganges"" ""I am quoting the Moon's own words. I am quoting his own words."" ""I have given you some of the most beautiful pictures I have ever seen"" ""They are not random, they are not in any order, but just as they were described to me"". The girl's black sparkling eyes, half veiled behind their long silken lashes, followed it with a gaze of earnest intensity. She knew that if the lamp continued to burn so long as she could keep it in sight, her betrothed was still alive. But if the flame was suddenly extinguished, he was dead. And the lamp burned bravely on, and she fell on her knees, and prayed. Near her in the grass lay a speckled snake, but she heeded it not. She thought only of Bramah and of herbetrothed. She came down to the stream, and set the lamp upon the water, and let it float away. The flame flickered to and fro, and seemed ready to expire; but still the lamp burning on. The girl's eyes followed the flame with an earnest intensity, and her finger tips spread them for a screen before it.. ""Yesterday,"" said the Moon to me, ""I looked down upon a small courtyard surrounded on all sides by houses. In the courtyard sat a clucking hen with eleven chickens; and a pretty little girl was running and jumping around them. The hen was frightened, and screamed, and spread out her wings over the little brood. Then the girl's father came out and scolded her; and I glided away and thought no more of the matter"" ""But this evening, only a few minutes ago, I looked down into the same courtyard. Everything was quiet. But presently the little girl came forth again, crept quietly to the hen-house, pushed back the bolt, and slipped into the apartment of the hen and chickens"" ""And from the mountains the echo came back upon her, 'he lives!"". ""In the narrow street round the corner yonder—it is so narrow that my beams can only glide for a minute along the walls of the house"" Sixteen years ago that woman was a child, playing in the garden of the old parsonage, in the country. The hedges of rose-bush were old, and the flowers were faded. ""And the father kissed the innocent child's forehead, and I kissed her on the mouth and eyes."" ""I was angry with the willful child, and felt glad when her father came out and scolded her more violently than yesterday"" ""I wanted to kiss the hen and beg her pardon for frightening her yesterday; but I was afraid to tell you."" ""In that minute I see enough to learn what the world is made of—in that narrow street. ""There are tragedies in every-day life, and tonight I saw the last act of one,"" writes the author. ""She was lying in bed in a house in that narrow street: she was sick unto death, and the cruel landlord came up, and tore away the thin coverlet, her only protection against the cold"" ""I rejoiced at her happiness, and sought her on calm quiet evenings—ah, nobody thinks of my clear eye and my silent glance! Alas! my rose ran wild, like the rose bushes in the garden of the parsonage,"" he writes. ""I saw her again. She was the beautiful bride of a rich merchant. I beheld her in a splendid ballroom: she had been married to a clergyman's little daughter."" ""I was a man of letters, and I was a poet, and a writer, and an artist,"" he adds. ""I looked at her, and she was sitting motionless, with her hands in her lap,"" said the Moon. ""The curtain caught fire, and the flames played about her face,"" he said.

A young nobleman and his lady were present at the performance. But under the chandelier was a vacant space like a little crater. Not a single soul sat there, for the tallow was dropping, drip, drip! I saw everything, for it was so warm in there that every loophole had been opened. The male and female servants stood outside, peeping through the chinks, although a real policeman was inside, threatening them with a stick. A policeman was in the house, threatening the servants with a Stick. The play was going to begin, and I saw it all. I saw the whole thing. It was a wonderful experience. I was in a state of ecstasy. I felt like I had been in a dream. I could not believe it. I had never seen such a thing before. I have never seen anything like it.. ""Yesterday,"" began the Moon, ""I looked down upon the turmoil of Paris. My eye penetrated into an apartment of the Louvre. An old grandmother, poorly clad, was following one of the under-servants into the great empty throne-room"" ""I was present at the performance from beginning to end,"" said the Moon.

The story is based on a true story of a woman's visit to the throne room of the king. The woman was weeping as she saw the rich velvet and gold-laced throne. She said that her grandson had died on the throne, but that it was not the same as the one in the play. The play is set in Paris in the 17th century. The author is a friend of the play's author, and has written a book about the story. The book is called ""The Death of the King of France"" and is published by Paternoster Square Press.. ""It happened, in the Revolution of July, on the evening of the most brilliantly victorious day, when every house was a fortress, every window a breastwork,"" he said. ""A poor half-grown boy in a ragged blouse fought among the older insurgents. Mortally wounded with several bayonet thrusts, he sank down. They laid the bleeding youth upon the throne of France, wrapped the velvet around his wounds, and his blood streamed forth upon the imperial purple,"" he added. ""The evening twilight faded and my light shone doubly vivid upon the rich velvet that covered the throne,"" he concluded.. ""My beams have kissed the wreath of immortelles on his grave, and this night they kissed the forehead of the old grandame,"" said the poet. ""The poor boy on the throne of France"" was a dream the mother's heart dreamt of a second Napoleon. ""I looked down upon the great plain covered with coarse grass, and upon the barren fields,"" he said. ""And I mirrored my face in the Tyris river, while the steamboat drove the fish into the rushes."" ""I've been in Upsala,"" said he said, ""and I've been to the Moon."" ""And the Moon"" said the Moon, ""I have been to Upsala"" ""And now I'm going to the moon,"" he added, ""where I'll be with my wife and children."". ""Up on the hill stood a man, a poet.

He spoke not a word, but his eyes sparkled. He began to whistle. At this the nightingales sang louder than ever. And last of all came a poor girl. She laid aside the burden she carried, and sat down to rest upon the Hun's Grave. Her pale handsome face was bent in a listening attitude towards the forest"" (p. 6) ""That will make a beautiful picture,' he said.

""I know that this minute, and the beautiful natural scene, will live within her memory for years, far more vividly and more truly than the painter could portray it with his colours on paper"" ""Her eyes brightened, she gazed earnestly at the sea and the sky, her hands were folded, and I think she prayed, 'Our Father.' She herself could not understand the feeling that swept through her, but I know that she will remember this minute for years. My rays followed her till the morning dawn kissed her brow."" ""My thoughts flew far away, up to my great friend, who every evening told me such pretty tales, and showed me pictures.

""I have followed the polar bird and the swimming whale to the eastern coast of Greenland. There was a glancing light, and a beam from the Moon fell upon me.

Tonight I can draw no picture of the memories of thy visit"" ""I have been to Greenland, and I have seen the polar birds and the. swimming whale. Listen to what he told me. I have followed them to the east coast of. Greenland. They have told me what they have seen and heard."" ""I am going to Greenland and I will see the polarirds and the whale. I will also see the Greenlanders."". The Northern Light was a crown-shaped light that burned fiercely in the sky. The inhabitants of that icy region were assembling for dance and festivity. 'Let us leave the soul of the dead to their ball-play with the heads of the walruses,' they thought in their superstition, and they turned their whole attention to the song and dance. The Northern Light is a crown that burns fiercely in. the sky, and from its circumference the rays shot like whirling shafts of fire across the whole sky, flashing in changing radiance from green to red. The people of that region are accustomed to this glorious spectacle, but, accustomed to it, they scarcely deigned to glance at. ""A Court of Judgment was opened. In the midst of the circle, and divested of his furry cloak, stood a Greenlander, with a small pipe, and he played and sang a song about catching the seal, and the chorus around chimed in with, 'Eia, Eia, Ah' And in their white furs they danced about in the circle,. till you might fancy it was a polar bear's ball. The defendant replied with satire as keen, while the audience laughed, and gave their verdict. The rocks heaved, the glaciers melted, and great masses of ice and snow came crashing down, shivering to fragments as they fall. A hundred paces away, under the open tent of hides, lay a sick man. A 100 paces. away. A man dies, and his wife asks him to be buried in the sea. He says he would rather be buried on a rock, in the firm snow, than in the ocean. 'In the sea,' he says, 'it is a pleasant summer tent, the sea' 'Thousands of seals sport there, the walrus shall lie at thy feet, and the hunt will be safe and merry!' The children tore the outspread hide from the window-hole, that the dead man might be carried to the ocean, that had given him food in life, and that now, in death, was to afford him a place of rest. He was buried on the rock, with a kayak and arrows, and angekokk shall dance over it.. ""I knew an old maid,"" said the Moon. ""Every winter she wore a wrapper of yellow satin, and it always remained new, and was the only fashion she followed"" ""She never went out, except across the street to an old female friend,"" he said. ""During the last months I saw her no more at the window, but she was still alive"" ""Yes, yes,"" she was in the habit of saying, when I come to die I shall take a longer journey than I have made my whole life long,"" he added. ""I knew that, for I had not yet seen her begin the 'long journey,' of which she often spoke with her friend"" ""For his monument, he had the floating, ever-changing icebergs, whereon the seal sleeps, while the storm bird flies round their gleaming summits!"" ""I verily believe the very same gray-blue dress.. 'Last night a van stopped at the house. A coffin was carried out, and then I knew that she was dead' 'Our family vault is six miles from here. I shall be carried there, and shall sleep there among my family and relatives' 'I fancy he half expected to see her sitting on the coffin, in her yellow satin wrapper' 'Because he was startled, he foolishly lashed his horses, while he held the reins so tightly that the poor beasts were in a foam' 'A hare jumped across the road and startled them, and they fairly ran away' 'The old sober maiden, who had for years and years moved quietly round and round in a dull circle, was now, in death, rattled over stock and stone on the public highway' 'She had not gone out of her house once for the last year. The van rolled out through the town-gate as briskly as if it were going for a pleasant excursion'. ""I will give you a picture of Pompeii,"" said the Moon. ""I was in the suburb in the Street of Tombs, where the fair monuments stand"" ""The lark rose up carolling from the field, twittering her morning lay over the coffin, and presently perched upon it, picking with her beak at the straw covering, as though she would tear it up"" ""I withdrew behind the red morning clouds,"" said he. ""And the lark arose up again, singing gaily, and I withdrew"" ""And I withdrew,"" he said, ""and the larks rose up again"" "" and the larkin rose up,"" said she, "" and I withdrawn."" ""And so it is with all of us,"" he added, ""that we should never forget. ""It was the City of the Dead; only Vesuvius thundered forth his everlasting hymn,"" he wrote. ""Each separate verse of which is called by men an eruption,"" he added. ""The air was transparent and blue, and black Vesuvio formed the background"" The city was ""the city that had risen from the grave illumined by my beams,"" he said. ""It was a city of the dead""; he added, ""and I showed them the wheel-ruts in the streets paved with broad lava slabs"" The author also visited the temple of Venus, where he saw weeping willows sprouting among the pillars. ""Among the company was a lady singer, a real and great singer,"" said the author. ""I saw in the little courtyard the basins of the fountains, ornamented with shells,"" he continued.. The singer gaily mounted the ancient stage, and sang. The place inspired her, and she reminded me of a wild Arab horse. I thought of the mourning mother beneath the cross at Golgotha, so deep was the expression of pain. And, just as it had done thousands of years ago, the sound of applause and delight now filled the theatre. 'Happy, gifted creature!' all the hearers exclaimed. Five minutes more, and the stage was empty, the company had vanished, and not a sound more was heard—all were gone. And so it was with the singer. She was a great singer. I have witnessed the homage paid to her in the greatest cities of Europe. She is a great performer. She has been a great Singer. She will be a great Artist. And she will be an even greater Singer. And I have seen the homage.. ""I looked through the windows of an editor's house,"" said the Moon. ""It was somewhere in Germany"" ""The ruins stood unchanged, as they will stand when centuries shall have gone by"" ""When all will be forgotten and gone, and even for me this hour will be but a dream of the past"" ""I saw handsome furniture, many books, and a chaos of newspapers"" ""It is good enough; a little broad, certainly; but, you see, the author is still young"" ""You can't be always getting something new"" ""There is a good deal of common-place among them"" ""What will you have?"" ""What do you think?"" ""I have not read it yet."" ""What are you going to do with it?"" ""Read it again."" ""I'm going to read it again"". ""We must be lenient towards the young man,"" said the poet. ""He is well read, a remarkable Oriental scholar, and has a good judgment,"" said a friend. ""But he is a complete hack!' objected another of the gentlemen. ""Nothing worse in poetry than mediocrity, and he certainly does not go beyond this,"" said another. ""I suppose the author expects me to purchase it? I hear it is praised. He has genius, certainly: don't you think so?' said the author. ""Yes, all the world declares as much,"" replied the poet, 'but it has turned out rather wildly"" ""I have noticed the book briefly. Undoubted talent—a welcome offering—a flower in the garden of poetry—prettily brought out"". ""I went away,"" continued the Moon, ""and looked through the windows in the aunt's house"" The editor of ""The Sun and the Moon"" wrote that the author had a 'decided talent' for writing. The editor also noted that the punctuation in the book was 'very eccentric' The editor concluded that the writer had a ""real and abundant good that we find here"" The author's work was published in 1855. The first edition was published by Scribner's, with an edition of 2,500 copies. The second edition was released in 1856. The last edition was printed in 1857.. ""I sought the other poet out, the wild one; him also I found in a great assembly at his patron's"" ""I shall read yours also,"" said Maecenas. ""I don't expect much from it, for you are much too wild, too fantastic"" ""It's only the old, old story, But the piece is repeated each day"" ""The Moon said, ""Beside the woodland path there are two small farm-houses"" ""In the dust lies genius and glory, But ev'ry-day talent will pay"" ""There is a story to be told, but it's not a good one"".

""The Story of the Stork and the Baby"" is a children's book by the same name. The book is about a girl and a boy who were told a story about a stork. The girl was told that an angel from heaven brings babies under his cloak, but no man can see him. The boy was told the story about the stork is not true, and that they only tell it to us children for fun. The story is about the girl and the baby, and how they learned to love each other after the story was told to them by a neighbour. The author says that the story is a tale of love, not of angels. The tale is about children and babies, and the story of the baby and the. ""I was gliding over the Luneburg Heath,"" the Moon said.

The story was told to him when he was a little boy, and he has always found it charming. The author has now written his own version of the story, which he will share with you today. He will also tell you that the story is true, and that he has heard it many times.. An old peasant rode into the town on a horse. His neighbors often borrowed it of him, and paid for the loan of it by rendering some service to the old couple. After a time they thought it would be as well to sell the horse, or exchange it for something which might be more useful to them. But what might this something be? ""You'll know best, old man,"" said the wife. ""It is fair-day to-day"". A man came trudging along, and driving a cow to the fair. The cow was as beautiful a creature as any cow could be. The man said: ""I dare say a horse is of more value than a cow"" The man agreed to exchange the cow for the horse. The exchange was made, and the man went on his way. The story was told by a friend of the man.. A peasant saw a good-looking sheep and decided to buy it for his cow. He also saw a man with a large goose, and agreed to exchange it for the goose. The man with the sheep was quite ready, and the bargain was quickly made. And then our peasant continued his way on the high-road with his sheep. Soon after this, he overtook another man, who had come into the road from a field, and was carrying a large Goose under his arm.. The peasant offered to exchange his sheep for a goose. The other had not the least objection. The exchange was made, and the peasant became possessor of the goose. He then returned to his home. The goose was returned to its rightful owner. The peasant then returned home to his family. The story was told in a book called ""The Goose in the Crowd"". A man went to the fair, and wanted something to eat, and a glass of ale to refresh himself. He saw a fowl, and thought, ""Why that's the finest fowl I ever saw in my life"" He asked the toll-keeper to exchange the fowl for his goose. The man got the goose, and the peasant carried off the f bird.. A peasant was about to enter an inn when the ostler came out. The ostler was carrying a sack. ""What have you in that sack?"" asked the peasant. ""A whole sackful of rotten apples,"" answered the ostlers. ""They will do to feed the pigs with"" ""What will you give me for the sackful?"" askedthe peasant.. ""Hiss-s-s, hiss-S-s."" What could that be by the stove? The apples were beginning to roast. ""What is that?"" asked one. ""Why, do you know""- said our peasant. And then he told them the whole story of the horse, which he had exchanged for a cow.. ""We'll wager you a ton of coined gold, a hundred pounds to the hundred-weight,"" said the Englishman. ""No; a bushel will be enough,"" replied the peasant. ""I'll throw myself and my old woman into the bargain,"" said he. ""Done! taken!"" and so the bet was made.. A man traded a cow for a sheep. His wife thought it was a good exchange. He then traded a goose for a fowl. The goose lay eggs and hatch them, and we shall have chickens. The woman thought it had been a capital exchange. The man thought it hadn't been a good swap.. ""Yes, but I exchanged the fowl for a sack of shrivelled apples."" ""What! I really must give you a kiss for that!"" exclaimed the wife. ""My dear, good husband, now I'll tell you something. Do you know, almost as soon as you left me this morning, I began to think of what I could give you nice for supper this. ""Well, I like all this,"" said both the Englishmen; ""always going down the hill, and yet always merry; it's worth the money to see it."" So they paid a hundred-weight of gold to the peasant, who, whatever he did, was not scolded but kissed"
0.39,0.49,36.20564808110065,"American literature is full of crudity, says author. He says it is inevitable. We are not subtle enough to conceal ourselves, he says. The Mississippi Valley is a marvelous story and we have not yet begun to tell the half of it, he writes. He concludes: ""It is a story we must tell"" and we should not be ashamed of it. It is the story of the United States, and we must live it.. ""We have not had faith in our people and in the story of our people,"" he writes. ""We shall never have an American literature until we return to faith in ourselves and to the facing of our own limitations"" ""The telling of the story depends, I believe, upon their learning that lesson and accepting that burden,"" he adds. ""I grow weary of talk and walk in the streets. As I walk alone, an old truth comes home to me and I know that we shall. The writer argues that American literature is not dull, but real and simple. He says Dostoevsky had faith in the simplicity of the Russians and what he achieved. ""We must, in some way, become in ourselves more like our fellows,"" he says. ""There is death on that road and following it has brought death into much of American writing"". The most popular magazine story or novel does not live in our minds for a month. To continue along the road we are travelling is unthinkable. To draw ourselves apart, to live in little groups and console ourselves with the thought that we are achieving intellectuality, is to get nowhere. By such a road we can hope only to go on producing a literature that has nothing to do with life as it is lived in these United States.. American life is 'ugly as modern war', says author. But why is crudity and ugliness necessary, he asks. What we want is the note of health, says Twain. 'A great step forward will have been taken when it is more generally accepted' says Howells. 'If anyone can find beauty in an American factory town, I wish he would show me the way'.  Twain and Whitman wrote out of another age, out of an age and a land of forests and rivers. The dominant note of American life in their time was the noisy, swaggering raftsman and the hairy-breasted woodsman. Why cannot the modern man be also wholesome and sweet? To this I make answer that to me a man, say like Mr. Dreiser, is wholesome. He is true. The writer says there is something approaching insanity in the idea of sinking yourself too deeply into modern American industrial life. We shall, I am sure, have much crude, blundering American writing before the gift of beauty and subtlety in prose shall honestly belong to us, he says. To our grandchildren the privilege of attempting to produce a school of American writing that has delicacy and color may come as a matter of course."
0.73,0.83,65.2073732718894," Belle Carpenter had a dark skin, grey eyes and thick lips. She was tall and strong. When black thoughts visited her she grew angry and wished she were a man and could fight someone with her fists. She worked in the millinery shop kept by Mrs. Nate McHugh and during the day sat trimming hats by a window at the rear of the store. The bookkeeper's life was made up of innumerable little pettinesses. When he went to the bank in the morning he stepped into a closet and put on a black alpaca coat that had become shabby with age. When she was a young girl Henry Carpenter made life almost unbearable for his daughter, but as she emerged from girlhood into womanhood he lost his power over her. He was a bookkeeper in the First National Bank of Winesburg, Ohio, and lived with him in a gloomy. Belle Carpenter was a bank cashier in Winesburg, Pennsylvania. She was secretly in love with George Willard, a reporter on the Winesberg Eagle. She pressed her husband's trousers with boards attached by screws. He hated her for it. She smeared the boards with mud and went back to her work feeling happy. The story was turned into a film, starring David Walliams and Emma Watson. The film was released in 2007. The book is now being published by Simon & Schuster. The movie is called The Last Girl in the City. The first part of the film is available on Blu-ray and DVD. The second part is available in paperback on September 14. The third and final part is released on September 21.. She was in love with Ed Handby, bartender in Ed Griffith's Saloon. She did not think that her station in life would permit her to be seen in the company of the bartender. She walked about under the trees with George Willard and let him kiss her to relieve a longing that was very insistent in her nature. At twenty-five the bartender had inherited a large farm from an uncle in Indiana. When sold the farm brought in eight thousand dollars which Ed spent in six months. Going to Sandusky, on Lake Erie, he began an orgy of dissipation, the story of which afterward filled his home town with awe. He was a tall broad-shouldered man of thirty who lived in a room upstairs above Griffith's saloon.. Ed Handby was a gambler who ran amuck in the streets of New York City. He broke windows and broke chairs in dance halls for the joy of hearing the glass rattle on the floor. Handby's love for Belle Carpenter was so strong that he told her of his desire to marry her. The pair married and had an affair, which on the surface amounted to nothing. But on the inside, the two were in love and he was determined to keep her. He spent the rest of his life trying to earn money for his wife's support. He died in a house fire in New York in 1881, leaving behind a wife and three children. He was buried in a plot of land owned by his family, which he had inherited from his father. He also left behind a large sum of money, which was used to pay for his mistress' house.. Ed Handby was a young reporter in Winesburg, New Hampshire. He met George Willard, who he thought was the only obstacle to his getting Belle Carpenter. Handby says Willard told him he would have her before he got through with her. He says he kissed her until she became helpless and then let her out of the buggy. ""When I get hold of you again I'll not let you go. You can't play with me,"" he declared. ""I'll keep you for good the next time,"" he said. ""You might as well make up your mind to that"" ""It's you and me for it and I'm going to have you before I get through,"" Willard said. 'I'll have you next time,' Handby said.. Art Wilson was learning the barber's trade in Cal Prouse's shop. He began to tell of a night when he with two men from Winesburg went into a house of prostitution at the County Seat. ""The women in the place couldn't embarrass me although they tried hard enough,"" he boasted. ""One of the girls in the house tried to get fresh but I fooled her. As soon as she began to talk I went and sat in her lap. Everyone in the room laughed when I kissed her. I taught her to let me alone."" He said that women should look out for themselves that the fellow who went out with a girl was not responsible for what happened. He held the floor for five minutes and then Art Wilson began to speak.. George went out of the pool room and began walking in dimly lighted streets filled with frame houses. In a spirit of play he reeled along the street imitating a drunken man and then imagined himself a soldier clad in shining boots that reached to the knees and wearing a sword that jingled as he walked. As a soldier he pictured himself as an inspector, passing before a long line of men who stood at attention. Before a tree he stopped and began to scold. ""Your pack is not in order,"" he said sharply. ""How many times will I have to speak of this matter? Everything must be in order here"" The story of George's life is told in the novel, ""A Man Walks On To The Moon,"" by George Gershwin.. George Willard was walking along the street when the thought came to him. He was amazed and delighted with his own mind. He spoke of the matter with fervor. ""There is a law for armies and for men too,"" he muttered. ""The law begins with little things and spreads out until it covers everything"" ""In every little thing there must be order, in the place where men work, in their clothes and in their thoughts,"" he said. ""I myself must be orderly. I must learn that law"" ""I must get myself into touch with something orderly and big that swings through the night like a star,"" he added. ""In my little way I must begin to learn something, to give and swing and work with life, with the law."" ""We have a difficult task before us and no difficult task can be done without order"". In Winesburg, as in all Ohio towns of twenty years ago, there was a section in which day laborers lived. As the time of factories had not yet come the laborers worked in the fields or were section hands on the railroads. They worked twelve hours a day and received one dollar for the long day of toil. The houses in which they lived were small cheaply constructed wooden affairs with a garden at the back. The more comfortable among them kept cows and perhaps a pig, housed in a little shed at the rear of the garden. The street was dimly lighted and in places there was no sidewalk.. The smell of manure in the air awoke something heady in his brain. He turned out of the street and went into a little dark alleyway behind the cows and pigs. For a half hour he stayed in the alleyway, smelling the strong smell of animals too closely housed and letting his mind play with the strange new thoughts that came to him. The smell of the manure awoke something in him that he had not felt in years. He felt that he was in a place that had been a part of some former existence. He was in an alleyway.. The excited young man, unable to bear the weight of his own thoughts, began to move cautiously along the alleyway. The desire to say words overcame him and he said words without meaning, rolling them over on his tongue and saying them because they were brave words, full of meaning. George went into a vacant lot and throwing back his head looked up at the sky. He felt unutterably big and re-made by the simple experience through which he had been passing and in a kind of fervor of emotion put up his hands, thrusting them into the darkness above his head and muttering words. The smoke from the chimneys mounting straight up into the clear air, the grunting of pigs, the women clad in cheap calico dresses and washing dishes in the kitchens, the dogs barking and the children crying.. George Willard walked down the street looking at the houses. He wished he had the courage to call them out of their houses and to shake their hands. ""If there were only a woman here I would take hold of her hand and we would run until we were both tired out,"" he thought. He thought she would understand his mood and that he would achieve in her presence a position he had long been wanting to achieve. When George Willard got to Belle Carpenter's house there had already been a visitor there before him. Ed Handby had come to the door and calling Belle out of the house had tried to talk to her. He had felt like one being used for some obscure purpose and had not enjoyed the feeling. Now he thought he had suddenly become too big to be used. He felt like he had become a man who had no right to be a man..  Belle Carpenter and the young reporter walked about under the trees in the sweet night air. She thought that as she walked through the streets with young Willard, Ed Handby would follow and she wanted to make him suffer. She was made happy by the sight and when George Willard came to the door she greeted him effusively and hurriedly put on her hat. The bartender had come to woo, not to threaten, and was angry with himself because of his failure. He had wanted to ask the woman to come away with him and to be his wife, but when she came and stood by the door he lost his self-assurance and became sullen. ""If I catch you together I will break your bones and his too,"" he added.. George Willard was full of big words. He wanted to make Belle Carpenter realize that he was aware of his former weakness and that he had changed. ""You will find me different,"" he declared, thrusting his hands into his pockets and looking boldly into her eyes. ""I don't know why but it is so. You have got to take me for a man or let me alone. That's how it is."" The pair walked up a hill to the Winesburg Fair Grounds. The hill began at Waterworks Pond and climbed upwards to the fair grounds. On the hillside grew dense bushes and small trees. Among the bushes were little open spaces carpeted with long grass, now stiff and frozen. The grass was the same as the grass that had been on George Willard's shoulders in the alley.. George Willard did not understand what happened to him that night on the hillside. Later, when he got to his own room, he wanted to weep and then grew half insane with anger and hate. He hated Belle Carpenter and was sure that all his life he would continue to hate her. ""Lust,"" he whispered, ""lust and night and women."" ""I am not a man. I am a man,"" he said. ""I have no idea what I am doing. I just want to be with you."" ""You are not a woman. You are a man"" ""I want to know you. I want to talk to you.""""I am a woman,"" she replied. ""What do you want to say to me?"" ""I would like to ask you to tell me what it is that makes you feel so strongly about me."" ""It is. Ed Handby had led Belle Carpenter to a vacant lot by the laborers' houses. The bartender did not want to beat the boy, who he thought had tried to take his woman away. He knew that beating was unnecessary, that he had power within himself to accomplish his purpose without that. ""You're no good,"" he said roughly. ""I've half a mind not to bother with you. I'd let you alone if I didn't want you so much."" ""I'm not going to let you take my woman away,"" he told her. ""If you want me to take her away, you'll have to wait until I'm done with her"" ""I don't want to take your woman away, but I'm going to make sure she doesn't get away from me,"" the bartender said.. George Willard was beaten three times by Ed Handby. Handby took Belle Carpenter by the arm and marched her away. George Willard heard the man and woman making their way through the bushes. He hated himself and he hated the fate that had brought about his humiliation. When his mind went back to the hour alone in the alleyway he was puzzled, and stopping in the darkness, listened, hoping to hear again the voice, outside himself, that had so short a time before put new courage into his heart. He could not bear the sight and began to run, wanting to get quickly out of the neighborhood that now seemed to him utterly squalid and commonplace. When he reached the street of frame houses he could notbear the sight."

The rain beats them brutally down. They are denied a last golden flash across the sky. In October leaves should be carried away, out over the plains, in a wind. They should go dancing away. But instead they are being beaten down by the rain.. The people here call him insane. ""He is a little cracked,"" they say. He lives alone in a little house buried deep in the forest and has a small dog he carries always in his arms. He cannot draw close to people near at hand so he gets hold of a name out of a newspaper and his mind plays with it. On one morning he told me he was a cousin to the man named Cox.. The old man told me that the actress was his sister. He spoke of their childhood together. ""You would not realize it to see us now but we were poor then,"" he said. ""Once when there was a storm, the wind nearly swept our house away"" He is sixty years old and the actress whose story appeared in the newspapers is twenty.. A man in Chicago has murdered his wife and there seems no reason for the deed. The man, who is now on trial in the courts and will no doubt be hanged, worked in a bicycle factory. He loved a girl who worked in the office of the factory where he was employed. To the foreman, a heavy stolid looking man with grey eyes, she seemed the most beautiful woman.. The foreman took the girl from Iowa home with him to his apartment in Thirty-second Street. All day in the shop and during the evening at home he carried her figure about with him in his mind. ""She is a pure, virginal thing,"" he thought vaguely. ""What can she be thinking about as she sits there by the window at work"". The author's wife was like some strange unlovely growth that had attached itself to his body. The mother-in-law was the soul of goodness. She took the place of a servant in the home and got no pay. The little boy of nine awoke and cried. He wanted to sit on the po-po.. The man pretended to read a newspaper. Although he had washed them carefully grease from the bicycle frames left dark stains under the nails. He thought of the girl and of her white quick hands playing over the keys of a typewriter. He felt dirty and uncomfortable. The man and his wife came home and sat in silence for an hour.. She wanted a lover who would come to her with such a look in his eyes. Occasionally, perhaps once in two weeks, she stayed a little late at the office, pretending to have work that must be finished. Through the window she could see the foreman waiting for her. When everyone had gone she closed her desk and went into the street.. She dreamed of the lover who would some time come, a tall fair young man, a rich man owning houses and lands. The workingman who walked beside her had nothing to do with her conception of love. She stayed at the office until the others had gone to walk unobserved with him because of his eyes.. He would lie awake eager, expectant --expecting, what? He sat in the apartment under the electric light pretending to read a newspaper. He looked at his hands. They were large, shapeless, a working-man's hands. With her he went out of the apartment and walked in silence through miles of streets.. A man who worked as foreman in the bicycle factory killed his wife and he is now in the courts being tried for murder. ""Suppose that man who darted into the alleyway had intended to kill us,"" he thought. Opening the knife he whirled about and struck at his wife. He struck twice, a dozen times-- madly madly.. The janitor had neglected to light the gas in the lower hallway. Afterwards, the foreman, decided, that was the reason he did it, that and the fact that the dark slinking figure of a man darted out of an alleyway and then darted back again. ""Surely,"" he told himself, ""I could never have done it had the gas been lighted"". He could not tell how it had happened. ""There was no light. The janitor has neglected to light the gas."" Well--there had been a struggle and in the darkness his wife had been killed. He said he did not know why he killed his wife and was careful to say nothing of the girl at the office.. The man who has killed his wife is being shouted in the pages of the city newspapers that come to our village each morning. ""He is my brother,"" he said over and over, shaking his head. ""You see we played together in a barn back of our father's house,"" he began again. ""We were boys together that man and I,"" he continued again.. ""We have different names, but we are brothers. We played together in a barn back of our father's house. For hours we lay together in the hay in the barn and it was warm there"" ""The spirit of the man who had killed his wife came into the body of the little old man there by the roadside"". The whole story of mankind's loneliness, of the effort to reach out to unattainable beauty tried to get itself expressed from the lips of a mumbling old man, crazed with loneliness. The intensity of the old man's desire was terrible and in sympathy my body began to tremble. His arms tightened about the body of the little dog so that it cried with pain..

He also wrote a play about his father, which he also published. The book, ""Wing Biddlesbaum,"" was published by Simon & Schuster. Wing Biddlebaum, who for twenty years had been the town mystery, lost something of his timidity, and his shadowy personality, submerged in a sea of doubts, came forth to look at the world. With the young reporter at his side, he ventured in the light of day into Main Street or strode up and down on the rickety front porch of his own. The story of Wing Biddlebaum's hands is worth a book in itself. The slender expressive fingers, forever active, came forth and became the piston rods of his machinery of expression. Their restless activity, like unto the beating of the wings of an imprisoned bird, had given him his name. Some obscure poet of the town had thought of it. He wanted to keep them hidden away.. Wing Biddlebaum picked as high as a hundred and forty quarts of strawberries in a day. George Willard had many times wanted to ask about the hands. He felt that there must be a reason for their strange activity and their inclination to keep hidden away. The hands became his distinguishing feature, the source of his fame. Winesburg was proud of the hands of Wing Biddlesbaum in the same spirit in which it was proud.. George Willard was told by Wing Biddlebaum that he was too influenced by the people about him. Biddlebaum then made a picture for Willard of a pastoral golden age. In the picture men came to gather about the feet of an old man who sat beneath a tree in a tiny garden and who talked to them. For once he forgot the hands. Slowly they stole forth and lay upon George Willard's shoulders.. George Willard saw Wing Biddlebaum caress his hands. The old man said, ""You must try to forget all you have learned"" He then hurried down the hillside and across a meadow. George Willard went along the road toward town. ""I'll not ask him about his hands,"" he thought. ""There's something wrong, but I don't want to know what it is"". The hands of Wing Biddlebaum were the influence of a teacher. The teacher was Adolph Myers, a man of gentle power. The hands were fluttering pennants of promise. The poet who discovered the hands will tell the story of their influence. The story of the hands needs a poet. The hand is the story. The words are the words. They are the hands of the teacher.. The tragedy did not linger. Hidden, shadowy doubts that had been in men's minds concerning Adolph Myers were galvanized into beliefs. Trembling lads were jerked out of bed and questioned. In his bed at night he imagined unspeakable things and in the morning he went forth to tell his dreams as facts. Strange, hideous accusations fell from his loose-hung lips.. Adolph Myers was driven from the Pennsylvania town in the night. With lanterns in their hands a dozen men came to the door of the house where he lived alone. They had intended to hang the schoolmaster, but something in his figure, so small, white, and pitiful, touched their hearts and they let him escape.. Adolph Myers lived alone in Winesburg, Ohio, for twenty years. He was but forty but looked sixty- five. He had an aunt in Wineburg, a black-toothed old woman who raised chickens. He lived with her until she died. He worked as a day laborer in the fields.. Wing Biddlebaum was a young man who lived in a small town in the U.S. He wrote about his loneliness and his waiting for the return of a boy he loved. He also wrote of his love for the boy, who was the medium through which he expressed his love of man. The boy died in a car crash in the early hours of the morning. The story was published in the book, ""The. A few stray white bread crumbs lay on the cleanly washed floor by the table. Putting the lamp upon a low stool he began to pick up the crumbs, carrying them to his mouth one by one"

The author was a swipe with a horse called Burt, who was campaigned by his friend Harry Whitehead. The story is told through the eyes of a young man who is now a race horse owner himself. The tale is told from the point of view of a man who has been a swipe for a horse for a year and a half, and has had to deal with his own foolishness. The writer says he feels a kind of satisfaction in making himself look cheap by telling the story. The novel is published by Simon & Schuster, priced £16.99.. I got the place with Harry and I liked Burt fine. We got along splendid together. He was a big nigger with a lazy sprawling body and soft, kind eyes. When it came to a fight he could hit like Jack Johnson. He had Bucephalus, a big black pacing stallion that could do 2 miles. I kept thinking of wagons running over him and bricks falling on his head as he walked along the street. But never mind him. I was too big to mow people’s lawns and sell newspapers. I’ve an idea Mildred thought my taking the place would stand in the way of her getting the job she’d been working so long for. But after all I had to work, and there was no other work to be got.. ""I had a little gelding named Doctor Fritz that never lost a race all fall when Harry wanted him to win,"" he says. ""Such fellows don’t know nothing at all. They’ve never had no opportunity. ...But I did,"" he adds. ""I was a peachy time for me, I’ll say that."" ""It was the best time of my life,"" he writes. ""It's the only time I've ever had a good time in my life."" ""I've never had a better time than when I was a nigger,"" he recalls. ""That's the reason I'm so proud of myself."". Burt taught me how to rub down a horse and put the bandages on after a race and steam a horse out. He could wrap a bandage on a horse’s leg so smooth that if it had been the same color you would think it was his skin. Doctor Fritz would be, say, in the 2. 25 trot on Tuesday afternoon and on Thursday afternoon Bucephalus would knock ‘em cold in the ‘free-for-all’ pace. You got to a county seat town, maybe say on a Saturday or Sunday, and. The story of the two horses is told in the book, ""The Horse and His Wife"" The book is about the life of a horseman, and how he learned to ride. The story is based on a true story, but the story is fictional. The book was written in the 1930s, and the book was published in 1939. It was published by Simon & Schuster, who also wrote the book ""The Book of the Horse and Its Wife"" It is published in the U.S. by Simon&Schuster, Inc., with a copyright of the book’s title, The Horse & His Wife, published in 1937. The first edition of the novel was published with a foreword written by Henry James, who was. ""I promised mother I’d quit the race horses for good. There not being any work in our town any more than when I left there to go to the races, I went off to Sandusky and got a pretty good place taking care of horses for a man who owned a teaming and delivery and storage and coal and real-estate business there"" ""I wasn’t dissatisfied and I could send money home. I wasn't dissatisfied and he could send me money home"" ""And then, as I started to tell you, the fall races come to Sanduskys and I got the day off and I went"" ""Gee whizz. I�’ll split a quart with you. Gee whiz. I. ""I like a man to be a man and dressed up, but not to go put on that kind of airs"" ""I’ve always thought to myself, “Put up a good front” and so I did it"" ""There was a lot of horsemen and strangers and dressed-up people from other towns standing around in the lobby and in the bar"" ""A fellow with a cane and a Windsor tie on, that it made me sick to look at him. So I pushed him aside, kind of rough, and had me a drink of whiskey"" ""He looked at me, as though he thought maybe he’d get gay, but he changed his mind and didn’t say anything"". ""I bought myself the best seat I could get up in the grand stand, but didn't go in for any of these boxes. That’s putting on too many airs. And then I had another whiskey, just to show him something, and went out and had a hack out to the races, all to myself, and when I got there I bought myself a seat"" ""I liked one thing about the same as the other, sitting up there and feeling grand and being down there and looking up at the yaps and feeling grander and more important too. I’ve often said that. One thing's about as good as another, if you take it just right,"" he says.. ""She was the nicest girl I’ve ever seen in my life,"" says the author. ""She wasn’t stuck on herself and she could talk proper grammar without being like a school teacher"" ""I think maybe her father was well-to-do, but not rich to make her chesty because she was his daughter"" ""She was a peach! She had on a soft dress, kind of a blue stuff and it looked carelessly made, but was well sewed and made and everything"" ""There are some of that kind are all right and he was one of the ones"" ""He was the kind maybe that goes to college and then comes to be a lawyer or maybe a newspaper editor"". My grandfather was Welsh and over in the old country, in Wales he was. Maybe he owned a drug store or a drygoods store in their home town. I knew what he was up to, but he didn’t talk big and noisy and let everyone around know he was a sport as some do. He wasn't that kind of man. He was a very quiet man. I never asked him about his family.. The race was at Marietta, Ohio, and the horse was owned by a Mr. Mathers. The horse was a horse Bob French had in his string but Bob didn’t own him. The race was won by a horse called The Count, a horse owned by an Ohio coal miner. The winner was a colt named The Count by the name of The Count. The Count won the race by a distance of 2.5 lengths, finishing in second place behind the favorite, The Count’s brother, The King. The King was a member of the Ohio House of Representatives from the late 1800s to the early 1900s. He was a Presbyterian and his wife may have been a stiffer one than he was.. Bob Mathers was a horse owner in Ohio. He had a horse called About Ben Ahem who was fast as a streak and could go out in front. He was given the horse by a friend of his, a man called Burt, who worked for him. Burt then turned the horse over to Bob, who then raced the horse. The horse won the race, but Burt was not involved in the race. The story was that Burt told his wife that he had sold the horse to a friend. The owner was never found out. The race was never won by the horse, but the story was true, and the horse was never raced again.. The story is based on an incident that happened on the farm of Mr. Mathers, a black man who worked on the team at the time. The story is about a horse called About Ben Ahem, a horse that was owned by Mr. Mathers' son-in-law, Harry Mather. The horse was a racehorse, and the story was about a bottle of wine that was drunk by a nigger. The nigger drank the whole bottle and then let Burt drive the horse, who was a driver, around the track. The race was over and the horse was put back in the barn, and Burt had to get it back on the track again.. The author was at the fair with his wife and two daughters. He decided to give them a gift. He says he was surprised by their kindness. The gift was a book of photos of the girls. The book is called ""The Girl Who Lived"" and is published by Simon & Schuster, $16.99.

""I suppose it was their having such swell names that got me off my trolley"" ""I was glad I had those twenty-five cent cigars in my pocket and right away I give that fellow one and lit one myself"" ""A fellow, just because he has been a swipe with a race horse and works taking care of horses for a man in the teaming, delivery, and storage business, isn’t any better or worse than anyone else. I’ve often thought that, and said it too"" ""But you know how a fellow is"". I made a fool of myself, that’s what I did. I said my name was Walter Mathers from Marietta, Ohio, and then I told all three of them the smashingest lie you ever heard. What I said was that my father owned the horse About Ben Ahem and that he had let him out to this Bob French for racing purposes, because our family was proud and had never gone into racing that way, in our own name, I mean. Miss Lucy Wessen's eyes were shining, and I went the whole hog. I couldn’t show her up for a boob, could I? I told about our place down at Marietna, and about the big stables. ""I acted just as reluctant to tell as I could. What I did was to start things and then let them drag the rest out of me"" ""I said he would lose the first heat by pacing like a lame cow and then he would come back and skin ‘em alive after that."" ""I took thirty dollars out of my pocket and handed it to Mr. Wilbur Wessen and asked him, would he mind, after the first Heat, to go down and place it on About Ben Ahem for whatever odds he could get"" ""My father had been expecting maybe this Bob French wasn’t on the square, and had sent me up to Sandusky on the sly to find out what I could"" ""We’ve always been pretty poor, but not asking anything of anyone at that, and my grandfather,. Wilbur Wessen went down to the betting place under the grand stand and there I was with the two girls, and when that Miss Woodbury was looking the other way once, Lucy Wessen kinda, with her shoulder you know, kinda touched me. Not just tucking down, I don’t mean. You know how a woman can do. They get close, but not getting gay either. Gee whizz. What I said was that I didn't want Bob French to see me and none of the swipes. And then they give me a jolt. What they had done, when I didn’tsh, was to get together, and they had decided. Ahem stepped the next three heats like a bushel of spoiled eggs going to market before they could be found out, and Wilbur Wessen had got nine to two for the money. I was sick then, but I was Sicker later. There ain't any Walter Mathers, like I said to her and them, and there hasn't ever been one, but if there was, I bet I’d go to Marietta, Ohio, and shoot him tomorrow. I bet there’s never been one of those. There hasn’t been one. There’ll never be one of them.. ""There’s a kind of girl you see just once in your life, and if you don’t get busy and make hay, then you’re gone for good and all, and might as well go off a bridge"" ""You want that girl to be your wife, and you want nice things around her like flowers and swell clothes,"" he says. ""There's a way you know ... Craps amighty"" ""There�'s a thing you know about a girl that you can’'t get away from,"" he adds. ""You can't just get away with it. You have to make it happen."" ""I’m not saying much, and she wasn’n't saying much. The author recalls a night out with Wilbur and Lucy Woodbury in Sandusky, Ohio. The pair went to Cedar Point in a launch, but Wilbur blew himself out on the way home. He says he would not have known if he hadn't listened to his wife's advice. Gee whizz, he says, what a story that would have been.. The author's mother made him learn to eat with a fork at the table, and not swill soup. He recalls how he and his sister Lucy sat in a dark place on a beach in the middle of the night. He says his mother made them learn not to be noisy and rough like a gang of common kind of cattle at all. He also recalls how his father was not a tin horn kind of a sport, but a sporty kind of man. The author's father was a sailor, and he says he never saw his father play a game of football. He said he was a good sportsman, but his father wasn't a sport.. ""I most cried and I most swore and I was so mad and happy and sad,"" she writes. ""Sometimes I hope I have cancer and die,"" she adds. ""I was so happy and I wanted to keep it."" ""I wanted to be a part of it,"" she says, ""but I couldn't be."" ""It was like I was in a dream. I was like a kid in a movie,"" she recalls. ""It's like you can't get out of it"" ""I'm so glad I'm not a kid anymore,"" the writer says. ""You can't be a kid if you're not happy and you want to keep going."" ""You're not a child if you don't want to be,"" she replies. ""That's what. She whispered and said it was like she and I could get out of the boat and walk on the water, and it sounded foolish, but I knew what she meant. “It won’t be long because you’ll write and I’'ll write to you,” she said. ‘I got a chance like a hay barn afire. A swell chance I got.’ ‘And me trying to pass myself off for a big-bug and a swell—to her, as decent a little body as God ever made’‘And maybe she would write me, down at Marietta that way,. ""I could have run after that train and made Dan Patch look like a freight train after a wreck but, socks amighty, what was the use? Did you ever see such a fool?"" ""I’ll bet you what—if I had an arm broke right now or a train had run over my foot—I wouldn’t go to no doctor at all,"" he said.. I’d go set down and let her hurt and hurt—that’s what I’'d do. I don’t care nothing for working, and earning money, and saving it for no such boob as myself. Gosh darn his eyes, he’m a big fool—that's what he is. If I'm not another you just go find me one and I'll quit working and be a bum."

Bildad wheedles the stable men and the trainers from the horse farms in our country around Lexington. He is always doing little favors and telling about things to eat, chicken browned in a pan, and how is the best way to cook sweet potatoes and corn bread. BildAd gets in with the trainers and does little favors for them. A nigger from our country can flatter and wheedle anyone into letting him do most anything he wants. He can get into a poker game with them. He's a very good cook. He likes the horses. In the spring Bildad begins to scratch around. He works at Ed Becker's livery barn in our home town, Beckersville.. Bildad is a former jockey and now works as a cook for a racing outfit. He says the horses are all the talk in Beckersville during the racing season. ""I wish I was a nigger. It's a foolish thing to say, but that's the way I am about being around horses, just crazy. I can't help it. It makes your mouth water to hear him. It just makes you want to go and see him,"" he says. ""He's a great cook. He's a real pleasure to work with. I love him to bits. I'm so proud of him. He is a great guy. He makes me feel so proud."" ""I'm so glad he's here. I've missed him so much. I just want to see him. I want him to. Four boys from Beckersville, Kentucky, made up their minds to go to the races. The boys, aged 15 to 20, worked nights and Saturdays in a grocery store. They made enough money to pay for a trip to Niagara Falls. The men cut out when the race was over, but the boys kept going to the race. They won the race, and the boys went on to the next one in New York City, the next day in New Jersey. The four boys made it to the final race, which was held in Buffalo, New York, and they won the gold medal for the mile-and-a-half race. The race was held at Niagara Falls, which is now the site of the world's largest open-air museum.. We bought things there, souvenirs and spoons and cards and shells with pictures of the falls on them for our sisters and mothers, but thought we had better not send any of the things home. We didn't want to put the folks on our trail and maybe be nabbed. Niggers are all right about things like that. They won't squeal on you. White men will do that, but not a nigger. You can trust them. They are squarer with kids. I don't know why. I didn't know they were professional gamblers. Henry Rieback's father is one too. Dave Williams and Arthur Mulford and Jerry Myers and others. Then there was a lot from Louisville and Lexington Henry RIEback knew but I didn’t. They were professionalgamblers. My own father is a lawyer. He's all right, but don't make much money and can't buy me things. He never said nothing to me against Henry, but Hanley Turner and Tom Tumberton's fathers did. They said to their boys that money so come by is no good and they didn't want their boys brought up to hear gamblers' talk and be thinking about such things and maybe embrace them. That's what I'm writing this story about. I'm getting to be a man and want to think straight and be O. I don't see what it's got to do with Henry or with horses either. I am puzzled. I want to know what's going on with him.. Harry Hellinfinger in Beckersville, whose father is Postmaster, is grown up and too lazy to work. He likes to stand around in the street and get up jokes on boys like sending them to a hardware store for a gimlet to bore square holes and other jokes like that. He told me that if I would eat a half a cigar I would be stunted and not grow any more and maybe could be a rider. When father wasn't looking I took a cigar out of his pocket and gagged it down some way. It made me awful sick and the doctor had to be sent for, and then it did no good. I kept right on growing. It was a joke. When I told what I had done and why most fathers would have whipped me but mine didn't.. Harry Hellinfinger grew up in Beckersville, North Carolina. He says he would like to be a stable boy, but his father wouldn't let him. Instead, he walked to the tracks to watch the horses race. He now works for a racing agency in New York. He is married to the former Miss North Carolina, who he met at the track. He also has a son and a daughter, both of whom are now in their 20s and 30s, and a son-in-law, who is also a racing agent. He has also worked for the New York Racing Association, which he says has helped him get to the top.. Every morning on a big track owned by a rich man who lives maybe in New York, there are always, nearly every morning, a few colts and some of the old race horses and geldings and mares that are cut loose. A white man can't do it and some niggers can't but a track nigger can every time. It's in my blood like in the blood of race track niggers and trainers. Even when they just go slop-jogging along with a little nigger on their backs I can tell a winner. If my throat hurts and it's hard for me to swallow, that's him. He'll run like Sam Hill when you let him out. I don't mean all horses but some.. ""If I wanted to be a gambler like Henry Rieback's father I could get rich. I know I could and Henry says so too"" ""You hunch down on top of the fence and itch inside you. Over in the sheds the niggers giggle and sing"" ""If he don't win every time it'll be a wonder"" ""It's lovely to be there. You hunker down ontop of the fences and itch."" ""You don't see a horse, the kind I've been talking about, very often, but it's nice anyway"" ""What would he be there for and not pulling a plow? If he couldn't what would hebe there for?"". The writer was in Saratoga for six days with his family and friends. They stayed in the grandstands and paddocks and ate with the horses. The men from home stayed in grandstand and betting field and didn't come out around the places where the horses are kept. He says: ""I told everything we done except one thing. I did and saw that alone. That's what I'm writing about. I think about it at night. It got me upset"" He adds: ""Nothing smells better than coffee and manure and horses and niggers and bacon frying and pipes being smoked out of doors on a morning like that. It just gets you, that's what it does. Here it is. It's what we did."". At Saratoga they don't have paddocks under an open shed as at Lexington and Churchill Downs. The horses are sweaty and nervous and shine. The men come out and smoke cigars and look at them. Your heart thumps so you can hardly breathe. The boys that ride come running out with their silk clothes on and you run to get a place by the fence with the niggers. The other boys didn't but I did. I always am wanting to be a trainer or owner, and at the risk of being seen and caught and sent home I went to the paddocks before every race. I did not want to be sent home, I wanted to be the best trainer in the world.. Middlestride is long and looks awkward and is a gelding. Sunstreak is like a girl you think about sometimes but never see. When you look at his head you want to kiss him. He is a stallion and nervous and belongs on the biggest farm we've got in our country, the Van Riddle place. There isn't anything as sweet as that horse. He's trained by Jerry Tillford who knows me and has been good to me lots of times, lets me walk into a horse's stall to look at him close and other things. He goes away slow and is always way back at the half, then he begins to run and if the race is a mile and a quarter he'll just eat up everything and get there.. Sunstreak is a bird dog. He just lays down and runs like a bird. There can't anything I ever see run like him except Middlestride when he gets untracked and stretches himself. I ached to see that race and those two horses run, ached and dreaded it too. I didn't want to see either of our horses beaten. We had never sent a pair like that to the races before. Old men in Beckersville said so and the niggers said so. It was a fact. It makes you ache to see him. I forgot all about being seen myself and walked right up. No one noticed me except Jerry Tillford who saw me and something happened.. ""I could just in a way see right inside him. He was going to do some awful running and I knew it,"" he says. ""I looked up and then that man and I looked into each other's eyes. I guess I loved the man as much as I did the horse"" ""I cried and Jerry Tillford had a shine in his eyes,"" he adds. ""There wasn't anything in the world but that man, the horse and me"" ""He was like the water in the river at Niagara Falls just before its goes plunk down,"" says the jockey. ""That horse wasn't thinking about running. He don't have to think about that. I'll tell you about that later."" ""I was standing looking at that horse and aching. In some way, I can't tell how, I knew just how Sunstreak felt inside,"" he. Sunstreak ran first of course and he busted the world's record for a mile. Everything came out just as I expected. Middlestride got left at the post and was way back and closed up to be second. He'll get a world's Record too some day. They can't skin the Beckersville country on horses. I've seen that if I never see anything more. The horse was better than me, more steadier, and now I know better than Jerry. He was the quietest and he had to do the running. I liked him that afternoon even more than I ever liked my own father. I almost forgot the horses thinking that way about him.. The race was held at a track near the end of a long stretch of road. The track is made of asphalt, but there are trees and grass around it. The race was won by a horse named ""Sandy"" who was a favorite of the team. The team's other star, ""Sally"" won the race and was awarded a gold medal for her performance. The other horse, ""Bubba,"" won the silver medal for his performance in the race. The horse was named after the first horse to win the race, which was named ""Buddy"" in the late 1800s. It was the first time the team had been together since the first race in 1881. The next day, the team went to the track again and won the gold medal.. ""I wanted to be as near Jerry as I could. I felt close to him"" ""The women in the house were all ugly mean-looking women"" ""It's what give me the fantods. I can't make it out"" ""I was just lonesome to see Jerry, like wanting to see your father at night when you are a young kid"" ""They were all drunk and the rummy looking farm house was a place for bad women to stay in""""I crept up along a fence and looked through a window and saw. a woman in a rummy farm house."" ""It was the direction they went in. It was the way they went"". The women had on loose dresses and sat around in chairs. The men came in and some sat on the women's laps. The place smelled rotten and there was rotten talk. A nigger wouldn't go into such a place. Jerry bragged in that bad woman house as I know Sunstreak wouldn't never have bragged. He lied and bragged like a fool. He said that he made that horse, that it was him that won the race and made the record. I've told you how I had been feeling about him on account of his knowing what was going on inside of Sunstreaks. He was a liar and a cheat. He made a world's record. He didn't know what he was talking about.. ""I wished I hadn't gone away from the tracks, but had stayed with the boys and the niggers and the horses,"" he says. ""I wanted to scream and rush in the room and kill him,"" he adds. ""Then, all of a sudden, I began to hate that man."" ""I never had such a feeling before,"" he writes. ""The tall rotten looking woman was between us just as Sunstreak was in the paddocks in the afternoon"" ""I was so angry, I wanted to kill that man,"" he. ""I was so mad clean through that I cried and my fists were doubled up so my finger nails cut my hands"" ""I've been thinking about it ever since. I can't make it out. Spring has come again and I'm nearly sixteen and go to the tracks mornings same as always, and I see Sunstreak and Middlestride and a new colt named Strident"" ""No one thinks so but me and two or three niggers. At the tracks the air don't taste as good or smell as good. It's because a man like Jerry Tillford, who knows what he does, could see a horse like SunStreak run, and kiss a woman like that the same day. I. ""I keep thinking about it and it spoils looking at horses and smelling things and hearing niggers laugh and everything. Sometimes I'm so mad about it I want to fight someone,"" he said. ""What did"

A young man from a neighboring field came stealthily across a field and climbed a fence. He also came to the hill but for a time did not see her lying almost at his feet. He looked toward the house and stood with hands in pockets, stamping on the frozen ground like a horse. The aroma of her crept into his consciousness. He ran to kneel beside her silent figure. Everything was different than it had been when they crept to the field on the other evenings. The wind rustled the dry leaves of a walnut tree that grew on top of the hill. Below the hill there was a swamp in which cattails grew. It took a long time for the wagon to pass. The little noises ran along the ground to where she was lying on the grass.. He plowed her deeply. She carried the seeds of a son within herself. He grew bold and put his hands on her face, her neck, her breasts, her hips. There was a strange new firmness and hardness to her body. When he kissed her lips she did not move and for a moment he was afraid. Then courage came and he went down to lie with her. She was large and strong. Her legs went swinging along. Her arms went around him. He became sure of himself. He planted the seeds in the warm rich quivering soil. He had been a farm boy all his life and had plowed many acres of rich black land. He was a farmer.. A thousand children were buried in the barren field. They struggled to come out of the ground. For a long time she stayed in the field, shaken with sorrow. The voices of the darkness cried to her as she went along a lane and past a silent barn.Within herself only the one child struggled. The son within her went swinging along. The brook ran over stones and its voice cried out. For more information on the book, visit: http://www.thebookshop.com/bookshop/the-book-shop/ The-Book-Shop/The- Book-Shop-The-Book.html.

When she got into bed his heels beat upon the walls of his prison. She lay still and listened. Only one small voice seemed coming to her out"

""I came here because I am tired,"" he said dejectedly. ""My body is not tired but something inside me is old and worn-out. I want joy"" He was a small man with a beard and was very nervous. I remember how the cords of his neck were drawn taut. He jumped up from the steps where we had been sitting, talking and walked about. The doctor became shrill. It is at such times that a man boasts, uses big words, makes a fool of himself in general. He bursts into words and talks, perhaps foolishly. Little side currents of his nature he didn't know were there run out and get themselves expressed. He is a man of words and a man who speaks with his heart and soul.. ""I don't want to swim or do any damn plodding thing. I want to run and shout,"" he declared. ""I have one desire and one only--to free myself"" ""Love must be the beginning of things with me,"" he said. ""It is the only way I can get at things. I have to try to love"" ""I want to be like a dead leaf blown by the winds over these hills,"" he added. ""For awhile, for a few hours, I want, to be, like, a dead Leaf"" ""You are right there. I've done that,"" he replied. ""Yes--you are right. I'm sorry."" ""I'm sorry,"" he repeated.. ""You are no more and no better than myself,"" I declared. ""You are a dog that has rolled in offal, and because you are not quite a dog you do not like the smell of your own hide"" ""You think you understand, but you don't understand,"" he cried. ""The thing you want to do cannot be done. Fool--do you expect love to be understood?"" ""Men like you are fools. You cannot go along that road. It is given to no man to venture far along the road of lives"" ""How smart we are--how aptly we put things!"" ""How well we understand each other!"" ""We are not the same people!"" ""I am not the only man who has ever been to hell and back."" ""I have been to heaven and back, and I have been there many times."". A woman from Iowa came here to Chicago and took a room in a house on the west-side. She was about twenty-seven years old and ostensibly she came to the city to study advanced methods for teaching music. ""I am weary and want to be made clean. I am covered by creeping crawling things,"" she said. ""And that's why I want to run and play,"" she added. 'I want to die and be born again, and I am only a tree covered with vines and slowly dying' 'What you say can't be done can be done. You're a liar,' she replied. 'And I am an amateur venturing timidly into lives' 'I am a leaf blown by the wind over hills,' she said, 'and I am a tree that is slowly dying.' 'I'm a leaf that's slowly dying,' she added. The woman from Iowa lived in the west-side house and came home from the city in the evening. She looked like a thousand other women one sees in the streets every day. The only thing that at all made her stand out among the women in the crowds was that she was a little lame. Her right foot was slightly deformed and she walked with a limp. When they met in the hallway at the front of the house they stopped, laughed and whispered. ""She wants a lover,"" they said and winked. ""I have often wished he would decide to become a writer. He tells things with understanding and he does not paint brilliantly,"" says the author. ""There is something very sweet in his nature,"" adds the author of the novel. ""He is a painter but I have often wanted him to be a writer,"" says author.. ""Whenever a man approached her she became alarmed,"" he said. Men kept smiling and speaking to her. They invited her to dinner and to the theatre, but nothing would induce her to walk in the streets with a man. She never went into the streets at night. When a man stopped and tried to talk with her in the hallway she turned her eyes to the floor and then ran into her room. Once a young drygoods clerk who lived there induced her to sit with him on the steps before the house. When she began to cry he was alarmed and arose. He tried to explain, but under the touch of his fingers her whole body shook with terror. She may not know it but a lover is what she needs,"" said the man's friend, LeRoy. ""There would be no story were the matter that simple"". LeRoy has spoken to me of the experience of the Iowa woman in the west-side house. The men there began to hate her. Although she would have nothing to do with them she would not let them alone. In a hundred ways she continually invited approaches that when made she repelled. When she stood naked in the bathroom facing the hallway where the men passed up and down she left the door slightly ajar. There was a couch in the living room down stairs, and when men were present she would sometimes enter and without saying a word throw herself down before them. Her eyes stared at the ceiling. Her whole physical being seemed to be waiting for something. The sense of her filled the room. She began to scream and people passing in the street stopped to listen. The drygoods clerk was alarmed and ran upstairs to his own room. He bolted the door and stood listening. ""It is a trick,"" he declared in a trembling voice. ""She is trying to make trouble. I did nothing to her. The painter is tall and lean and his life has been spent in devotion to ideas. His income is small and he has not married. Perhaps he has never had a sweetheart. He is not without physical desire but he is not primarily concerned with desire. The woman did not knock but opened the door. She said nothing but ran across the floor and knelt at his feet. She was ordered to leave the west-side house. The landlady's voice rang through the house. She stood in the hallway before the Iowa woman's room. They talked loudly. Embarrassment took possession of them and one by one they crept quietly away. They were embarrassed. They had been caught. They felt embarrassed and they were ashamed. They left. They knew they had done nothing wrong. They could not.. ""Take me,"" she said, putting her face down upon his knees and trembling violently. LeRoy said that her twisted foot made her run like a wounded bird. ""Now behave yourself,"" he said quickly. ""I will keep my promise."" He turned to the landlady and smiled. ""We have been engaged to be married,"" he told her. She came here to be near me. She has been unwell and excited. I will take her away. Please don't let yourself be annoyed"" ""I can't stand the waiting. You must take me at once."" ""I am not a man who can be easily led,"" she replied. ""You are not a woman who can easily be led."" ""You can't be a man if you are not used to being led,"" he replied, ""and I am used to leading."" ""There must be a beginning to things,"" she added. ""Take me quickly. There must be the beginning to. LeRoy found a room for her in another house and then went with her into a park and sat on a bench. She was one of four sisters, all engaged in the same sort of work and, LeRoy says, all quiet capable women. Their father had died when the eldest girl was not yet ten, and five years later the mother died also. The girls had a house and a garden. They talked only of women's affairs. Nothing came of it. She went back, I suppose, to her place in the West. The woman had been a teacher of music. LeRoy said he saw and talked with her many times later. He said: ""I will take her away."" The woman said she would not leave him alone. The man said he would take her to his home. The two women went home together. The girl said she was going back to her home in the west.. LeRoy says his wife was affected by the women's lives. He says she wanted desperately to be loved by a man. LeRoy says she had thought too much and acted too little. ""What she wanted she could not achieve,"" he says. ""The living force within could not find expression"" He says the life force within her became decentralized. ""Sex spread itself out over her body. It permeated the very fibre of her being. At the last she was sex personified,"" he writes. ""At the last sex become condensed and impersonal"" ""The life force inside her became decentralised,"" he declares. ""When it could not get expressed in one way it took another"" ""She went to Chicago with that hope in mind. No one of them ever had a lover. For years no man came near the house"". The figure of the woman kept coming into my mind. An idea came to me. ""You might have been her lover,"" I said. ""That was possible. She was not afraid of you."" LeRoy stopped. He laughed and said quietly and softly, ""It isn't so simple"" ""How smart we are. How aptly we put things,"" he said. The suggestion of a sneer played about the corners of his mouth. ""How aptly we have put things."" ""How well we know how to do things"" ""We are not so different from each other,"" he added. ""We have different ways of looking at things"" 'We are the same person. We are not the same people."" 'We have the same way of thinking. We have different ideas of how to look at things' 'We need to change our ways of thinking'. LeRoy: ""She needed a lover, yes, the men in the house were quite right about that"" ""She was a grotesque as many trees in the forest are grotesques,"" he says. ""What would cure her would cure the rest of us also"" ""We all need to be loved,"" LeRoy says, ""and she needed to be long and quietly and patiently loved"" ""I was quite sure. I thought I would be her lover and settle the matter,"" he adds. ""Nothing in life can be settled so definitely"" ""You miss the whole point. By being sure of yourself you are in danger of losing all of the romance of life,"" he writes. ""You lose the romance."" ""I am not a man of words. I am a woman of words,"" he concludes. ""I have no idea what to say to you. You are not a person of words."". LeRoy's voice dropped and he walked beside me in silence. ""I have seen under the shell of life and I am afraid,"" he mused. ""The disease she had is, you see, universal. We all want to be loved and the world has no plan for creating our lovers"" ""I would like to be a dead dry thing,"" he muttered looking at the leaves scattered over the grass. 'I am not subtle or patient enough. I am paying old debts' ""I am a man covered by creeping crawling things,"" he said. 'Old thoughts and beliefs--seeds planted by dead men--spring up in my soul and choke me' 'I would likes to be an old leaf blown away by the wind' 'The world has a plan for us to be lovers, but we don't know how to get there' 'We are not the only ones who want to love, we are the ones who need to love'. ""I would like to be dead and blown by the wind over limitless waters,"" he said. ""I want"

The old man became self-conscious. He put his hand on the stranger's arm and laughed. ""I cure them all--coughs, colds, consumption and the sickness that ble. ""My father was a hard man,"" he declared. ""He was like me, a blacksmith by trade, but he wore a plug hat"" ""My marriage cost me twenty-one dollars--I worked in the corn--it rained and the horses were blind"" ""I married against his will.

""My brother is a bad man -- he is pretty and has pompadour hair, but he would kill and kill. I am ashamed that I am old,"" the old man said.

0.73,0.83,63.30043607987147,"Hugh Walker was in a drugged, silent state after his marriage to Winifred Walker. He taught mathematics in a college in Union Valley, Illinois, and waited for his wife. After his marriage five or six years passed like shadows of wind blown trees playing on a wall. ""I want answering,"" the question seemed to say, ""Stop fooling along. Give your attention to me."" ""Well, I'm married. I have children,"" he muttered. He went home to his own house. He didn't understand. It might have been better had he understood, then he might at least have found himself. ""When a man is put behind iron bars he is in prison. Marriage was marriage to her"". Hugh's house was large and comfortably furnished. He could see through the glass in the door into the room where his family was gathered. One of the women was in the habit of crooning low soft negro songs. Hugh fell under the spell. The voice carried him far away somewhere, into forests, along the edges of swamps. He waited in silence. There was nothing very definite about his thinking. He would have given a good deal to be able to be definite. He went inside the house. ""Well, here I am,"" his mind seemed to say, ""here I am. This is my house, these are my children."" He looked at his wife Winifred. She had grown a little plump since their marriage.. Hugh and Winifred had a fragmentary conversation. ""Perhaps it is the mother in her coming out, she has had three children,"" he thought. The house was an old one and had green shutters. They were continually coming loose and at night blew back and forth on their hinges making a loud banging noise. Hugh made some remark. He said he would see a carpenter about the shutters and went to a neighbor's house. He was not broken at all after the children went to bed. He thought he was better than he had been. He had been better than his wife had thought. He felt better than she had thought he had felt. His wife never broke it as the children did.. Hugh's mind played all about the figure of his wife but did not really approach the woman who sat before him. ""I am a house and my shutters are loose,"" his mind said. He thought of himself as a living thing inside a shell, trying to break out. To avoid distracting conversation he got a book and pretended to read. When his wife had also begun to read he watched her closely, intently. She had a little habit with her hands. When she became lost in the pages of a book the hand crept up to her cheek, touched it and then was put down again. Since her marriage and the coming of the children she had not taken good care of her body. She was one whose race had been run. She became bag-like.. Hugh felt an understanding existed between himself and the negress. He could look at her as at a tree. He was quite sure there was a third person there and that the third person was within himself, inside his body. Hugh was determined to get his life cleaned up if he could manage it. He addressed the third people. He said, as though speaking aloud, ""Well, there is this woman, this person I married, she has the air of something accomplished"" He said this as if speaking aloud. Hugh said this to Winifred. He thought there was an odd, soft light in her old eyes. ""I understand you, my son,"" her eyes seemed to say. Hugh thought this was a strange, soft, light.. The author was walking through a country of low hills when he noticed his wife was getting a little bag-like. ""That may be it,"" he went on. ""She has had these children. They are accomplished facts to her. They came out of her body, not out of mine. Her body has done something. Now it rests."" He looked quickly and sharply at his wife. ""If she is becoming a littlebag-like, that's all right."" He got up and making some trivial excuse got out of the room and out ofThe author's wife continued reading, lost in her book. The reality of life was in some queer way re-established in his mind. Some little thing happened. The real world was re- established in some strange way. He was able to walk and sleep.. Hugh saw a woman carrying a milk pail. She was going to a barn to milk a cow. He had a queer sensation of her having been lifted by an unseen hand and brought to him. The man in the road who had thrown the stone at the farm dog had turned and seen Hugh. He was a middle-aged man, but quite suddenly and unexpectedly he looked like a boy. The woman was dressed in white and he could see her but dimly against the blackish green of the trees of an orchard behind her. Still she stood looking and seemed to look directly into his eyes. He could not see her figure distinctly. The sun had gone down, but a faint glow lit the western horizon. The farm woman was dimly seen going toward a distant barn.. Hugh was distraught and puzzled after the incident. It seemed to him he knew all about her life, all about the life of the man who had thrown the stone at the dog. ""Well, I can't walk for days and days as I did once,"" he thought. ""There are certain facts in life and I must face facts. I must live by them and with them. It's the way lives are lived"" He was an athletic looking man and wore loose fitting clothes. He was a man of few words but a man with a lot of sense. He had a great sense of humor. He could not understand why the dog had attacked him. He thought he had been attacked by a dog.. Hugh felt like a man capable of taking a man's place in life and in another way he didn't at all. He made his mind attend to little things in the effort to forget distances. One night he got out of the road and walked completely around a cornfield. He counted the stalks in each hill of corn and computed the number of stalks. ""It should yield twelve hundred bushels of corn, that field,"" he said to himself dumbly, as though it mattered to him. ""Everything goes on and on but I stand still,"" he thought. ""For what? The old question, always coming back, always wanting answering as a little animal wants food"" Hugh gave up trying to answer. He walked rapidly, trying to grow physically tired.. Hugh felt suddenly old. He pulled a little handful of cornsilk out of the top of an ear of corn and played with it. ""I'd be quite a fellow with a trim yellow moustache,"" he thought. He asked the merchant's son to stay for a moment and, when the two were alone together in the room, he grew suddenly and furiously angry. ""Young man,"" he said, ""you do not come into this room to write on the back of a book and waste your time"" He was furious. The boy was a Union Valley merchant and his father was a schoolmaster. Hugh felt he had lost his way. He was angry. He felt he was losing his way and he was angry with the boy.. Hugh Walker was a professor at Union Valley College in Illinois. He took a student home to his house. The girl's name was Mary Cochran and she had come to the school a few months before. Hugh knew nothing of her except that her father was dead, her mother too, perhaps. A new life began in Hugh Walker's house. Back to Mail Online home. Back To the page you came from..

The girl and her family were often seen together in the winter months. She would often go sledding with the children. The children were delighted to see her and she would often join them. She was a constant presence in their lives. She became a part of the family. She had a special bond with them and they were inseparable. The family was inseparable and she became part of them. The pair were close and had a bond that lasted for years. She died in the summer of 2009. She is buried in a cemetery near her home in the town of Walsall, near the village of Stony Point. She will be remembered for her contribution to the community and for her love of sledding and the children's love of the snow.. Hugh MacIntosh was a teacher in Union Valley, California, in the 1950s. He was devastated by the death of his wife, Winifred. He thought about Mary Cochran, a girl from a country town. He wondered what went on in her mind as she sat in his class-room, as she walked beside him along the streets of Union Valley. Macintosh: ""I could go to her now, touch her fingers, look at her and then go away and never see her again"" He says she was like millions of American girls: ""She is one of the world of people with whom I live and with which I am supposed to work here"" He adds: ""Unlike these children she does not belong to me"" and that was a comfort to him.. Hugh thought of Winifred as a young tree that has not borne fruit. He locked the door to his room and did not want her to come to the door and disturb his thoughts. She read novels and stood talking by his door. He also went to sit on the couch and she put up her hand and touched his face. New life came into her figure and she became more attractive. Hugh did not know what to do. He did not like to think of her as anything or nothing. He went away to his own room and sat for a long time in the darkness. The tall straight figure of the girl, dimly seen, moved quickly about. ""Well, nothing has happened to her. She may be anything orNothing,"" he thought. ""Her figure is like aYoung tree that hasn't borne fruit"". He thought about Mary Cochran, the school girl, but was sure he thought about her in a quite impersonal way. She was like the woman going to milk cows he had seen across hills when he was a young fellow and walked far and wide over the country to cure the restlessness in himself. ""People are like that. They just grow up suddenly out of childhood. It will happen to my own children,"" he told himself. For some reason I have drawn away from life and she has brought me back, he said. He stood within the room for a moment and then unlocked the door and went to the head of the stairs. ""Be quiet when you come up, Winifred. I have a headache and am going to try to sleep,"" he lied.. Mary Cochran was in her third year in the college at Union Valley. She had become almost a fixture in the Walker household. Still she did not know Hugh. She knew the children better than he did, perhaps better than their mother. In the fall she and the two boys went to the woods to gather nuts. She was a great help to Hugh and Winifred, but she was also a burden to him. She did not belong to me. She will go away out of my sight. No doubt she will, after a while make a prison of her own and live in it, but I will have nothing to do with the matter.. Hugh Cochran's silence lasted all through his married life. He stopped to speak to men on the street. When he went to putter about in the garden he whistled and sang. One afternoon in the fall he came home and found the whole family assembled in the living room of the house. The children were playing on the floor and the negress sat in the chair by the window with his youngest child in her arms, crooning one of the negro songs. Hugh walked directly toward her and looked over her shoulder. He reached forward and snatched the book out of the girl's hands. With an oath he threw it into the fire that burned in an open grate at the side of the room. He then walked off and never came back. He was never seen again.. Hugh was miserable. A flood of words ran from him. He cursed books and people and schools. He looked at the startled girl in the chair who also had tears in her eyes. His fingers pulled nervously at his coat. To the two women he looked like a boy who had been caught stealing food in a pantry. ""I am having one of my silly irritable spells,"" he said, looking at his wife but in reality addressing the girl. ""You see I am more serious than I pretend to be. I was not irritated by your book but by something else"" The old negro woman got up and went quickly away. The two older children began to cry.. Hugh Cochran's wife and two children were left alone in the house. He went upstairs to his own room wondering why he had lied to the two women. The old desire to run away from life, to wear himself out physically, came back upon him like a madness. Hugh ate his dinner in silence and went for a long walk. For two weeks Mary Cochran did not come to his house and then one day he saw her on the college grounds. ""Please do not desert us because of my rudeness,"" he said. She blushed and said nothing. He could hear his wife's voice speaking softly and presently the back door of the house banged and he knew the schoolgirl had gone away. Nothing happened. Hugh went home.. Hugh Walker's marriage to Mary Cochran came to an end. Cochran visited the Walker family while Hugh was in his room. She was reading a book in the family room. Hugh thought: ""She isn't like a young tree any more. She is almost like a person who belongs here"" The couple had two children together, and Hugh was a widower. The couple have since divorced and Hugh has remarried, but the marriage has not ended. They have a son, who was born in 2008. The family have three other children, all of whom are now grown up and living in the U.S. The children are now living with their grandparents in New York. The Walker family have a house in the town of Waltham, Massachusetts, which they bought in 2009.. Hugh's oldest boy, now a lad of nine, had been overtaken with a hunger to kiss Hugh's oldest girl. Hugh took hold of her hand and led her down the stairs to his own room. He held the girl against his body and kissed her upon the cheeks and lips. When he led her to the door she was so weak with fright and with new, strange, trembling desires that she could with difficulty make her way down the stair and into his wife's presence. ""She will lie now,"" he thought, and heard her voice coming up the stairs like an echo to his thoughts. ""I have a terrible headache,"" he said. ""You can't understand now what's going to happen here but some day you will"" ""I'm going to kiss you,"" he whispered, ""and then I'mGoing to ask you to go out of this house and. ""She is no longer like a young tree,"" he thought. ""She will be imprisoned but I will have nothing to do with it,"" he said. ""My hands will never build a prison for her,"" he added with grim pleasure. ""I must hurry home,"" he heard her voice saying. The voice was dull and heavy. It was not the voice of a young girl."

There is a woman standing with her back to a wall, in half darkness by a window. Everything I will ever know is distilled in it. The story is almost forgotten but sometimes I remember. The three men are waiting.. The woman upstairs craved love. That must have been the story. She hungered for love with her whole being. She wanted to create in love. When the white silent man came into her presence she sprang forward. Her lips were parted. There was a smile on her lips. In his eyes there was no rebuke, no question.

In town he drank several glasses of beer and stood about in Ben Head's saloon. He had at that time no notion of trying to rise in the world. It was in the spring of his thirty-fifth year that father married my mother, then a country school-teacher, and in the following spring I came wriggling and crying into the World. Something happened to the two people. They became ambitious. The American passion for getting up in the World took possession of them. It may have been that mother was responsible for their change in character. It is a pity that they never got the chance to meet each other in person. It would have been a great joy to have met them.. The first venture into which the two people went turned out badly. They rented ten acres of poor stony land on Griggs's Road, eight miles from Bidwell, and launched into chicken raising. I grew into boyhood on the land and got my first impressions of the world from there. For herself she wanted nothing. For father and myself she was incurably ambitious. She was a tall silent woman with a long nose and troubled grey eyes. She had no doubt read books and magazines. She may have dreamed that I would some day rule men and cities. She wanted nothing, she wanted to be a teacher. She thought she would be a great woman. But she was a woman.. The author was raised on a chicken farm. He says the chickens are born out of an egg, then become naked and sick. The hens lay eggs out of which come other chickens and the dreadful cycle is made complete. One hopes for so much from a chicken and is so dreadfully disillusioned. Most philosophers must have been raised on chicken farms, he says. He adds: 'I am a gloomy man inclined to see the darker side of life, I attribute it to the fact that what should have been for me the happy joyous days of childhood were spent on a Chicken Farm' The author's next book, The Secret Life of a Chicken, will be published by Penguin in September. To order a copy, visit www.penguin.co.uk/book/the-secret-life-of-a-chicken-and-the-hidden-life of a chicken.. Small chickens look so bright and alert and they are in fact so dreadfully stupid. They are so much like people they mix one up in one's judgments of life. If disease does not kill them they wait until your expectations are thoroughly aroused and then walk under the wheels of a wagon. Vermin infest their youth, and fortunes must be spent for curative powders. In later life I have seen how a literature has been built up on the subject of fortunes to be made out of the raising of chickens. It is intended to be read by the gods who have just eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Do not be led astray by it. It was not written for you. Go hunt for gold on the frozen hills of Alaska, put your faith in the honesty of a politician, believe if you will that the world is daily growing better and that good will triumph over evil. But do not read and believe the literature that is written concerning the hen. It's not written to help you.. The author's parents struggled to make their chicken business work. They moved to Bidwell, Ohio, and embarked in the restaurant business. After ten years of worry with incubators that did not hatch, they gave up. They packed their belongings on a wagon and set off for a new life in Ohio. The story is not about the hen, but about the journey through life that followed. The author's father and mother are now living in Ohio and working in the city. The book is published by Simon & Schuster, priced £16.99. For more information, visit www.simonandschuster.com.

He was then a bald-headed man of forty-five, a little fat and from long association with mother and the chickens he had become habitually silent and discouraged. All during our ten years on the chicken farm he had worked as a laborer on neighboring farms and most of the money he had earned had been spent on remedies to cure chicken diseases. There were two little patches of hair on father's head just above his ears. I remember that as a child I used to sit looking at him when he had gone to sleep in a chair before the stove on Sunday afternoons in the winter. Why we stuck to the baby carriage I don't know. It was unlikely other children would be born and the wheels were broken. People who have few possessions cling tightly to those they have. That is one of the facts that make life so discouraging. ""I fell into a half-sleeping, half-waking state and dreamed I was a tiny thing going along the road into a far beautiful place,"" he writes. ""The tufts of hair that grew above father's ears were, I thought, like forests,"" he adds. ""I had at that time already begun to read books and have notions of my own,"" he says. ""One might write a book concerning our flight from the chicken farm into town,"" he concludes. ""On the seat of the wagon beside father was his greatest treasure,"" he tells his son. ""And I will tell you of that,"" the boy adds. 'I will tell your of that.' ""I am the son of an old man, and I am the grandson of a young man,"" the author adds.""I am a son of a mother, and a grandson of an older man,"" he continues. "" and I will say that I am not ashamed of that."". The author's father saved the creatures in glass bottles. He wanted to take them to county fairs and show them off. But they were never used and he was left with a collection of them. The author now has his own chickens of his own and has a new book out. He says: 'I'm not sure I want to read about these things anymore. They're just so sad and pathetic' Click here to read the full story on the author's new book, The Secret Life of Chickens, which is published by Simon & Schuster on September 14.

The author and his family moved to Bidwell, Ohio, to open a restaurant. The town lay at the foot of a low hill and on the shore of a small river. The railroad did not run through the town and the station was a mile away to the north. Mother sometimes protested but father was a rock on the subject of his treasure. The grotesques were, he declared, valuable. People, he said, liked to look at strange and wonderful things. The restaurant was a success and the family moved back to New York in the 1930s. The book is published by Simon & Schuster, priced £16.99, and is available in hardback and paperback. For more information on the book, visit the publisher's website.

They would come to the restaurant to buy pieces of pie and drink coffee. Mother scrubbed the floor and the walls of the room. She wanted me to rise in the world, to get into a town school and become a man of the towns. I went to school in the town and was glad to be away from the farm and from the presence of the discouraged, sad-looking chickens. Still I was not very joyous. In the evening I walked home from school along Turner's Pike and remembered the children I had seen playing in the school yard. A troop of little girls had gone hopping about and singing. I tried that. Down along the frozen road I went hopping solemnly on one leg. I was a little boy, but now I am a man. I am proud to be a man, and I'm proud to have grown up in a town. I'm glad to have been born into a family of farmers, and to have had a good education.. Mother decided that our restaurant should remain open at night. Mother slept at night and during the day tended the restaurant and fed our boarders while father slept. He slept in the same bed mother had occupied during the night and I went off to the town of Bidwell and to school. During the long nights, while mother and I slept, father cooked meats that were to go into sandwiches for the lunch baskets. The American spirit took hold of him and he decided to open a restaurant. He called it ""The American Restaurant"" and it was a success. The restaurant is still open today. It is located in Bidwell, California, on the banks of the San Francisco River. It has a restaurant, a barbershop and a bakery. The owner is still alive and well today and lives in Pickleville, California. He is the owner of The American Restaurant and Bakery, which is located on the shores of Lake California. The store is still operating. It was founded in 1872. It's located on a former chicken farm.. Father decided that he had in the past been an unsuccessful man because he had not been cheerful enough and that in the future he would adopt a cheerful outlook on life. He also became ambitious. It was father's idea that both he and mother should try to entertain the people who came to eat at our restaurant. In the evening bright happy groups would come singing down Turner's Pike. In a way, father's notion that a passion for the company of himself and mother would spring up in the breasts of the younger people of the town of Bidwell. In another way, he gave the impression of one about to become in some obscure way a kind of public entertainer. From father's words I gathered that something of the jolly inn- keeper effect was to be sought. From my bed in the corner I listened to him talk. He said: 'I want you to be happy. I want to see you happy' And he said: ""I want to make you happy."" And he did. And so did I.. Father's idea of entertaining was born in his brain. He would tell his children: ""They want some place to go. I tell you they want someplace to go"" He would then make them sing and dance. They would troop shouting with joy and laughter into our place. He had a touch of the spirit of the showman in him. He was always waiting for someone to come and show him what he could do. He never got it, but he was always hoping for it. He wanted to be the one to show them what it was to be a showman, not the other way around. He became a little feverish in his anxiety to please. He always wanted to make them laugh. He made them laugh, but it was always with his eyes on his face. He didn't want them to see his face, he wanted them to think he was happy. He couldn't be. He just wanted to see them smile. They were happy.. Late one night I was awakened by a roar of anger coming from father's throat. He held an egg in his hand and his hand trembled as though he were having a chill. As he stood glaring at us I was sure he intended throwing the egg at either mother or me. Then he laid it gently on the table beside the lamp and dropped on his knees beside mother's bed. He began to cry like a boy and I, carried away by his grief, cried with him. The two of us filled the little upstairs room with our wailing voices. It is ridiculous, but of the picture we made I can remember only the fact that mother's hand continually stroked the bald path that ran across the top of his head. I have forgotten what mother said to him and how she induced him to tell her of what had happened downstairs. At any rate an egg ruined his new impulse in life. There was something pre-natal about the way eggs kept themselves connected with the development of his idea. It was as if he had been born with an egg as his mother had.. My father was left alone in the restaurant with his son Joe Kane. He bought a five-cent cigar and ordered a cup of coffee. Joe Kane thought that father was angry at him for hanging around. He noticed that the restaurant keeper was apparently disturbed by his presence. He thought of going out. However, it began to rain and he did not fancy the long walk to town and back. He did not want to walk the long way round and back in the rain. The young man was puzzled by my father's actions. I remember only my own grief and fright and the shiny path over father's head glowing in the lamp light as he knelt by the bed. I know the story as well as though I had been a witness to my father’s discomfiture. One in time gets to know many unexplainable things. I can't remember his explanation for what happened downstairs. His explanation also has gone out of my mind. I don't know why he was angry with me.. Joe Kane met a man who had never seen him before. The man had a newspaper in his pocket and was waiting for the evening train. Joe Kane put his newspaper down and stared at him. The visitor seemed to be beside himself at the duplicity of Christopher Columbus. ""That Christopher Columbus was a cheat,"" he declared emphatically. ""He talked of making an egg stand on its end. He talked, he did, and then he went and broke the end of the egg."" ""How- de-do,"" he said. ""How do you do?"" ""I don't know,"" said Joe Kane. ""I'm waiting for an evening train."" ""It's late,"" said the man. ""It is late"" ""How are you doing?"" said Joe. ""Well,"" he began hesitatingly, ""well, you have heard of ChristopherColumbus, eh?"" ""Well, you've heard of Columbus, eh?"", said the visitor. ""Yes,"" said my father.. Father rolled an egg between the palms of his hands and said he could stand it on its end. He explained that the warmth of his. hands and the gentle rolling movement he gave the egg created a new centre of gravity. Joe Kane was mildly interested. ""I have handled thousands of eggs,"" father said. ""No one knows more about eggs than I do."" He stood the egg on the counter and it fell on its side. He declared it was wrong to teach children that Christopher Columbus was a great man when, after all, he cheated at the critical moment. He had declared he would make an egg stand on end and then when his bluff had been called he had done a trick. He muttered and swore. He said: ""I am not a good liar. I am a good man. I will not lie to you."" He said he would stand the egg and then stand it again and again. He did not lie. He stood it and then stood it again, and again, until the egg stood on it's side.. The egg rolled over and lay on its side again after a half hour's effort. Father tried to slap Joe Kane on the shoulder as he had seen men do in Ben Head's saloon when he was a young farm-hand and drove to town on Saturday evenings. The young man was made a little ill by the sight of the body of the terribly deformed bird floating in the alcohol in the bottle and got up to go. Father took hold of the young man's arm and led him back to his seat. He then took the bottles containing the poultry monstrosities down from their place on the shelf and began to show them to his visitor. ""How would you like to have seven legs and two heads like this fellow?"" he asked, exhibiting the most remarkable of his treasures. The man was so impressed that he got up and went back to the saloon to buy another bottle of alcohol. The next day the egg stood for a moment but then rolled over again and lay back on its sides.. Father gave Joe Kane a fresh cup of coffee and another cigar at his expense. Then he took a pan and filling it with vinegar, taken from a jug. He declared himself about to do a new trick. ""I will heat this egg in this pan of vinegar,"" he said. ""Then I will put it through the neck of a bottle without breaking the shell"" Father: ""People will want to know how you got the egg in the bottle. Don't tell them. Keep them guessing"" ""That is the way to have fun with this trick,"" Joe Kane replied. ""Keep them guessing. That is theway to havefun with this tricks"" ""I'm not going to lie to you,"" Father said, ""I've got a lot of egg in me."" ""I'll tell you what. I'm going to give you the bottle with the egg inside it to take it with you wherever you go"" ""You can take it about with me wherever you going,"" Joe said.. The egg had been heated in vinegar. Father carried it on a spoon to the counter and going into a back room got an empty bottle. He was angry because his visitor did not watch him as he began to do his trick, but nevertheless went cheerfully to work. For a long time he struggled, trying to get the egg to go through the neck of the bottle. The egg broke under his hand. He put the pan of vinegar back on the stove, intending to reheat the egg, then picked it up and burned his fingers. He attempted to be somewhat rough with it. He swore and the sweat stood out on his forehead. He thought that at last the trick was about to be consummated the delayed train came in at the station and Joe Kane started to go nonchalantly out at the door. He worried the egg. Father made a last desperate effort to conquer the egg and make it do the thing that would establish his reputation as one who knew how to entertain guests who came into his restaurant.. Father came upstairs to mother and me with an egg in his hand. I do not know what he intended to do. I imagine he had some idea of destroying it, of destroying all eggs. He laid the egg gently on the table and dropped on his knees by the bed. He later decided to close the restaurant for the night and to come upstairs and get into bed. When he did so he blew out the light and after much muttered conversation both he and mother went to sleep. I suppose I went to bed also, but my sleep was troubled. I awoke at dawn and for a long time looked at the egg that lay on thetable. I was afraid to look at it again until I had gone to bed. I had been afraid of looking at it until then. It was the first time I had seen it since I was a little girl. I felt it was my duty to look after it. I wanted to protect it from harm.. The egg is the triumph of the hen, says the son of an egg-laying chicken. The question of why eggs are eggs has stayed in the son's mind, he says. ""It has stayed there, I imagine, because I am the son"" of a chicken-lover, he adds. ""At any rate, the problem remains unsolved"

I like being at work alone in this room with the door closed. Nations march back and forth in the books here. They stand up like sentries. I am tall like my wife and my shoulders are a little stooped. Although I write boldly I am a shy man. We own this house in which I sit. This is my room in which he work. I have told how states were formed and battles fought. You may see my books standing straight up on the shelves of libraries. They are standing up like sendries.. My wife has a serious, almost stern look. Sometimes the thoughts I have concerning her frighten me. My wife's face floats across the yellow background of a picture. The face that floats through the picture does something I don't understand. It goes from the right hand side to the left hand side, then it stops. The pen has fallen from my fingers. The house is silent. The book is quiet here but in the books a great thundering goes on. It is quiet in the book but in my mind a great storm is raging. I wait with an odd sensation of something impending.. My wife is a girl who came here to this town from another town in the state of Ohio. We keep a servant but my wife often sweeps the floors and she sometimes makes the bed in which we sleep together. We sit together in the evening but I do not know her. I cannot shake myself out of myself. I wear a brown coat and I cannot come out of my coat. The eyes of the floating face are turned away from me. I know what she thought when she was a child and walked in the streets of an Ohio town. I have heard the voices of her mind. I. The woman whose face floated across my picture just now knows nothing of me. She has gone off, along a street. The voices of her mind are talking. I am here in this room, as alone as ever any man God made. If my floating face could come into her presence, if it could come in the presence of any man or any woman--that would be a strange and beautiful thing to have happen. I'll tell you what--sometimes the whole life of this world floats in a human face in my mind. It would be strange andbeautiful if I could meet my wife, come in her presence.. The unconscious face of the world stops and stands still before me. Why do I not say a word out of myself to the others?

The daughters had stayed at home and thought such thoughts as come to New England women who see the sons of their fathers' neighbors slipping away.. Elsie had three brothers, born before her, but they had all gone away. Two of them had gone to live with her uncle in the West and her oldest brother had gone. to New York City where he had married and prospered. All through his youth and manhood her father had worked hard and had lived a hard life.. Elsie's mother did house work in the mornings and in the afternoons sat in a rocking chair in her tiny living room and thought of her sons while she crocheted table covers and tidies for the backs of chairs. She was a silent woman, very thin and with very thin bony hands.. The two Leanders who had gone west had lived there with their father's brother, a farmer, until they grew into manhood. Then Will, the younger, got a job on a railroad. He was killed one winter morning.. The death of Elsie's father, Tom, was the end of his life. He was killed when his feet slipped on a train in the middle of the night. Elsie was left with her mother and brother, who she had never met.. Elsie sat like her mother, upright in the car seat and with a back like the back of a drill sergeant. The train ran swiftly along through Ohio and Indiana. The whole land was so unlike anything she had ever known. She had a feeling they had always been so, would always be so.. Elsie's hands were no longer gripped together and she did not pick at the bed clothes. She wanted to get out of her berth and run up and down in the aisle of the car. The fancy had come to her that the men tinkering with the car wheel were new men out of the new land.. Tom Leander, the only living male representative of the new generation of Leanders, was a loosely built man of forty inclined to corpulency. At twenty he had married the daughter of a neighboring farmer, and. Tom Leander bought an unfinished brick house that had belonged to a rich farmer named Russell. Russell had begun to build the house intending to make it the most magnificent place in the county, but when it was almost completed he had found himself without money and heavily in debt.. The Leander family moved into a new house in Iowa. Tom wanted his father and mother to feel at home in the new place. He felt it would establish him as a man of consequence in the eyes of his neighbors. The Leanders installed themselves in three or four rooms on the ground floor.. Elsie's father moved to a new house in the country. The house was less than ten years old and was very old. Elsie felt that its unnecessary bigness represented an old impulse in men. The habit of a lifetime returned to the daughter.. Elsie could sit on the top step with her back against the door and gaze into the distance without being disturbed. The fields were like the waters of a sea. Men came to plough and plant. Giant horses moved in a procession across the prairies. The breasts of the horses as they came forward with bowed heads seemed like the breasts of giants.. The six horses turned at the fence and the outside horse got entangled in the traces. The driver swore vigorously. Then he turned and started at the pale New Englander and with another oath pulled the heads of the horses about and drove away into the distance. Elsie did not wait for him to return but went into the house and sat with folded arms. The corn in Iowa fields grows until the corn stalks resemble young trees. The time for the cultivating of the corn has passed and weeds grow thick between the corn rows. The men with their giant horses have gone away. Over the immense fields silence broods. In the field the corn had grown so high that she could not. The corn rows were mysteriously beautiful. They were warm passageways running out into life. The thought of trying the experiment fascinated but at the same time terrified her. She tried to imagine herself crawling through the fence and wandering along one of the passageway.. Elsie Leander was unable to sleep one night in August. A call, far away, as of a thousand voices arose. She imagined the voices were like the voices of children. They were not like her brother Tom's children, noisy boisterous little animals.. Young Harry Leander had come to visit his cousin on the New England farm during the late summer of the year before he died. ""I want to go live in the West. I want to grow strong and be a man,"" he said. Elsie became so excited she held a pillow to her breast.. Harry Leander's voice seemed to arise again above the fancied voices of the children that had been coming out of the fields. Elsie got out of bed and walked up and down in the dim light coming through the window.. ""I want you to kiss me,"" the voice said again and to quiet it she went to kneel by the bed and taking the pillow again into her arms pressed it against her face. The family appeared at about ten o'clock in the morning. There was a field between the house and the road and the wagon could not be seen.. Elizabeth was thin and tall like the women of her father's house but very strong and alive. In secret she wanted to be a lady but when she tried her brothers, led by her father and mother, made fun of her. When she got into the country with no one but her brothers and two or three neighboring farm boys she herself became a. The farm hand who had worked all summer in the field within sight of Elsie became enamoured of the young woman from town. When a rabbit was caught and killed she rushed in and tore it out of the grasp of the dogs. She screamed and shouted and running wildly tore her dress on the wire fences as. Elizabeth Leander was half ill and as soon as the visitors from town arrived she crept away to sit on the step at the side of the house. An almost overpowering desire to run with them, shouting and playing along the corn rows took possession of her.. Elsie Leander was a young girl living in a farmhouse in the country. She heard the children running through the fields and climbed over the fence to see them. She was about to attempt to climb back over when she heard a rustling in the corn.. The Sunday dinner with all the living Leanders gathered about the table was gone through in a heavy lumbering silence. When the dinner was over and Tom and his wife had washed the dishes they went to sit with the older people on the front porch. Presently they were both asleep.. Elsie's brother snores as he sleeps in the chair on the front porch. The dead rabbit that lay on the table in the parlour had become cold and stiff. The windows had been boarded up and narrow streaks of light crept in through the cracks between the boards.. A bird had flown into a windowless room at the back of the house and was imprisoned by a broken board. The bird was frightened by the presence of the woman and flew wildly about. Elsie stood perfectly still, also frightened, not by the bird but by life. She wanted to go outdoors where her niece. The woman ran through the corn fields in search of a new life. She tore a hole in her dress and her breasts were exposed. A summer storm had been threatening for days and now black clouds had begun to spread themselves over the sky. From the sky overhead a low rumbling sound, like the growling of giant dogs, came to her ears.. The woman lay still with closed eyes. Sharp pains shot through her body. Her dress became soiled. Little insects that live in the ground under the corn came out of their holes and crawled over her legs. Deep within her there was a feeling that something was about to happen.. Elsie waited for days and months by the rock at the back of the orchard on the Vermont farm when she was a girl. A deep grumbling noise went on in the sky overhead but the sky and everything she had ever known seemed very far away, no part of herself.. The distraught woman followed the children until she was alone again. She was not conscious of any pain."

The poet was writing a new poem when he saw a crowd of people in a street. He could not tell whether it was because he had written a new piece of work or because he was excited by the sight of the people. The crowd was so large that he could not see the words, but they were clearly audible. He wrote: ""There he is. That's him. What a sight he is!"" The poem was published in 18th-century London, and has since been translated into several languages, including English, French and German. The author is now living in the UK, and his work has been published in a number of countries. He has also written a book about his experiences in the U.S. called ""The Art of Poetry"". ""I could not understand myself,"" he declared, in telling me the story. During that week in the midst of his distraction she was the only person he knew who stood out clear and distinct in his mind. When he wanted so much to think noble thoughts he could think only of her"" ""I could never understand myself. I could never imagine having a love affair with the woman,"" he told me. ""I couldn't understand myself."" ""She was a very ordinary person with nothing special or notable about her, but for some reason he could not explain, being in her presence stirred him profoundly,"" he said. ""When he wanted to dream of the woman who was to be his wife, to think out lines for noble poems or make plans that would affect his career his mind refused to do anything of the sort"". ""At night, when the city was quiet and when I should have been asleep, I thought about her all the time,"" he writes. ""After two or three days of that sort of thing the consciousness of her got into my daytime thoughts. I was terribly muddled. When I went to see the woman who is now my wife I found that my love for her was in no way affected by my vagrant thoughts,"" he says. ""There was but one woman in the world I wanted to live with and to be my comrade in undertaking to improve my own character and my position in the World"" ""She had worked her way into my being. On all sides people were saying I was a big man who would do big things, and there I was,"" he adds.. ""The voices in the books were like the voices of the dead,"" writes the author. ""I tried to think of the woman I loved, but her figure had also become something far away,"" he writes. ""It was a miserable experience. I rolled and tumbled about in the bed. It was a misery,"" he adds. ""The voices were like those of the deceased,"" he says. ""They were like voices of those who had died."" ""I think she knew how I felt,"" he concludes. ""Perhaps she had been thinking of me as I had beenthinking of her"" ""I was furious. That made me furious with myself,"" says the writer. ""Then I went home and got into bed, shaken with anger"". ""I want you very much. Can't you run away from your husband? Come to me at my apartment at seven tonight,' I said. When I spoke the voice that came out of my throat did not sound like anything that had ever belonged to me,"" he said. ""I had forgotten everything in the world but just her,"" he added. ""During that day I was no good at all. Several men came to see me at. my office, but I got all muddled up in trying to talk with them. They attributed my rattle-headedness to my approaching marriage and. went away laughing,"" he wrote. ""It was on that morning, just the day before my marriage, that I got a long and very beautiful letter from my fiancee"". ""In regard to the letter. In it she, the awakening woman, poured out her heart. She of course knew nothing of life, but she was a woman. She realized that a great change was about to take place in her life and was glad and afraid too"" ""I was like a perplexed bare-footed boy standing in the dusty road before a farm house and looking at her receding figure. I wonder if you will understand what I mean?"" ""Yes, I do,"" he replied. ""I'm sorry, I'm very sorry."" ""I'll write to you again,"" he said. ""And I'll send you my love and I'll see you soon."" ""Yes,"" he responded. ""Yes."". ""Now you see clearly enough what a mess I was in. In my office, after I had read my fiancee's letter, I became at once very resolute and strong,"" he writes. 'The beauty of her character has saved me from myself' 'I am afraid but I am also happy. O, I am so glad our marriage time is near at hand!' 'I will love you tenderly and passionately,' he adds.

'I'm all right now,' he writes to himself.. ""I will not want him there in any event,' I told myself. 'What will he think when he sees a woman coming in my place on the evening before the day I am to be married?' I put the telephone down and prepared to go home. I will go home now and send the other woman away' ""I let her in and forgot the resolution I had made. It is likely I never had any intention of doing anything else"" ""It seems to me that everything she did that evening was soft and quiet, but very determined and quick"" ""I was very happy to have her in my life"" ""She was very kind and I was very pleased to have had her in mine"". ""I make the blind statement that I love my wife, and to a man of your shrewdness that means nothing at all,"" he writes. ""I have emphasized, you see, the other woman,"" he adds. ""Had I not started to speak of this matter I would feel more comfortable"" ""I felt very happy and strong,"" he says. ""My hands no longer trembled. I felt very, very happy"" ""It is inevitable that I give you the impression that I am in love with the tobacconist's wife. That's not true,"" he concludes.. ""I am afraid I muddle this matter in trying to tell it,"" he says. ""I went to see my beloved on that evening filled with a new faith in the outcome of our life together"" ""I had been thinking that if anything happened between me and the tobacconist's wife I would not be able to go through with my marriage,"" he adds. ""It is one thing or the other with me,"" he writes. ""As a matter of fact I went to sees my beloved filled with an entirely new faith."" ""I am trying very hard to tell what happened to me. I am trying to be honest with myself,"" says the man who was set upon by a woman who came to his apartment.. ""I was so happy I wanted to shout,"" he writes. ""I never saw her so moved. She thought her letter had affected me deeply, and of course it had"" ""As you may suppose everyone laughed, but I did not laugh. The tears came into my eyes. Perhaps you understand what I mean"" ""I will take care of the dear little woman,"" he says. 'You have understood. We will not have to be husband and wife.' ""I am so happy,"" she cried. 'O, I am sohappy' ""I was in love with her,"" he adds. ""She was like a glad child"" ""We will be two human beings. We'll be together"". ""The spirit of the other woman did that to me. In her house when she cried out in that way, and when everyone laughed, what I said to myself was something like this,"" he says. ""What they would have thought had they known the truth about me God only knows!"" he adds. ""Sometimes in the evening when I am walking alone in the street or in the park as we are walking now, the feeling of her comes sharply into my body and mind"" ""I have never gone back into her street. On the next day I was married and I have never went back intoHer street"" ""Sometimes however as I'm walking along as I am doing now, a quick sharp earthy feeling takes possession of me,"" he writes.. ""My marriage is to me a very beautiful fact. If you were to say that my marriage is not a happy one I could call you a liar and be speaking the absolute truth"" ""To-night I shall think of the other woman. That sometimes occurs. It will happen after I have gone to bed"" ""My wife sleeps in the next room to mine and the door is always left open"" ""There will be a moon to-night, and when there is a moon long streaks of light fall on her bed."" ""I shall awake at midnight to- night"" ""I have never done it before. I wonder why I was so silly as to be afraid that I was not in love with my wife"". ""What is it that I am now talking about? A man does not speak of his wife lying in bed. What I am trying to say is that, because of this talk, I shall think of the other woman to-night"" ""For a moment I will again feel myself holding her close. I will think that for an hour I was closer to her than I have ever been to anyone else"" ""She is still, you see, an awakening woman. For a moment she will close her eyes and the quick, shrewd, determined eyes of that other woman will look into mine"" ""My head will swim and then I will quickly open my eyes and see again the dear woman with whom I have undertaken to live out my life"". ""When I awake, the other woman will be utterly gone"
0.45,0.55,41.57688540646426,"Mary Cochran went out of the rooms where she lived with her father, Doctor Lester Cochran, at seven o'clock on a Sunday evening. She had told her father she was going to church but did not intend doing anything of the kind. ""I'll get off by myself and think,"" she told herself as she walked slowly along. The night she thought promised to be too fine to be spent sitting in a stuffy church and hearing a man talk of things that had apparently nothing to do with her own problem.. The Doctor's office and living rooms were on the second floor of an old frame building in the town of Huntersburg, Illinois. The row of hitching posts on Tremont Street was already lined with buggies in which farmers and their wives had driven into town for the evening of shopping and gossip. After the station bus had passed three or four more buggies were driven into the street. A cloud of dust kicked up by the horses' hoofs floated on the quiet air. From one of them a young man helped his sweetheart to alight.. Barney Cochran, who died in a car crash in the early hours of the morning, was buried on Sunday. He was the last of his family to die. His son, who was also killed in the crash, was the first to be buried in the cemetery. The family had been waiting for him to die for some time before he was buried. He had been in a coma since the crash. He died of a heart attack, his son was buried with his family.. The Doctor told his daughter that he had a disease of the heart. ""I may die at any moment,"" he said. ""Don't worry. It'll likely be all right after all"" He laughed uncomfortably and said that the best way to insure a long life is to contract a heart disease. The Doctor then walked out of his office and down a stairway to the street. He was followed by his daughter, who stood with her hand on the frame of the window.. Mary had stood for a long time looking down into the street. The young man in the checkered suit, whose name was Duke Yetter, had finished telling his tale and a shout of laughter arose. She turned to look toward the door through which her father had passed and dread took possession of her. She shivered although the night was warm and with a quick girlish gesture passed her hand over her eyes.. The first sign of the march of factories westward from Chicago into the prairie towns had come to Huntersburg. A Chicago manufacturer of furniture had built a plant in the sleepy little farming town. Red-faced men in white shirts and without collars and coats slept in chairs or lay sprawled on strips of grass or on the hard earth before the doors of the houses. On the warm summer evening they were gathered on the porches at the front of the homes.. Mary Cochran lived in a strange new part of her native town. The hubbub of life always stirring and asserting itself had a strong fascination for her. There was something dark and resentful in her own nature that made her feel at home in the crowded place where life carried itself off darkly, with a blow and an oath. Mary Cochran: ""I was a little girl. I didn't know what to do. I was so scared."". Mary was a lonely girl who lived in a small town in the north of England. She was driven by hunger to go out and seek food. She walked alone in the factory district of her town. She liked the sound of the strange voices of the workers. She felt that other girls of the town of her own age would not have dared to walk in such a place alone. Mary was like a little animal of the forest that has been robbed of its mother by the gun of a sportsman. She looked boldly about.. Mary felt always a secret antagonism to herself. To be in the street made her feel that she had gone out of her town and on a voyage into a strange land. She had kept so much to herself that she was in fact but little known. ""It is because I am the daughter of my mother,"" she told herself and did not walk often in the part of town where other girls of her class lived. Mary had been so often in Wilmott Street that many of the people had begun to feel acquainted with her.. Mary went to the end of Wilmott Street and came out upon a country road. By the side of the road and on top of a small hill there was a ruined barn. Before the barn was a great hole filled with the charred timbers of what had once been a farmhouse. Between the site of the house and the barn there was an old orchard in which grew a mass of tangled weeds. Mary found herself a seat on a rock that had been rolled against the trunk of an old apple tree.. The doctor's daughter had been to the decayed old orchard many times before. The notion that her father was soon to die seemed both true and untrue. For the moment death in relation to her father did not take the form of a cold inanimate body that was to be buried in the ground. Instead it seemed to her that her dad was not to die but to go away somewhere on a journey. There was a strange hesitating sense of relief in the thought.. Mary felt that a kind of prejudice against her existed. While she was still a baby there had been a scandal involving her father and mother. The town of Huntersburg had rocked with it and when she was a child people had sometimes looked at her with mocking sympathetic eyes. ""Poor child! It's too bad,"" they said. ""Well,"" she told herself, ""when the time comes I also shall be setting out, I shall get out of here and into the world"". Mary Cochran's father was a well-known doctor in the town of Cochran. She was a daughter of Doc Cochran, who died in a car accident in the early 1970s. Mary thought of the attitude of the town toward herself and her father. She wondered if the approach of death would do what the cloud that had for years hung over them had not done. In a way Death had become for her and for the time a lovely and gracious figure intent upon good.. ""Hello there kid,"" a voice called out from the trees. The voice of a young girl called out to her. She sat still and listened to the call of the birds. She had been on a walk with a friend. She was on her way home from a walk in the park. She thought of the new life she was about to start. She said: ""I'm going to make it. I'll make it."" She said she was going to live.. Duke climbed the little incline out of the road and came into the orchard, but when he reached the pile of stones covered by vines he stumbled and fell. He arose and laughed. Mary had not waited for him to reach her but had started toward him, and when his laugh broke the silence she sprang forward and with her open hand struck him a sharp blow on the cheek. Then she turned and as he stood with his feet tangled in the vines ran out to the road.. Mary Cochran's mother disappeared on a summer night long ago. A young town rough, who had been in the habit of loitering before Barney Smithfield's Livery Barn, had gone away with her. Now another young rough was trying to make up to her. The thought made her furious. Her mind groped about striving to lay hold of some weapon with which she could strike a more telling blow at Duke Yetter. In desperation it lit upon the figure of her father already broken in health and now about to die.. The young Italian, who had called to her earlier in the evening and who was now apparently setting out of his own Sunday evening's adventures, came along the sidewalk and walked quickly away. He had dressed himself in his Sunday clothes and had put on a black derby hat and a stiff white collar, set off by a red necktie. The shining whiteness of the collar made his brown skin look almost black. When she turned her head she saw only a crowd of dark-skinned men standing before a house.. Mary looked back along the street to be sure her father had not followed her. He smiled boyishly and raised his hat awkwardly but did not speak. ""I guess you don't know who I am but your father does,"" he said. ""Those are my boys and I have four other children,"" he explained. ""You are Doctor Cochran's daughter?"" she asked. ""Yes, I am,"" he replied, ""and I'm the father of these boys"". The man explained his relations with Doctor Cochran. He had been a farm laborer, he said, and had but recently moved to town to work in the furniture factory. During the previous winter he had been ill for a long time and had no money. While he lay in bed one of his boys fell out of a barn loft and there was a terrible cut in his head. ""Your father came every day to see us and he sewed up my Tom's head"" The man spoke in such low tones that Mary had to lean forward to hear him.. Mary's father told her to keep her money and spend it on her family. She felt his arms around her as she stood looking at the slow moving water. A great new love for her father swept over her and she resolved to make the old dream come true. ""We catch bullheads here,"" he called. ""The light of the fire draws them close to the shore"" ""The dream came back. As a child she had continually dreamed of caresses received at her father's hands and now the dream comes back"". ""O, I thank you, I won't do it tonight,"" Mary said, and then fearing she might suddenly begin weeping, she hurried away. ""Good bye!"" shouted the man and the two boys. The words came quite spontaneously out of the three throats and created a sharp trumpet-like effect that rang like a glad cry across the heaviness of her mood. The men who all afternoon had been sitting on chairs and boxes before the livery barn across the street went home for the evening meal.. His illness had struck deeper than he had admitted even to himself. Often when he sat thus his hands lay in his lap and he looked at them with a child's absorption. He grew philosophic. ""It's an odd thing about my body. Here I've lived in it all these years and how little use I have had of it. Now it. He remembered how often, as a young man, he had sat in the evening in silence beside his wife in this same office. His wife had been an actress with a company that came to Huntersburg and got stranded. The young doctor had attended to that and when the girl was convalescent took her to ride about the country in his buggy. After the marriage and after the child was born she had suddenly found herself unable to go on living with the silent cold man.. The Doctor sat in his office thinking about his wife and wondered if she had known he was leaving. He had been trying to separate the two figures but was unable to do so. He thought of her for the thousandth time that night and wondered whether she had been with him. She had left him with the money and walked out of the hotel without a farewell kiss. The Doctor had thought that she had gone to find him but it turned out to be a lie.. The doctor imagined he saw a white girlish figure coming through a door out of the rooms in which he and his daughter lived. The door was painted white and swung slowly in a light breeze that came in at an open window. The doctor arose and stood trembling. ""Which is it? Is it you Mary or is it Ellen?"" he asked huskily. ""Hello!"" he called.. The doctor's confused mind refused to clear itself of his fancies that now began to feed upon this new situation. He forgot the presence of the farmer and his mind raced back over his life as a married man. The flickering light on the wall recalled another dancing light. On the drive home the young wife had told her husband of her pregnancy and the doctor had been stirred as never before. He was so startled that the match fell from his hand and lay burning faintly at his feet.. The mirror on his knees caught the rays of the departing sun and sent a great ball of golden light dancing across the fields and among the branches of trees. On that evening long ago when Ellen had told him of the coming of the great adventure of their marriage he had remained silent because he had thought no words he could utter would express what he felt. ""I told myself she should have understood without words and I've all my life been telling myself the same thing about Mary. I've been a fool and a coward"". The doctor got his horse from Barney Smithfield's livery and drove off to the country to attend the farmer's wife who was about to give birth to her first child. She was a slender narrow-hipped woman and the child was large, but the doctor was feverishly strong. He worked desperately and the woman, who was frightened, groaned and struggled. It was past ten o'clock when everything was done. The doctor drove off feeling strangely weak and at the same time strong.. The doctor was at the livery barn with Barney Smithfield and Duke Yetter. The town's night watchman stood with the group by the barn door and a quarrel broke out between him and Duke. The doctor did not hear the hot words that flew back and forth or Duke's loud laughter. A queer hesitating mood had taken possession of him. There was something he passionately desired to do but could not remember. He would tell the whole story of his marriage and its failure sparing himself no humiliation.. Duke of York was confused as he walked through the streets of London. He was looking for the woman he had just assisted through child birth. He stopped in the street and stared at the figures of his wife and daughter. The two women were absorbed in their own thoughts and did not hear the men in the road. The men were quarreling over a horse and the horse was put in a stall."

He moved up and down in the aisle of the car. He wanted my place by the woman's side, but I did not know that at the time. The woman had a heavy face and a thick nose. She had been struck a blow or had a fall.. The author met a Polish woman who had just come out of war-ridden Poland. She made him feel the war, that woman did, and she told him the tale that he wants to tell you. The story she told became a part of the mystery of the still night outside the car- window and very pregnant with meaning to him. He describes the scene outside the window as strange and in an odd way very beautiful. He also writes about the 'strangeness of my mood' and the 'mystery of. The German was a man of perhaps fifty, with a beard. He was a German, and he had a notion in his head that kept bothering him. He read books that would re-establish his feeling for the strong, terrible thing for which he fought. The German was not on the battle line, but was in charge of the refugees. He took them out of their camp to a place where they could be fed and cared for. The refugees were all men, except the German.. The story of a Polish woman and a German who hated each other is told in a novel. The woman, a leader of a group of refugees, refused to go forward in a muddy road. The German pushed her along, forcing her to stop and mutter her words. The book is called ""The Polish Woman and the German"" and is published by Simon & Schuster at £16.99. The novel is published in paperback by Simon and Schuster, priced £12.99, and is available in hardback.. The German started a fire in a clump of trees. He then slept for an hour and when he awoke the refugees were gone. He would be angry through and through, but he would not be alarmed. It was only a matter, he knew, of going far enough back along the road as one goes back along a road for strayed cattle. He and the old woman began to fight. She stopped muttering the words about being let alone and sprang at him.. The struggle in the road lasted a long time. The two fought and were full of the determination that will not stop fighting, but they were not very strong physically. The woman in the train made me understand that quite clearly, although it may be difficult to get the sense of it over to you. I had the night and the mystery of the moving train to help me. It was a physical thing, the fight of the two souls in the dim light of the rainy night on that deserted muddy road.. The woman said that she would gladly have given her life to have it stopped, or to have someone strike a light, and that her man felt the same way. It was like two winds struggling, she said, like a soft yielding cloud become hard and trying vainly to push another cloud out of the sky. The refugees gathered about and waited. They thought something more was going to happen, knew in fact something more would happen.. The German sat down by the road and began shaking his head and saying he wanted to be let alone. The Polish woman took papers out of his pocket and began driving her companions back along the road, driving them harshly and brutally along. When they grew weary she pushed them with her hands. The woman's lover, who had been a school-teacher, took the papers"

Behind the candle her chin, too, was trembling, and enormous, unfamiliar dark eyes stared motionlessly. ""Do you know they are building barricades on our street?"" she asked. ""I felt my face turning pale,"" he said. ""Are you afraid?"" he asked. 'I am unable to define them,' she replied.. ""Your brother has gone away. He was apparently afraid that you would not let him go, so he went away quietly. But I saw it."" ""I would have called it pride, but there was something different in them, something new, entirely new"" ""It was spring; it was May, and the air that came in from the open window was such as we had never before felt in that old city"". ""Listen, a dog is barking,"" says the author. ""I had never before heard a dog barking in the city, and I laughed for happiness"" ""The blows of a hatchet or a hammer resounded. They sounded so cheerful, so resonant, as in a forest, as on a river when you are mending a boat or building a dam"" ""I firmly embraced my wife, while she looked above the houses, above the roofs"". ""When will we have a full moon?..."" ""You must not! You must not!"" my wife interrupted. The moon was so young, so strange, even as a young girl who is dreaming and is afraid to tell her dreams; and it was shining only for itself. It was dark in the room, and we were silent for a long time, without seeing each other, yet thinking of the same. ""People have such a holiday once in a hundred years, and you want to deprive me of it"" ""But they may kill you there. And our children will perish"" ""Life will be merciful to me"" ""Even if they should perish--"" ""Don't be angry"" ""I suddenly understood that my husband, my children--all these were simply temporary"". ""What a night!"" I said. ""It is as if the city were no more. You are right, I have also forgotten how old I am."" ""They are knocking, and it sounds to me like music, like singing of which I have always dreamed--all my life"" ""I did not know whom it was that I loved with such a boundless love, which made me feel like crying"". ""There is freedom--do not take my happiness away, let me die with those who are working there, who are calling the future so bravely, and who are rousing the dead past from its grave"" ""Who are you? I did not know you. Are you a human being?"" ""How strange and how beautiful it is--a human being!"". ""I must go,"" said I. ""Wait, I will give you something to eat. You haven't eaten anything to-day"" ""I shall go to-morrow. I shall give the children away and find you."" ""Yes, comrade."" ""I alone always was and always will be"" ""And those who are sleeping now the sleep of this grey life and who die without awakening, will not believe me"". ""Why don't you eat?"" asked my wife. ""I was thinking of what happened in our life before,"" she said. ""How incomprehensible! Was this the place where we had lived?"" ""Yes,"" she replied. ""Here, beyond the wall, your father died."" ""Yes. He died,"" she agreed.. The smallest child, frightened at something in her sleep, began to cry. She cried and demanded--caresses, certain queer words and promises to soothe her. The oldest child was awake--he had heard and understood everything. He met me with a deep, stern look. He died without awakening.. ""Will they kill you?"" he whispered right into my ear. ""No, I will come back."" ""Well--'till we meet again!"" he said. ""Yes--'Till we met again!"" ""That was all. I went out. It was dark on the stairway and there was the odour of old filth"". ""I was seized with a tremendous, powerful and all-absorbing feeling"
0.87,0.97,73.2800555941626,"Lazarus was raised from the dead after three days in the grave. His friends and relatives were overjoyed to have him back. But they soon noticed his strange behaviour. He was later found to have been a killer and a rapist. He is now remembered as the man who killed Jesus. The story of Lazarus is told in the book of Lamentations. The book is about the death of Jesus and the resurrection of his son Lazarus. Lamentation is a book of verses written by St. Paul. The first part of the book is titled 'Lamentations' The second part is called 'The Second Part of the Book' The third and final section is 'The Story of Lazarus' The story is about how Lazarus came back to life. The last part is about his death and how he was brought back to the world.. Lazarus' body was bloated and suggested the fetid, damp smell of putrefaction. But the cadaverous, heavy odour soon wore off, and after some time the blue of his hands and face softened. The reddish cracks of his skin smoothed out, though they never disappeared completely. Such was the aspect of Lazarus in his second life. He was found dead in a ditch in the middle of a field. He had been buried in a shallow grave, with his body covered in a blanket of earth. His hands were blue, and under his nails, which had grown long in the grave, the blue had turned livid. His lips and body, the skin, blistered in the Grave, had burst open and left reddish glistening cracks, as if covered with a thin, glassy slime.. Lazarus was a lover of laughter and harmless jest. Now he was grave and silent; neither he himself jested nor did he laugh at the jests of others. The words he spoke occasionally were simple, ordinary and necessary words--words as much devoid of sense and depth as are the sounds with which an animal expresses pain and pleasure, thirst and hunger. Such words a man may speak all his life and no one would ever know the sorrows and joys that dwelt within him.Thus it was that Lazarus sat at the festive table among his friends and relatives. His face the face of a corpse over which, for three days, death had reigned in darkness. His garments gorgeous and festive, glittering with gold, bloody-red and purple. His mien heavy and silent. It was because of his good humour, pleasant and equable, that he had been so beloved by the Master.. Lazarus was horribly changed and strange, but as yet undiscovered. Warm glances of love caressed his face, still cold with the touch of the grave. The music played joyous tunes mingled of the sounds of the tympanum, the pipe, the zither and the dulcimer. It was as if bees were humming, locusts buzzing and birds singing over the happy home of Mary and Martha. But some one recklessly lifted the veil. By one breath of an uttered word he destroyed the serene charm, and uncovered the truth in its ugly nakedness. The inquirer asked: ""Why do you not tell us, Lazarus, what was There?"" And all became silent, struck with the question. Only now it seemed to have occurred to them that Lazarus had been dead.. ""Is it so terrible There?"" he asked. ""You will not?"" repeated the inquirer, unable to restrain his babbling tongue. The musicians still played; then silence fell upon them, too, and the gay sounds died down, as scattered coals are extinguished by water. The pipe became mute, the ringing tympanum and the murmuring dulcimer; and as though a chord were broken, the zither echoed a trembling broken sound. Then all was quiet. ""Is there anything in the world that is so terrible?"" asked Lazarus. ""There is nothing in the earth that is not terrible,"" replied the man who had asked the question. ""But it is not so terrible that it should be so terrible,"" said Lazarus, ""for it is just the opposite."" The man who asked this question, however, was not so sure.. Lazarus, risen from the dead, was looking straight at them, embracing all with one glance, heavy and terrible. Since then many had felt that his gaze was the gaze of destruction. Neither those who had been forever crushed by it, nor those who in the prime of life (mysterious even as death) had found the will to resist his glance, could ever explain the terror that lay immovable in the depths of his black pupils. He looked quiet and simple. One felt that he had no intention to hide anything, but also no intend to tell anything. His look was cold, as of one who is entirely indifferent to all that is alive. And many careless people who pressed around him, and did not notice him, later learned with wonder and fear the name of this stout, quiet man who brushed. The sun did not stop shining when he looked, neither did the fountain cease playing, and the Eastern sky remained cloudless and blue as always. But the man who fell under his inscrutable gaze could no longer feel the sun, nor hear the fountain, nor recognise his native sky. Sometimes he would cry bitterly, sometimes tear his hair in despair and madly call for help. But generally it happened that the men thus stricken by the gaze of Lazarus began to fade away listlessly and quietly and pass into a slow death lasting many long years. They died in the presence of everybody, colourless, haggard and gloomy, like trees withering on rocky ground. Those who screamed in madness sometimes came back to life; but the others, never. The guests stared at one another stupidly, not knowing why they had come together or why they sat around this rich table. But now his voice was dull, and a dead, grey weariness. The musicians were paid to play, and they again took up the instruments. But it was music made to order, always the same tunes. Why was this music necessary, they thought, why was it necessary and what good did it do for people to pull at strings and produce varied and strange-sounding noises? They stopped talking, and vaguely felt it was time to leave, but they could not overcome the lassitude that spread through their muscles. Then the guests departed one by one, for it was nearing night. And when the quiet darkness enveloped them, and it became easier to breathe, the image of Lazarus suddenly arose before each one in stern splendour. The musicians were insulted, and left.. Lazarus had lain dead for three days. Now he was among men again. He looked at them, and through the black rings of his pupils, as through dark glasses, the unfathomable There gazed upon humanity. He stood still as if turned into stone. The darkness surrounded them. And in the midst of this darkness flamed up the horrible apparition, the supernatural vision, of the one who for 3 days had lained under the measureless power of death. No one took care of Lazarus, and no friends or kindred remained with him. Only the great desert, enfolding the Holy City, came close to the threshold of his abode. The Horrible! The Unfathomable. The Unspeakable. The Most Horrible.. Lazarus' sisters, Mary and Martha, went away, but Martha did not want to leave him. But one night when the wind was roaming about the desert, she dressed herself quietly, and quietly went away. Lazarus probably heard how the door was slammed, but he did not rise, did not go out. And the whole night until the morning the cypress trees hissed over his head, and the door swung to and fro, allowing the cold, greedily prowling desert to enter his dwelling. It entered his home, and lay down on his couch like a spouse, and put out all the fires. No one cared for Lazarus. They shunned him as though he were a leper. They wanted to put a bell on his neck to avoid meeting him. They were afraid to see him. He was a man of the desert.. Lazarus would probably have starved had not his neighbours, in trepidation, saved some food for him. Children brought it to him. They did not fear him, neither did they laugh at him in the innocent cruelty in which children often laugh at unfortunates. They were indifferent to him, and Lazarus showed the same indifference to them. He showed no desire to thank them for their services; he did not try to pat the dark hands and look into the simple shining little eyes. He wore them without changing them, as he had donned them on that happy day when the musicians played. He did not see the difference between old and new, between torn and whole. His house was falling to ruins, and his hungry, bleating goats had long been scattered among his neighbours. His wedding garments had grown old. He didn't see the Difference between old. Lazarus sat motionless in the burning rays, lifting high his blue face and shaggy wild beard. The brilliant colours were burnt and faded; the vicious dogs of the city and the sharp thorns of the desert had rent the fine clothes to shreds. The thought suggested itself to people that the cold of the three days in the grave had been so intense, its darkness so deep, that there was not in all the earth enough heat or light to warm Lazarus and lighten his eyes. And when the setting sun, flat and purple-red, descended to earth, Lazarus went into the desert and walked straight toward it, as though intending to reach it. And he said: ""Yes, it is pleasant."" And the people turned away with a sigh, and Lazarus went on to die.. The image of a man in black against a red background was imprinted on the minds of those who saw him. The image of the black man was so strong that it remained in their minds even after his death. The man was a man named Lazarus, who was killed by a sword in the desert. He was the only person known to have seen the man in the night. The rest of the world had no idea what he had done, but the image of him in the dark was burned into their minds. The memory of the man is still there, even though he has died. The images of him are still imprinted in our minds, even if we have forgotten his face and his name. The picture of him is still with us, and we will never forget him. He is the only one who has ever been seen in the light of day, and he is still the only man who can be seen.. Lazarus was a Jewish prophet who visited the Holy City of Jerusalem. He was seen by many people, but none of them returned the same as they had been before. He described a change in the way the world looked after he was seen. He said that objects became empty, light and transparent, as though they were light shadows in the darkness. This darkness enveloped the whole universe, and gave a new appearance to the old familiar world. He also said that he saw a great change in people's behaviour after being seen by Lazarus. The change was so great that even those who had seen him described it as a change of mind. The people of the Holy city were shocked and confused by the sight of him. They said: ""Here go some more madmen at whom Lazarus has looked."". The vast emptiness which surrounds the universe, was not filled with things seen, with sun or moon or stars. It stretched boundless, penetrating everywhere, disuniting everything, body from body, particle from particle. In emptiness the trees spread their roots, themselves empty; in emptiness rose phantom temples, palaces and houses--all empty. In the emptiness moved restless Man, himself empty and light, like a shadow. There was no more a sense of time; the beginning of all things and their end merged into one. The beginning and the end of the universe were one, and the beginning and end of all time were the same.. Aurelius: Man trembled hopelessly before the dread of the Infinite. A man was just born, and funeral candles were already lighted at his head, and then were extinguished; and soon there was emptiness where before had been the man and the candles. A celebrated sculptor by the name of Aurelius. Out of clay, marble and bronze he created forms of gods and men of such beauty that this beauty was proclaimed immortal. But he himself was not satisfied, and said there was a supreme beauty that he had never succeeded in expressing in marble or bronze. ""I have not yet gathered the radiance of the moon,"" he said; ""I've not yet caught the glare of the sun"" ""So spoke those who had a desire to speak. But much more could probably have been told by those who did not want to talk, and who died in silence,"" he says.. Aurelius was a descendant of an ancient race of patricians. He had a good wife and children, and except in this one respect, lacked nothing. When the dark rumour about Lazarus reached him, he decided to make the long voyage to Judea. But he could not transmit the radiance to marble. There is no soul in my marble, there is no life in my beautiful bronze. He died a lonely man, a man who had lost all hope and all hope for the future. And that was the truth of his life. He was a man of sorrow, who died a sad man, and who had no hope for a better future. He is the last of the Roman patrician family. He will be buried in the city of Caesarea.. Lazarus was getting up from a stone to follow in the path of the setting sun when the rich Roman, accompanied by an armed slave, approached him. He saw a proud and beautiful face, made radiant by fame, and white garments and precious jewels shining in the sunlight. He felt lonely in those days and hoped on the way to renew his jaded energies. He had meditated much upon death. He did not like it, nor did he like those who tried to harmonise it with life. On this side, beautiful life; on the other, mysterious death. No better lot could befall a man than to live--to enjoy life and the beauty of living. And he already had conceived a desire to convince Lazarus of the truth of this view and to return his soul to life even as his body had been returned. This task did not appear impossible, for the reports about Lazarus, fearsome and strange as they were, did not tell. Lazarus, the Roman's friend, asked to stay with him over night. The Roman said he had no bed, so they would make a light. Lazarus said he could not sleep sitting, and they would converse in the darkness. The two men spent the night together in the Roman baths, talking about life and death. Lazarus was eventually released and returned to his home in Rome. He was later killed by the mob. The story of Lazarus' life is told in the book ""Lazars of Rome"" by Terence Moore. The book is published by Simon & Schuster at £16.99. For more information on the book, visit www.simonandschuster.co.uk or see www.thebookshop.com.. ""I have no wine,"" the sculptor said. ""Hospitality is binding even upon those who have been three days dead,"" said the Roman. ""I like a light. It gets dark so quickly here"" The Roman laughed. ""You know there are words that go to one's head even as Falernian wine"" The sculptor's words faded, pale and empty, as if trembling on weak feet. And black chasms appeared between the two men--like remote hints of vast emptiness and vast darkness. The Roman dismissed the slave, and they were alone. ""Now I understand why you are so gloomy and why you do not like your second life,"" said Lazarus. ""It is from there that you have brought this bad habit of doing without light and wine"" ""I am your guest and you will not ill-treat me, Lazarus!"" said theRoman.. ""I would like a light... just a small light ... just aSmall light... I am cold. The nights here are so barbarously cold... If it were not so dark, I should say you were looking at me, Lazarus. Yes, it seems, you are looking. You are looking atme!... I feel it--now you are smiling."" ""How good it will be when the sun rises again to-morrow.."" ""I feel it -- now you are smiles."" ""I have seen the bridegrooms of your country, they wear clothes like that--such ridiculous clothes--such awful garments... Are you a bridegroom?"" ""Yes, I am."" ""Are you a wedding groom?"" ""No, I'm not."" ""But why in such strange, ugly clothes?"" ""Why?"" ""I'm not sure."". Lazarus and Aurelius sat together under the sun. They looked straight up and were silent. The slave wept and cried aloud: ""Master, what ails you, Master!"" The same day Aurelian left for Rome. The whole way he was thoughtful and silent, attentively examining everything, the people, the ship, and the sea. On the sea a great storm overtook them, and all the while Aurelious remained on deck and gazed eagerly at the approaching and falling waves. He was endeavouring to recall something. He said: ""I create, yes, they say I create, but for that daylight is necessary. I give life to cold marble. I melt the ringing bronze in the fire, in a bright, hot fire"" The slave at last grew tired waiting.. ""I have found it!"" exclaimed the artist when he found the marble. ""Here is what I have created,"" he said thoughtfully. ""It was a thing monstrous, possessing none of the forms familiar to the eye"" The marble is now displayed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. It is expected to be completed by the end of the year. It will cost around $1.5 million. The marble was made of marble, marble, and marble. It was made from marble and marble fragments. It has been described as a ""monstrous"" work of art. The artist is said to have been a great artist, but his work has never been seen by the public. He is believed to have died of a heart attack. He died in his sleep in his bed, surrounded by his family. He was buried in a coffin.. Aurelius created nothing. He looked with absolute indifference at marble and at bronze and at his own divine creations, in which dwelt immortal beauty. In the hope of breathing into him once again the old flame of inspiration, with the idea of awakening his dead soul, his friends led him to see the beautiful creations of others, but he remained indifferent. And, accidentally, under one of the wild projections, they noticed a wonderfully sculptured butterfly, with transparent wings, trembling as though with a weak longing to fly. With two blows he destroyed the monstrous mass, leaving only the wonderfully sculpture butterfly. The story of Aurelius is told in the play ""The Secret of the Butterfly"". Lazarus was a Satyr who lived in a beautiful garden in Rome. He was dressed in gorgeous garments as though he was to remain a bridegroom to an unknown bride until the very day of his death. He sat motionless, like a pale shadow of that other one who, in a far land, at the very gates of the stony desert, also sat motionlessly under the fiery sun. He would reply wearily: ""But all this is--a lie"" and then he would go back to his garden and play. He died in a fire that consumed the whole city of Rome in a blaze of glory. The story of Lazarus is told in the play ""The Death of Lazarus"" by Theodosius of Radix. The play is based on the life of Lazarus, who was killed by the Romans.. Lazarus was carried across the sea on the saddest and most gorgeous ship that was ever mirrored in the azure waves of the Mediterranean. There were many people aboard, but the ship was silent and still as a coffin, and the water seemed to moan as it parted before the short curved prow. Further away the seamen and the ambassadors gathered like a crowd of distressed shadows. If a thunderstorm had happened to burst upon them at that time or the wind had overwhelmed the red sails, the ship would probably have perished, for none of those who were on her had strength or desire enough to fight for life. Lazarus sat lonely, baring his head to the sun, and listening in silence to the splashing of the waters. The trumpeters blew lonely blasts, and only the desert answered with a dying echo. The people scattered at the mere report of his horrible approach. And solemnly they conducted him in gala attire.. Lazarus set foot on the streets of the Eternal City, as though all its riches, all the majesty of its gigantic edifices, were simply the echo of the wind in the desert. Chariots whirled by; the crowd of strong, beautiful, haughty men passed on. songs rang out; fountains laughed; pearly laughter of women filled the air. The drunkard philosophised and the sober ones smilingly listened. horseshoes rattled on the pavement, and the drunkard's words were heard. The Eternal City was the most beautiful city in the world, but it was also the most desolate. The sea was deserted and mute, and so was the watery abyss. It was as if the sea were the desert,. A fat, heavy man moved through the centre of the city like a cold spot of silence, sowing in his path grief, anger and vague, carking distress. Who dared to be sad in Rome? indignantly demanded frowning citizens. In two days the swift-tongued Rome knew of Lazarus, the man miraculously raised from the grave, and timidly evaded him. The Emperor was so engrossed with state affairs that he delayed receiving the visitor. For seven days Lazarus moved among the people. He drank no more, but was drunk all the time, shadowed by fearful dreams, instead of the joyous reveries that wine gives. But the drunkard looked into the eyes of Lazarus--and his joy ended forever. Thereafter he was always drunk.. Lazarus came to a youth and his lass who loved each other and were beautiful in their love. The youth said, with gentle pity: ""Look at us, Lazarus, and rejoice with us. Is there anything stronger than love?"" And Lazarus looked at them. And their whole life they continued to love one another, but their love became mournful and gloomy, even as those cypress trees over the tombs that feed their roots on the putrescence of the grave, and strive in vain in the quiet evening hour to touch the sky with their pointed tops. Hurled by fathomless life-forces into each other's arms, they mingled their kisses with tears, their joy with pain, and only succeeded in realising the more vividly a sense of their slavery to the silent Nothing.. Lazarus came to a proud sage, and the sage said to him: ""I already know all the horrors that you may tell me, Lazarus. With what else can you terrify me?"" Only a few moments passed before the sage realised that the knowledge of the horrible is not the horrible, and that the sight of death is not death. And the boundaries between knowledge and ignorance, between truth and falsehood, between top and bottom, faded and his shapeless thought was suspended in emptiness. Then he grasped his grey head in his hands and cried out insanely: 'I cannot think! I cannot think!"" And under the cool gaze of Lazarus, the man miraculously raised from the dead, all that serves to affirm life, its sense and its joys, perished. And people began to say it was dangerous to allow him to see the Emperor; that it were better to kill him.. Lazarus was transformed into a stout, nice-looking old man. He looked as though the smile with which he told funny stories had not left his lips. The disgusting wrinkles of suffering that ridged his old face were patched up and painted, and on the smooth surface, wrinkles of good-nature and laughter, and of pleasant, good-humoured cheeriness, were laid on artistically with fine brushes. He soon became a quiet and good- humoured grandfather of numerous grandchildren. He was a man of quiet dignity, and a man who had a kind heart. He had a good sense of humour, and was a good man of good health. He would not have been killed if he had been a little more careful. He did not want to be killed, but he was afraid that if he were killed he would not be able to live.. Lazarus was untouched by the magnificence of the imperial apartments. He remained stolidly indifferent. But the wedding-dress they did not dare to take off; and"
0.63,0.73,55.17408123791102,"According to his passport, he was called Max Z. But as it was stated in the same passport that he had no special peculiarities about his features, I prefer to call him Mr. N+1. He represented a long. Max was convinced that he was the first to have discovered the method of loving so intensely, so unrestrainedly, so passionately. He felt sorry that with his death the secret of true love would be lost to mankind. But, being a modest young man, he attributed part of his achievement to her--to his beloved. The love of N+1 was as strong as death, as a certain writer put it. It was the love of life, he thought. He thought it was the only love he could ever have. He was the one who made it real.. Max knew that there never were, and that thereNever would be such women. In this respect, he had no special peculiarities, just as Adam did not have them. Beginning with Grandmother Eve and ending with the woman upon whom your eyes were directed--before you read these lines--the same inscription is to be clearly and distinctly read on the face of every woman at a certain time. The difference is only in the quality of the ink. Not that she was perfection itself, but she came very close to it, as close as an ideal can come to reality. Max rubbed his eyes, looked first from a distance, then from all sides; but the fact was undeniable--the inscription was fading. Max was convinced that the inscription had disappeared not of itself, but that some one had wiped it off. He went to his friend, John N. exactly at the moment when he was wiping away that inscription by his kisses. It was then that the records of the local occurrences were enriched by another unfortunate incident, entitled ""An Attempt at Suicide."" It is said that death always comes in due time. It is also said that life is a series of events that lead up to the final.. ""Max"" was a man with a stomach, a will, and a mind, but his soul was dead, or, to be more exact, it was absorbed in lethargic sleep. He ate, drank, walked, borrowed money and did not return it, and altogether he showed by a series of psycho-physiological acts that he was a living being. ""A fair piece of Max's soul, the part which contained his love for woman and for his friends, was dead"" But what remained was, nevertheless, enough for life. ""That was love for and faith in mankind"" ""I do not know what space of time had elapsed"". The evil of the world, he believed, lay in the evil will and in the madness of the people. They themselves were to blame for being unhappy, and they could be happy if they wished. This seemed so clear and simple that Max was dumfounded in his amazement at human stupidity. Humanity reminded him of a crowd huddled together in a spacious temple and panic-stricken at the cry of ""Fire!"" Instead of passing calmly through the wide doors and saving themselves, the maddened people, with the cruelty of frenzied beasts, cry and roar.. Max began to utter his word of wisdom. How he uttered it you will learn later. It is enough sometimes when one sensible, firm word is uttered to this crowd--the crowd calms down and imminent death is thus averted. Let, then, a hundred calm, rational voices be raised to mankind, showing them where to escape and where the danger lies--and heaven will be established on earth, if not immediately, then at least within a very brief time. The name of Max was mentioned in the newspapers, shouted in the market places, blessed and cursed; whole books were written on what Max N+1 had done.. The earth continued to turn light-mindedly around the sun, now coming nearer to it, now retreating. Max's nerves were shattered; his wavy locks became thin and his head began to look like that of Elijah the Prophet. He felt a piercing pain, as if he were trying to distinguish between day and night. He had calmed the crowd by his words of wisdom many a time before and had saved them from mutual destruction, but now he was not understood.. Max was alive, as was positively established by medical experts, who had made a series of simple tests. They thought that it was he who had shouted ""Fire!"" With all the eloquence of which he was capable he assured them that he was exerting all his efforts for their sake alone. They would not trust him. His soul was dead--as much as the soul can be dead while the body is alive. To Max all that he had loved and believed in was dead. There were neither feelings in it, nor desires, nor thoughts. The sad incident ended for Max in a new intermission. He was never the same again.. Max woke from a prolonged sleep to find he was once more in possession of all his five senses. He was alone in a room which might in justice be called either a room or a chimney. The walls were straight, white, smooth, with no openings, except one through which food was brought to Max. There was no furniture in the room, and Max had to lie on the stone floor. He lay curled together, as the narrowness of the room did not permit him to stretch himself. Max would not leave this room until the day of his death. He would not know now what darkness was. And there was not a more unhappy man in the world than Max, if he was a man.. Max did not know whether time was moving or whether it stood motionless. The same even, white light poured down on him. Only by the beating of his heart Max could judge that Chronos had not left his chariot. His body was aching ever more from the unnatural position in which it lay. The constant light and silence were growing ever more tormenting. In that darkness his love and faith were buried. He saw within himself impenetrable, heavy. Max made an effort to recall and to picture to himself what there is in life; human faces, voices, the stars. He knew that his eyes would never in life see that again. He could have destroyed himself, for there is no position in which a man can not do that. Instead Max worried about his health, trying to eat, although he had no appetite. He struggled against death as if it were not his deliverer, but his enemy; and as if life were to him not the worst of infernal tortures--but love, faith, and happiness. Tell me, John N.., where did he get the strength for that?"
0.38,0.48,33.68200836820084,"On that terrible day, when the universal injustice was committed and Jesus Christ was crucified in Golgotha among robbers, a tradesman of Jerusalem suffered from an unendurable toothache. His toothache had commenced on the day before, toward evening; at first his right jaw started to pain him, and one tooth, the one right next the wisdom tooth, seemed to have risen. Ben-Tovit's entire mouth and his head were filled with terrible sensations of pain, as though he had been forced to chew thousands of sharp, red-hot nails. He took some water into his mouth from an earthen jug, and for a minute the acuteness of the pain subsided. But five minutes later his toothache began to rage more severely than ever.. Ben-Tovit was a good and kind man, who hated any injustice. He complained that he was left alone, like a jackal, to groan and writhe for pain. His wife brought him numerous good remedies: rats' litter to be applied to his cheek.. Ben-Tovit suffered from severe pain for several days. He was tied up with a kerchief like that of a woman. He kept pacing back and forth on the flat roof of his house from one corner to the other, feeling ashamed to come close to the side facing the street. He dreamed of the little donkey, and when he felt worse. Ben-Tovit was angry at a crowd of children who were standing around him. His wife told him: ""Look, they are leading robbers there. Perhaps that will divert you"" He walked over to the parapet unwillingly. Bending his head on one side, closing one eye, and supporting his cheek with his hand, his face assumed a squeamish,. Ben-Tovit saw the criminals bending down under the weight of their crosses. Over them the scourges of the Roman soldiers were wriggling about like black snakes. One of the men, he of the long light hair, in a torn blood-stained cloak, stumbled over a stone.. Ben-Tovit's wife threw a cobblestone near the place where Jesus, lifted by the whips, was moving slowly. This intensified his toothache, and he shook his muffled head frequently, and roared: ""Moo-Moo...."" The spectacle had diverted him slightly, and after. Ben-Tovit told Samuel in detail how he had felt a pain in his right jaw on the day before, and how he awoke at night with a terrible toothache. To illustrate it he made a martyr's face, closing his eyes, shook his head, and groaned while the grey-bearded Samuel nodded his head compassionately and said: ""Oh, how painful it must have. The sun, which was destined to shine upon the world on that terrible day, had already set beyond the distant hills. In the west a narrow, purple-red strip was burning, like a stain of blood. The crosses stood out darkly but vaguely against this background. At the foot of the middle cross white kneeling figures were seen indistinctly."

He knew well and remembered only one star -- the green, bright and very attentive star that rises in the pale sky just before you go to bed. His name was Yura and he was a little boy from the village of Yura. He was a very clever boy, but he was also a very shy one. He would often hide in the shadows of the trees and hide from the world. He had a very dark secret, but now he has told it to you.. When he went with his mother to the centre of the city along the large streets, he remembered best of all, the wide, flat stones upon which his steps and his feet seemed terribly small. And even the multitude of revolving wheels and horses' heads did not impress themselves so clearly upon his memory as this new and unusually interesting appearance of the ground. And in falling asleep, as the last bright image of the passing day, he took along to his dreams a bit of hot, rubbed off stone bathed in sunshine or. The boy knew many people, large and small, but he knew and appreciated better the little ones with whom he could speak of everything. According to his measures, various objects seemed to him as follows: His father was ten yards tall, his mother three yards, the neighbour's angry dog thirty yards, their house a mile tall, the city a million miles away, the trees in their garden infinitely tall. The grown people behaved so foolishly and asked such absurd, dull questions about things that everybody knew, that it was necessary for him also to make believe. The author's father and mother were extraordinary persons, at once big and small, wise and foolish. He could say with certainty that his father was very great, terribly wise, that he possessed immense power, which made him a person to be feared somewhat. His mother was not so large, and sometimes she was even very small; she was very kind hearted, she kissed tenderly. Only with her could he relieve his heart when he grew tired of life, of his games or when he was the victim of some cruel injustice. The author's parents were charming and unlike other people, he says.. Yura's tears had an unusually pleasant taste in mother's presence. He feared that she might be taken away. He felt like stationing himself between him and mamma. No matter where he went to attend to his own affairs, something was drawing him back. He could find neither in his games nor in laughter, nor even in the reading of the most terrible fairy tales. He wanted to go away, but he was afraid to leave his mother's side. He was afraid she would say, ""Why are you forever staying around here? Go and play in your own room."" He was so afraid that he went away, and never returned.. Yurochka felt worst of all when a dangerous and suspicious guest would come when Yura had to go to bed. Yura felt vaguely but very strongly that he was replacing father in some way. And that made him somewhat like a grown man--he was in a bad frame of mind, but, therefore, he was unusually calculating, wise and serious. But when he lay down in his bed a sense of easiness came over him and he felt as though all was ended; the lights went out, life stopped; everything slept. He would take a book along or he would sit down to draw, but that did not. Yura was a boy who fulfilled his duty to the end. At times father could not understand him and would simply send him away to play or to sleep. Yura never felt offended and went away with a feeling of great satisfaction. He did not feel the need of being understood; he even feared it. He had noticed that these extraordinary and charming people, father and mother, were sometimes unhappy and were hiding this from everybody. Therefore he was also concealing his discovery, and gave everybody the impression that all was well. He would make believe that he was absent minded, that he heard nothing. But he heard and understood.. ""What are they saying?"" he asked his nurse in the middle of the night. ""Sleep, sleep,"" the nurse replied. ""What are you saying?"" ""I want to know what they are saying,"" he said. "" sleep, sleep"" ""Sleep,"" she said. 'Sleep,Sleep' ""Sleep"" "" sleep"". Yura pretended that he believed them and it seemed that he really did believe them. But that same evening, and perhaps it was another evening, he noticed his father crying. He was passing his father's study, and the door was half open; he heard a noise and he looked in quietly--father lay face downward upon his couch and cried aloud. Yura went away, turned about in his room and came back--the door was still half open, no one but father was in the room, and he was still sobbing. They are not saying anything."" Yura said.. Yura's father was crying. If he cried quietly, Yura could understand it, but he sobbed loudly, he moaned in a heavy voice and his teeth were gnashing terribly. He lay there, covering the entire couch, hiding his head under his broad shoulders, sniffing heavily--and that was beyond his understanding. On the table, on the large table covered with pencils, papers and a wealth of other things, stood the lamp burning with a red flame, and smoking--a flat, greyish black strip of smoke was coming out and bending in all directions. Yura walked away quietly.. Yura must love so that father should not notice it, and he must give the impression that it is very jolly to live on earth. Father did not notice that he loved him in a special manner. The threads of his soul stretched themselves to all--to the sun, to the knife and the cane he was peeling. It was hard for him to separate himself from all that was not himself. When the grass had a strong and fragrant odour it seemed to him that it was he who had such a fragrant scent. When he lay down in his bed, however strange it may seem, together with him in his little bed lay down the enormous yard, the street, the slant threads of the rain and the muddy pools and the whole, enormous. If he placed a stick somewhere in the garden in the evening it was there also in the morning. The knuckle-bones which he hid in a box in the barn remained there. Because of this he felt a natural need for hiding under his pillow all that was most valuable to him. Since things stood or lay there alone, they might also disappear of their accord, he reasoned. And in general it was so wonderful and pleasant that the nurse and the house and the sun existed not only yesterday, but every day; he felt like laughing and singing aloud when he awoke. He was called Yura Mikhailovich Pushkarev.. Yura got up when all were still sleeping. He dressed himself and jumped out quickly with the expectation of miracles. But he was unpleasantly surprised--the rooms were in the same disorder as usual. The paths were not swept and there was not a single lantern there. Yura grew very uneasy. He feared for the fate of the festival. He was very worried. He had to go back to his room and get some sleep. But when he got back he found the rooms were still the same. The cook and the chambermaid were still asleep.. Yura was washing the carriage behind the barn in the back yard. Yura clearly felt something of the holiday in the decisive way in which the coachman splashed the water from the bucket with his sinewy arms. Yevmen only glanced askance at Yura, and suddenly Yura seemed to have noticed for the first time his broad, black, wavy beard. He said: ""Good morning, Yevman."" The events, starting simultaneously in different places, rushed with such mad swiftness that it was impossible to catch up with them. The story of Yura and Yev men is told in the novel ""Yevmen and Yura"". Yura succeeded in concentrating himself for some time with the greatest difficulty. Together with father he was hanging up the lanterns. And father was charming; he laughed, jested, put Yura on the ladder. They both fell down together with the ladder upon the grass, but they were not hurt. Yura jumped up, while father remained lying on the grass,. hands thrown back under his head, looking with half-closed eyes at the shining, infinite azure of the sky. Yevmen, the coachman, harnessed the horse and drove out of the yard with a certain special, mysterious mission. The coachman said: ""Yura, Yura, I am going to take you. Yura recalled something unpleasant; but to cheer his father up he sat down astride upon his knees and said: ""Do you remember, father, when I was a little boy I used to sit down on your knees and you used to shake me like a horse?"" But before he had time to finish he lay with his nose on the grass; he was lifted in the air and thrown down with force--father had thrown him high up with his knees, according to his old habit. Yura felt offended; but father, entirely ignoring his anger, began to tickle him under his armpits, so that Yura had to laugh against his will. Yura was a young boy who was invited to a birthday party. He was so exhausted that he suddenly started to despise life. He fell asleep in his bed face downward in order to have his revenge on the nurse. But he fell asleep immediately, and was never seen again. The story was told by Yura's father, who was also called Yura, in a book called ""Yura's Story"" The book was written by Yurin and published in 18th century Japan. ""The musicians have arrived!"" he cried, looking for father or mother, or for any one who would treat the arrival of the musicians with proper seriousness. Father and mother were sitting in the garden--in the arbour which was thickly surrounded with wild grapes--maintaining silence. Although father embraced her, he seemed very serious. Both treated their arrival with inexplicable indifference, which called forth a feeling of sadness in Yura. But mamma stirred and said: ""Let me go"" ""I am going to go,"" he said. ""I will go."" ""You are going to leave me alone."" ""I'm going to take you away from here"" ""You're going to make me go away from you"". ""Remember,"" said father, referring to something Yura did not understand but which resounded in his heart with a light, gnawing alarm. ""Aren't you ashamed?"" mother laughed, and this laughter made Yura feel still more alarmed, especially since father did not laugh but maintained the same serious and mournful appearance of Gulliver pining for his native land. But soon all this was forgotten, for the wonderful festival had begun in all its glory, mystery and grandeur. Voices resounded, and laughter and merry jests, and the music. Yura Mikhailovich met the first guests at the front entrance. He made the acquaintance and even the friendship of some of them on the way from the corridor to the table. Yura felt vexed because the stupid Mitenka instead of carrying his sword, as he always did, placed it in a corner in the hallway as a cane. But even in the corner the sword stood out alone-- one could see at once that it was a sword. Another officer came with Mitenkas, an officer whom Yura knew and whose name was also Yura Mikhailovic. He thought that the officer must have been named so for fun.. The real Yura Mikhailovich had visited them several times; he even came once on horseback. But most of the time he came just before little Yura had to go to bed. Little Yura felt alarmed and sad; he was afraid that mamma might be deceived. He paid no attention to the real Yuras Mikhailovich: and now, walking beside Mitenka, he did not seem to realise his guilt; he adjusted his moustaches and maintained silence. He kissed mammma's hand, and that seemed repulsive to little Yuras. But the stupidMitenka also kissed m Mamma'shand, and thereby set everything aright.. Yura was playing with the ladies when he was thrown to the ground. He hurt his left leg near the knee very painfully. But he did not cry, and somehow his pain had quickly disappeared somewhere. Yurochka then began to squeal for joy and to run around. If he had a bell as large as the whole city he would have rung that bell. But as he had no such bell he climbed the linden tree, which stood near the terrace, and began to show off. He then fell to his knees and wept, but he was soon up and running again. He said: ""I am so happy, I am so glad, I have been so happy!"". Yura stood in front of the orchestra, spreading his legs apart and, according to his old but long forgotten habit, put his finger into his mouth. The sounds seemed to strike at him all at once; they roared and thundered; they made his legs tingle, and they shook his jaw. They played so loudly that there was nothing but the orchestra on the whole earth--everything else had vanished. Yura grew sad. The music was still roaring, but now it was somewhere far away, while within him all became quiet, and it was growing ever more and more quiet. Heaving a deep sigh, Yura looked at the sky--it was so high.. He wanted to see how the tables for card playing would be arranged, but the tables were ready and people had been playing cards for a long time when he came up. He touched the chalk and the brush near his father and his father immediately chased him away. And everywhere he turned out to be too late; he wanted to See how they would start to dance and he was sure that they would dance in the parlour, but they had already commenced to dance under the linden trees. And now it lay everywhere. It crawled into the bushes; it covered the entire garden with darkness, as with water, and it cover the sky. Everything looked as beautiful as the very best fairy tale.. Yura's heart yearned for the fusion of life and death. The great mystery of the night became his mystery. The people and the festival and the lanterns remained on earth, while he soared away, transformed into air, melting in the night like a grain of dust. That was Yura's second madness that evening--he became invisible. He became invisible, and his little heartyearned for still more mystery. He was transformed into a grain-of-dust. He had become a fairy tale. He could not be seen. He couldn't be heard. His voice was not heard. But the officers and the students could be seen even in the dark--a white spot.. ""He watched Ninochka for a long time until he learned all her life--he was almost trapped,"" says the author. ""He passed the room where they were playing cards, also as an invisible being, holding his breath and stepping so lightly, as though he were soaring in the air,"" he says. ""Only when he reached the garden, in the dark, he drew a proper breath. Then he resumed his quest"" ""He came over to people who were talking so near him that he could touch them with his hand, and yet they did not know that he was there, and they continued to speak undisturbed,"" he adds. ""he was nearly trapped. He was almost caught. He watched Ninoshenko for a time until. Yurochka hid behind a bush and held his breath. Ninochka even exclaimed: ""YuroChka, is that you?"" Yura crawled toward a mysterious, faintly blinking light. He was alone. There was a breath of cold from the dewy grass. The gooseberry bush scratched him. The darkness could not be pierced with his eyes, and there was no end to it. O Lord! O Lord, help me to escape! He was afraid--it was impossible; all was lost. And the music was still playing, and everybody had forgotten him, even mamma. He had gone so far that he was seized with dread--between him and the past, when he was walking like everybody else. Yura Mikhailovich was sitting in the same arbour with his mother and father. The lights of the lanterns everywhere had gone out, and only two were still burning. The right Yura grew petrified in his place; his heart stood still; and his breathing ceased. He was about to get up to go into the arbour and there begin life anew, when suddenly he heard voices in theArbour. His mother and the wrong Yuraikhailovich, the officer, were talking. Yura said: ""Stop. You have lost your mind! Somebody may come in here."". Yura Mikhailovich said: ""He does not know anything. Is it possible that he does notknow anything?"" Mamma said: ""Of course he does! Of course!"" Yurochka understood that they were talking of him, but what did it all mean, O Lord? And why did she laugh? The officer embraced and kissed mamma. They became silent. YuroChka looked through the leaves and saw that. Yura heard a man scolding his father for something, brandishing the chalk. He covered his mouth with both hands, one upon the other, and thus remained until the officer and mamma went out of the arbour. Then they spoke of something, but he understood nothing; he heard nothing. And he even forgot the words which he knew and used before. He remembered but one word, ""Mamma,"" and he whispered it uninterruptedly with his dry lips. But that word sounded so terrible, more terrible than anything. And in order not to exclaim it against his will, Yura covered his mouths with his hands.. Yura was seized with a whirlwind of frantic tears, of desperate sobs and mortal anguish. He looked at his father to see whether he had guessed it, and when mother came in he started to shout louder in order to divert any suspicion. Some one laughed; some one shouted. Father caught Yura in his arms, pressed him closely, causing him pain, and cried: ""Where is mother? Call mother."" Then Yura ran over to the bald-headed old man and began to beat him with his fists with all his strength. The old man was a little fellow, while father was big, handsome and tall, and his smile was sad.. Yura was frightened by father's whist. Father carried him into his room. Yura demanded that father himself undress him. ""Now, you are getting cranky,"" said father. ""Yura, oh, what a dear boy!"" said mamma. ""Just think of the boy!"" he said. ""Oh, my dearest! Oh, mydearest!"" ""Yurah!"" said Yura, ""yurah"". Yura held father by the hand and said: ""I don't know how to do it; let mamma undress you."" Mamma had deft fingers and she undressed him quickly, and while she was removing his clothes Yura ordered the nurse out of the room. As father was beginning to grow angry, and he might guess what had happened in the arbour, decided to let him go. But while kissing him he said cunningly: ""He will not scold you any more, will. Mamma sat as though she were all alone, as though Yura, her son, who was falling asleep, was not there at all--she folded her hands in her lap and looked into the distance. To attract her attention Yura stirred, but mamma said briefly: ""Sleep."" And she continued to look into thedistance. And she said: ""We have guests! We can't leave them that way."" But father looked at her steadfastly, and shrugged his shoulders.. Yura's eyes had grown heavy and he was falling asleep with all his sorrow and his tears, mamma suddenly went down on her knees before the little bed and kissed"

He could not supinely tolerate evil, and so found means to avenge himself on life. He thrashed his companions, was rude to the Head, impertinent to the masters. He told lies all day long to his teachers and to his mother. But to his father only he never lied.. Sashka was expelled from school after he bit his mother's finger. He would then howl so loudly that all who heard him were fain to stop their ears. When he had howled as long as thought advisable, he would suddenly cease, and, putting out his tongue, draw in his copy-book a caricature of himself howling.. Sashka lived on bread and potatoes his father secreted for him. He left off washing in the morning, ran about all day bullying the other boys. He had but one fear, and that was hunger, for his mother entirely left off providing for him, so that he came to depend upon the pieces of bread and potato which his fatherSecreted for Him.. Sashka recognized the familiar smell of vodka. His mother scratched her head with the short dirty nail of her thick fore-finger. She merely spat, and cried: ""Statisticians! that's what they are!"" Sashka shuffled contemptuously, and. The Svetchnikovs were rich people, who had put him to the grammar school, and after his expulsion had forbidden him their house. The housemaid came,"" he whispered. ""Get along with you!"" said Sashka with incredul. Ivan Savvich had been used to drink heavily, and then his wife had feared and hated him. But when he had begun to develop unmistakable signs of consumption, and could drink no longer, she took to drink in her turn, and gradually accustomed herself to vodka.. Feoktista Petrovna avenged herself for all she had suffered at the hands of that tall narrow-chested man. Now she said what she pleased, brought men and women to the house just as she chose, and sang with them noisy songs. He lay silent behind the partition huddled together with perpetual cold, and meditating on the injustice of human life.. ""Perhaps you might bring something for me too from the Christmas tree,"" he said to his son. ""All right!"" he blurted out, ""give me my jacket"" He was taken to the police station, where he was charged with drunk driving. He was released, but his son continued to drink, and was eventually arrested.. Sashka was bullying the youngest of the Svetchnikovs, Kolya. The boy had a finger stuck in the corner of his pouting mouth. ""Are 'oo weally a naughty boy?"" he inquired of Sashka. ""Miss said 'oo was,"" replied Sashki.. Sashka's father used to give lessons to the lady of the house. Kolya's blue eyes opened wider than ever, and filled with tears. Transferring his finger from his mouth to his reddening nose he blinked his long eyelashes and whispered: ""Bad—bad boy!"". Sashka knew that his miserable father had loved her, and that she had married another. He could not bring himself to forgive what seemed to him like treachery. ""Bow, Sashka, you should not. Sashka was asked if he wanted to go to a technical school. Sashka replied: ""Not likely!"" He then said: ""Well,. Sashka put out his tongue and quickly drew it back again, so that Sofia Dmitrievna did not notice anything. The old gentleman showed an amount of irascibility that she could not understand. ""I don't know whether there will be a vacancy,"" dryly remarked the old man avoiding looking at Sashka, and smoothing down the ridge of. The children filed into the brightly-lit room in orderly pairs, and quietly walked round the glittering tree. For a minute there reigned the silence of profound delight, which all at once broke out into a delighted exclamation. One of the little girls, unable to restrain her delight, kept dancing up and down in the same place, her blue ribbon beating against her shoulders.. Sashka sat down behind the piano, and crumpled to pieces in his pocket the last of the cigarettes. He tried to recall to his imagination his little penknife, which he had acquired by a swap not long ago, and was very fond of. But his knife all at once seemed to him a very poor affair with its ground-down blade.. Kolya saw a little angel in wax carelessly hung in the thickest of the dark boughs. His transparent dragon-fly wings trembled in the light, and he seemed altogether alive and ready to fly away. But there was something here that was wanting in Kolya's face, and in all other faces and things.. Sashka was not conscious of the force of the mysterious influence which attracted him towards the little angel. He felt that he had known him all his life, and had always loved him, loved him more than his penknife. Filled with doubt, alarm, and a delight which he could not comprehend, Sashka clasped his hands to. Sashka avoided looking at the little angel, lest he should direct the attention of others towards him. He clasped his hands behind his back, and in full readiness to fight to the death to win the little Angel, he walked to and fro with cautious, stealthy steps. The hostess appeared in the doorway.. ""Auntie—auntie, do give me one thing from the tree; give me the little angel,"" demanded Sashka. ""Impossible,"" replied the lady in a tone of indifference. ""We are going to keep the tree decorated till the New Year,"" she said. ""It's rude."". Sashka was reminded of a boy who had asked his master to mark him 3. He plucked at the lady's dress again and dropped on to his knees. He folded his hands as described above.. Sashka looked at her with dislike, and rudely repeated: ""Give me the little angel"" The hostess answered hurriedly: ""Well, then, I'll give it to you. Ah! what a stupid you are! I will give you what you. ""Beautiful thing!"" said the lady, who was sorry to part with such a dainty and presumably expensive toy. ""Who can have hung it there?"" asked Sashka. ""Are you not too big to know what to do with it? Look, there are some picture-books"". The lady of the grey hair feared nothing so much as a scene, so she slowly held out the little angel to Sashka. ""There now, take it!"" she said in a displeased tone; ""what a persistent boy you are!"" Slowly drawing thelittle angel to his. Sashka felt something so blissful, so bright, the like of which had never before been experienced in this sorrowful, sinful, suffering world. The child who had outgrown his clothes, and the lineaments of the little angel, which had been spiritualised by the hand of an unknown artist.. Sashka held the little angel at a distance from his father, so as not to allow him to touch it. Crouching like a panther preparing to spring, Sashka surveyed the surrounding company, on the look-out for some one who should dare wrest his little angel from him. His mother was asleep worn out with a whole day's. The father withdrew his hand, and with troubled eyes studied the details of the little angel. Sashka whispered with the air of a pedagogue: ""Father, what a bad habit you have of touching everything! You might break it."" The father's eyes unblinkingly regarded the little Angel. Under his steadfast gaze it seemed to grow larger and brighter.. The little toy was so beautiful, this was why there was in it something specially attractive, which defied description. With the smell of wax, which emanated from the toy, was mingled a subtle aroma, and it seemed to the broken man that her dear fingers touched the angel, those fingers which he would fain. On a level with the eyes of the man, who had lived his life, sparkled the eyes. The thoughts of Sashka were formless, nebulous, but all the more deeply for that did they move his agitated soul. For them present and future. The father and son did not look at one another: their sick hearts grieved, wept, and rejoiced apart. But there was a something in their thoughts which fused their hearts in one, and annihil. The father with an unconscious motion put his arm around the neck of his son, and the son's head rested equally without conscious volition upon his father's consumptive chest. ""She it was who gave it to thee, was it not?"" whispered the father, without taking his eyes off the little angel. ""Who else? of course she did,"". Sashka felt his father's arm tremble as it lay upon his neck. Sashka sternly puckered his brow, and cautiously—so as not to disturb the heavy trembling arm—wiped away a tear from his eyes. So strange was it to see a big old man crying, Sashkas thought.. Sashka's father asked him to undress. But before doing so the little angel must be disposed of for the night. He was hung up by his string, which was fastened to the flue of the stove. There it stood out accurately delineated against the white Dutch-tiles. And so they could both see him, Sashka and his father.. The little angel seemed to stir. Over his rosy fingers there rolled thick drops which fell upon the bench. To the smell of kerosene was added the stifling scent of melting wax. And gentle sleep and restfulness lay upon the. The little angel gave a tremble as though on the point of flight, and—fell with a soft thud upon the hot flags. This is, of course, only a child's way of addressing"
0.44,0.54,38.31775700934579,"""I felt it for the first time as we were marching along the road,"" he writes. ""The sun was so enormous, so fiery and terrible, that it seemed as if the earth had drawn nearer to it and would soon be burnt up altogether in its merciless rays"" ""The small shrunk pupil, as small as a poppy-seed, sought in vain for darkness under the closed eyelid"". ""I walked along with my eyes shut, hearing the multitude moving around me. But I heard no word. All were silent, as if an army of dumb people were moving"" ""I stumbled and fell several times and then involuntarily opened my eyes, and all that I saw seemed a wild fiction, the terrible raving of a mad world"". The enormous, near, terrible sun lit up thousands of tiny blinding suns on every gun-barrel and metal plate, and these suns, as fiery-white and sharp as the white-hot points of the bayonets, crept into your eyes from every side.. ""I suddenly remembered my home: a corner of my room, a scrap of light-blue wall-paper, and a dusty untouched water-bottle on my table"" ""I know that I stood still and lifted up my arms, but somebody gave me a push from behind, and I quickly moved on, thrusting the crowd aside, and hastening whither I knew not"". ""I clearly perceived that all these people, marching silently on in the glaring sun, torpid from fatigue and heat, swaying and falling—that they were all mad. They did not know whither they were going, they did notknow what that sun was for, they didn't know anything"" ""It was not heads that they had on their shoulders, but strange and terrible globes"". An hour passed as I sat on that stone, but the multitude still moved on past me, and the air and earth and the distant phantom-like ranks trembled as before. Suddenly a horse's head appeared above the throng with bloodshot and senseless eyes and a wide-open grinning mouth, that only hinted at a terrible unearthly cry. This head appeared, fell down, and for an instant the crowd stopped, growing denser in that spot. I could hear hoarse. Not far from me someone was lying with his bared back upturned. I wanted to move away from him, but I had not the strength, and, tottering from weakness, I continued looking at the endless phantom-like swaying files of men. I saw a soldier part from the crowd and direct his steps in a decided manner towards us. For an instant I lost sight of him in a ditch, but when he reappeared and moved on towards us, his gait was unsteady. ""What is the matter? You had better sit down,"" I said. But he continued standing, vainly trying to gather himself together, and stared at me in silence. Involuntarily I got up from the stone and, tottering looked into his eyes—and saw an abyss of horror and insanity in them"" ""What a sea of fire he must have seen through those enormous black windows! Maybe I had only imagined it, maybe in his look there was only death—but, no"". ""Go away!"" I cried falling back. And as if he was only waiting for a word, enormous, disorderly and mute as before, he suddenly fell down upon me, knocking me over. I was not mistaken—in those black, bottomless pupils, surrounded by a narrow orange-colored rim, like a bird's eye, there was more than death, more than the horror of death. With a shudder I freed my legs from under. ""For three days and nights a Satanic roar and howl enveloped us in a cloud of insanity, isolated us from the earth, the sky and ourselves,"" he writes. ""We, the living, wandered about like lunatics. The dead—they lay still, while we moved about doing our duty, talking and laughing, and we were—like lunatics"" ""If you had suddenly asked any one of us who we were, undoubtedly we should not have been. The battle was like a dream, he writes. All faces seemed familiar, and all that was going on seemed quite familiar and natural. But when I looked closely at any face or gun, or began listening to the din, I was struck by the novelty and endless mystery of everything. Night approached imperceptibly, and before we had time to notice it and wonder where it had come from, the sun was again burning above our heads.. The author sat in her room and contemplated the picture for a long time. She wondered why her son was not asleep, for it was night and time for him to go to bed. She examined the wall-paper: every spiral, silvery flower, square and line. She never imagined that she knew her room so well.. Once a shell burst not far from me, making my legs give a jerk, and somebody cried out loudly, louder than the bursting of the shell, and I said to myself: ""Somebody is killed"" But I did not get up and did not tear my eyes away from the light-blue wall-paper and the water-bottle.. The rain fell so suddenly that the men stopped firing and sought shelter. The sound of the drops splashing on the stones and guns seemed to tear the bloody, savage nightmare asunder for an instant. When I glanced at the wet, glistening gun it unexpectedly reminded me of something dear and peaceful—my childhood, or perhaps my first love. The rain was so sudden and out of place, and we were so afraid of getting wet, that we left our guns, stopped. The author was in the trenches during the Second World War. He recalls a young volunteer telling him that the general wanted us to retain our position for only two hours more, when we should be relieved. He became interested in the young man's face, probably because of its unusual and striking pallor. Even the dead have more colour than that young, beardless face had, he writes.. ""Are you afraid?"" I asked, touching his elbow. But his elbow seemed as if made of wood, and he only smiled and remained silent. ""I felt a draught of warm air upon my right cheek that made me sway,"" he said. ""Before my eyes, in place of the white face, there was something short, blunt and red, and out of it the blood was gushing as out of an uncorked bottle"". They say there are a great number of madmen in our army as well as in the enemy's. Four lunatic wards have been opened. I had been searching for it, and I had found it—that red laugh. Now I understood what there was in all those mutilated, torn, strange bodies. It was a red laugh! It was in the sky, it was in. He told me that no less than two thousand men were lost at that one wire entanglement. While they were hacking at the wire and getting entangled in its serpentine coils, they were pelted by an incessant rain of balls and grapeshot. He assured me it was very terrifying, and if only they had known in which direction to run. But ten or twelve continuous lines of wire and the struggle with it, a whole labyrinth of pitfalls with stakes driven in at the bottom, had muddled them. Many seemed as if they were intoxicated, and ran straight at the wire, got caught in it, and remained shrieking, until a bullet finished them. He himself, although he had had nothing to eat or drink since the morning, felt very queer. His head swam, and there were moments when the feeling of terror in him changed to wild rapture, and from rapture again to terror. When somebody struck up a song at his side, he caught up the tune, and soon a whole unanimous chorus broke forth.. The very sky seemed to be red, and one could have thought that a catastrophe had overwhelmed the universe. At least the movements of those three resembled dancing. He remembers distinctly, when he was shot through the chest and fell, his legs twitched for some time.. ""It would not be half so bad, old boy, to get a medal for bravery,"" he said. He was lying on his back with a waxen face, sharp nose, prominent cheek-bones and sunken eyes. Mortification had already set in; he had a high temperature, and in three days' time he was to be thrown into the grave.. ""What does it all mean, ay?"" asked he in a frightened and persistent manner, pulling at my hand. ""Is it possible to make her understand, what my country means?"" he asked. ""The red laugh,"" answered I. ""Many have grown bald and grey. Look here, give me a looking-glass here."" ""There are no looking-glasses here."". ""I feel white hair growing out of my head. Give me a looking-glass!"" He became delirious, crying and shouting out, and I left the hospital"" ""We got a samovar, we even got a lemon and glasses, and established ourselves under a tree, as if we were at home, at a picnic"" ""In vain I looked for a familiar face in this group of disconcerted men—I could not find one"". ""These men, restless, hasty and jerky in their movements, starting at every sound, constantly looking for something behind their backs, trying to fill up that mysterious void into which they were too terrified to look, by superfluous gesticulations"" ""Their voices sounded different, articulating the words with difficulty in jerks, easily passing into angry shouts or senseless irrepressible laughter at. ""We all sat watching the samovar, but it went out, its sides reflecting the yellowishness and menace of the sunset, and it seemed also an unfamiliar, dead and incomprehensible object. Somebody sighed; somebody convulsively cracked his fingers; somebody laughed; somebody jumped up and began walking quickly round the table. These last days one could often meet with such men, who were always. ""Fatty-legs"" we called a fellow-officer, who, being short, wore enormous water-tight boots. Somebody asked, ""And where is. ""How is that, boys?"" sounded a gentle, hurt voice, full of distress and almost crying; ""why, I only came for the sake of the lemon"" Somebody said: ""To-morrow we begin the advance on the enemy."". ""I wonder what it's like at home now?"" asked he vaguely, and in his voice there sounded a guilty smile. The cloud lifted, and it seemed to grow lighter; the faces became more familiar, and he, who kept circling round us, grew calmer and sat down. ""At home? What home? Why, is there home anywhere? Don't interrupt me or else I shall fire. At home I used to take a bath every day—. ""I am like an animal, I despise myself, I cannot recognise myself and death is not at all terrifying. You tear my brain with your shrapnel-shots. Aim at what you will, all hit my brain—and you can speak of—home. What home? Streets, windows, people, but I would not go into the street now for anything."". The band played with frenzied mirth and defiance, hurriedly, discordantly, too loudly, and too joyously, and one could feel that those who were playing, and thosewho were listening, saw as we did, that same enormous, shapeless shadow, risen above the world. The abrupt and broken sound tossed about, jumping and running away from the others, quivering with horror and insanity in its lonesomeness.. The doctor roused me by pushing me cautiously. I was already asleep when he woke me. He held me firmly by the arm, excusing himself: ""I frightened you, forgive me. I know you want to sleep . . ."" I muttered, dozing off. I fell asleep and slept, as it seemed to me for a long time, when the doctor again began speaking, poking me cautiously in the ribs.. ""I have not slept for five days!"" the doctor said. ""I believe I'm beginning to have hallucinations. I keep thinking, that some of the wounded were left . . ."" The doctor was pale and tottering, and one could see that if he were only to lie down for an instant he would fall asleep and remain so without waking for several days running. So suddenly and unexpectedly appeared before us a row of black outlines—the engine and carriages. Near them, scarcely distinguishable in the darkness, some men. ""If you were to fire a volley from all the guns, nobody would stir. They are all asleep. One could go up and bind them all,"" said the sentry. ""Just as if you couldn't have taken somebody else,"" replied the doctor. ""Hush! please, hush!"" said the doctor, ""We are going in the train"". The train was moving slowly and cautiously, shaking slightly, as if groping its way. The carriages were jerking backwards and forwards, something was rattling. And gradually, because of all these sounds and because I was lying comfortably and quietly, sleep deserted me. But the doctor was sound asleep, and when I took him by the hand it was like the hand of a corpse, heavy and limp. ""You had better wake him, before he falls into a sound sleep, for then you won't be able to do anything with him. I know by myself"" ""It would be good to have a drop of vodka now,"" said the student acting as a hospital orderly."

0.6,0.7,49.84166080225194,"The Minister was a very fat man, predisposed to apoplexy, and as it was necessary therefore to spare him every dangerous emotion, the took the minutest precautions in warning him that a serious attempt upon his life had been planned. The attempt was to be made the next day, at the moment when His Excellency was to leave the house to go to make his report. A few terrorists, armed with revolvers and bombs, were to meet near. ""How do they know that I am to go to present my report at one o'clock in the afternoon, when I learned it myself only two days ago?"" asked the Minister. The commander of the body-guard made a vague gesture signifying ignorance. The Minister felt a sensation of agreeable excitement. It seemed to him that he had just received, or was about to receive, a great and unexpected reward. But the friends went away, and the lights were put out. The lights gleamed in this new residence.. Dignitary was afflicted with a kidney trouble. Every violent emotion caused his face, feet, and hands to swell. He felt his face puff up and become, as it were, something foreign to his body. His thought recurred obstinately to the cruel fate that his enemies were preparing for him. He evoked one after the other all the horrible attempts of recent date. It seemed to him that his diseased body was another man's body suffering from the fiery shock of the explosion. And, at these recollections, it seemed to he that his disease was another person's disease. He suffered the anguish of the sick as he felt his faces puff up.. ""Brave fellows! Brave fellows!"" he exclaimed in a loud and clear voice. But in vain did he stir about, lavish his praise, and smile at the discomfiture of the terrorists. It seemed to him that the death evoked for him by the anarchists, and which existed in their thought, was already there and would remain there, refusing to go away until the assassins should be seized, deprived of their bombs, and lodged safely in prison. ""Brave fellows"" were the words of a man who had been shot in the head by an anarchist.. ""At one o'clock in the afternoon, Your Excellency!"" This phrase came back to him continually, uttered in all tones, now joyously and ironically, now irritably, now obstinately and stupidly. There it stood, in the corner yonder, declining to leave, and unable to leave. Before it and after it no other hour existed; it alone; presumptuous and obsessing, was entitled to a special life. It had stepped out of the clock-dial, and was beginning to live a distinct life, stretching itself.. ""Ah!"" suddenly exclaimed the Minister aloud; slowly he removed his hands from his face. Gazing far before him into the darkness with a fixed and attentive look, he stretched out his hand to turn on the light. Then he arose, and in his bare feet walked around the strange chamber so unfamiliar to him; finding another light, he turned that on also. . . . And it is he, this good and thoughtful Swiss, with the blue eyes, and the open countenance, and. the numerous military decorations—he it is who opens the terrible door with his own hands.. The Minister resembled, those old people who are tormented by asthma and insomnia. Without dressing he threw, himself into an arm-chair, his eyes wandered to the ceiling. The room became bright and agreeable; there was only the disordered bed and the fallen coverlet to indicate a terror that had not yet completely disappeared. ""Evidently,"" he thought with lucidity, ""I am afraid now because I have been warned and because I know. But, if I had been left in ignorance, I should have taken my coffee quietly. And then, evidently, this death."". ""I have a kidney trouble; some day I must die of it, and yet I am not afraid, because I don't know when,"" he says. ""To die is not so terrible; the terrible thing is to know that one is going to die,"" he adds. ""It would be quite impossible for a man to live if he knew the hour and day of his death with absolute certainty,"" he writes. ""And yet these idiots warn me: 'At one o'clock in the afternoon, Your Excellency!'"". No man can know when he will die. Once, in his youth, it had happened to him to get beyond his depth; he had decided to put an end to his existence. He had loaded his revolver, written some letters, and even fixed the hour of his suicide. Then, at the last moment, he had reconsidered. He admitted that they would kill him some day or other, but it would not be the next day . . . it wouldn't be thenext day.. The Minister understood that he would know neither sleep, nor rest, nor joy, until this black and accursed hour, thus detached from the course of time, had passed. He feared the unexpected, the inevitable: an attack of apoplexy, a laceration of the heart, the rupture of a little artery suddenly made powerless to resist the flow of blood and splitting like a glove on swollen hands. The fear of death permeated his entire body, filtered into his bones, exuded from every pore of his body. He dared not look at his swollen fingers, full of some fatal fluid.. People came running. On every hand appeared these shadows: they arose in the corners and stretched out upon the ceiling, fastening upon all projections and running along the walls. It was difficult to understand where all these taciturn, monstrous, and innumerable shadows could have kept themselves before—mute souls of mute things. A thick and trembling voice said something indistinguishable. The voice was that of a man who had been in a dream. The man had been asleep in a sleeping house. He had been disturbed by an electric bell. The bell began to ring in a continuous and terrifying fashion.. Four terrorists, three men and one woman, carrying bombs, revolvers, and infernal machines, were taken in front of the steps of the Minister's residence. A fifth accomplice was arrested at her dwelling, where the implements had been manufactured and the conspiracy planned. All five were very young: the eldest of the men was twenty-eight, the younger of the women nineteen. They were tried in the fortress where they had been imprisoned after their arrest; they were tried quickly and secretly, as was the custom at that merciless epoch.. Three people, one woman and two men, gave their real names to the court. They refused to reveal their identities. They spoke as if they were speaking to a group of people. They were not speaking to each other, but to a larger group. They said they were interested in the work of the court, not the work itself. They had been asked to give their names, but they refused to give them. The court asked them to give names. They did not reveal their real identities.. Sergey Golovin looked at the sky, pulled at his mustache, winked now one and now the other of his eyes behind the long, heavy eyelashes, and reflected profoundly on nobody knows what. He twisted his thick blond beard, to which he had not yet become accustomed, and gazed steadily at the window, knitting his brows. The sky appeared to be covered with azure stains, of an ever-deepening blue, a blue pure and infinite. And because it did not strip itself suddenly, but modestly draped itself in the transparent veil of clouds, it became charming.. Golovin saw an unknown young girl, surnamed Musya. She was younger than Golovin, but seemed his elder because of the severity, the gravity, of her proud and loyal eyes. Musya was very pale, of that passionate pallor peculiar to those who burn with an inner, radiant, and powerful fire. The delicate neck and slender arms alone revealed that intangible something which is youth itself, and which sounded so distinctly in the pure harmonious voice that resembled a costly instrument in perfect tune. The young face resumed its naïve expression and sought again the sky of spring. It was the. Musya looked at the sky with calmness and indifference. She scarcely stirred; from time to time only, with a gesture that was hardly visible, she felt for a deep trace in the third finger of her right hand. Musya's neighbor, motionless also, with hands folded between his knees and somewhat of affectation in his pose, was an unknown surnamed Werner. He gave the impression of an immense and calm force, of a cold and audacious valor. If one can bolt a face as one bolts a heavy door, the unknown had bolted his as if it were a door of iron.. Werner was the leader of the prisoners, and was treated with a certain respect. The very politeness with which he uttered his clear and curt replies seemed dangerous on his lips. On the backs of the other prisoners the customary cloak seemed a ridiculous costume; on him it was not even noticeable, so foreign was the garment to the man. By a superhuman effort of the will he kept his fingers from trembling, and maintained the firmness and moderation of his voice and the tranquillity of his gaze. The judges looked upon him as the leader, and treated him with a Certain respect.. ""It's nothing, Vasya. It will soon be over!"" Tanya Kovalchuk, the fifth terrorist, sheltered her comrades with a maternal look. ""It was as difficult to determine his age as that of a rotting corpse. According to his papers he was only twenty-three. Once or twice Werner touched him gently on the knee, and each time he answered briefly: ""It'sNothing."" ""It will soonbe over!"" ""It is not a matter of life and death, it is only a matter for the future"". She was still very young; her cheeks seemed as highly colored as those of Sergey Golovin. She listened to her comrades simply to see if their voices trembled. She contented herself with cracking her plump fingers. At Musya and Werner she gazed with proud and respectful admiration. She continually tried to attract his attention by her smile. She could not look at Vasya; his anguish was too intense. She was full of tender anxiety and infinite love.. The trial ended toward eight o'clock, just as the day was drawing to its close. Little by little, in the eyes of Sergey and Musya, the blue sky disappeared. The sky grew dim gently as on a summer evening, becoming grayish, and suddenly cold and wintry. Gotovin heaved a sigh, stretched himself, and raised his eyes toward the window. He began to examine the judges, the soldiers, and their weapons, exchanging a smile with Tanya Kovalchuk. He then looked out the window, where the chilly darkness of the night was already making itself manifest.. Musya remained until the sentence had been pronounced. She did not lower her gaze to the ground, but directed it toward a corner where a spider's web was swaying gently in the invisible current of warm air from the stove. After the verdict, the condemned said their farewells to their lawyers, avoiding their disconcerted, pitying, and confused looks. Then they grouped themselves for a moment near the door, and exchanged short phrases. They said: ""It's nothing, Vasya! All will soon be over!"". Ivan Yanson had been hired as a farm-hand by a well-to-do farmer. He was a native of Wesenberg, in Esthonia. Yanson remained silent for almost two years. He said hardly a word to either man or beast. He led the horse to water and harnessed it without speaking to it, walking about it lazily, with short hesitating steps. He had very little knowledge of Russian. As there were none of his countrymen living in the neighborhood, and as his employer was a Russian. Yanson beat the horse cruelly with his enormous whip. Drink transformed his cold and wicked obstinacy into fury. The hissing of the lash and the regular and painful sound of his wooden shoes on the floor of the shed could be heard even at the farmhouse. To punish him for torturing the horse the farmer at first beat Yanson, but, not succeeding in correcting him, he gave it up. He came back to the farm on the gallop, a distance of seven mlles.. Yanson did not see the passers-by, he did not insult them, uphill and down he maintained his furious gait. Sometimes silent, with set teeth, impelled by a whirlwind of indescribable fury, suffering, and enthusiasm, he was like a blind man in his mad career. One day he received a letter written in Esthonian; but, as he didnot know how to read or write, he threw it into the muck-heap with savage indifference.. One night, in the village, the little church-bell began to ring in a feeble and lamentable way; flames appeared. Malefactors from nobody knew where were pillaging the neighboring farm. They killed the owner and his wife, and set fire to the house. This caused a feeling of anxiety on the farm where Yanson lived. He alone knew what the fields and telegraph-poles were saying. He listened also to the conversation of men, the stories of murder, pillage,. Ivan Yanson, who was afraid of a gun, committed robbery and murder, and made an attempt at rape. He stabbed his master several times in the back. He found the money; then, as if he had just seen the master's wife for the first time, he threw himself upon her to rape her, without the slightest premeditation. But he happened to drop his knife; and, as the woman was the stronger, she not only resisted Yanson but half strangled him. Yanson was later sentenced to life in prison, but was released on parole.. Yanson was tried and sentenced to death. He was found an hour later squatting in the corner of the shed, and scratching matches which continually went out. He had been trying to set fire to the farm. A few days later the farmer died. Yanson fled. He turned scarlet, and began to untie and tie his cravat, as if it were choking him. When the sentence of death by hanging was pronounced, Yanson suddenly showed emotion. He began to undo and tie the cravats. He then began to walk away.. Yanson waved his arms without knowing why, and declared to the presiding judge, who had read the sentence: ""She has said that I must be hanged"" Yanson pointed at the judge with his finger, and, looking at him furt. ""I must not be hanged!"" repeated Yanson, obstinately. ""Well, you are a famous imbecile,"" said the guard. ""Take away the accused,"" replied the guard, in violation of orders. ""I will not be taken away!"" said Yanson. ""You will not take me away."" ""I am not going to be taken to jail,"" said a guard, ""and you are not taking me to jail."" ""You are not a man. You are a man,"" replied Y Hanson.. ""And when will they bang me?"" asked Yanson, in a tone of incredulity. ""It is not a question of hanging a dog, which one takes behind a shed and dispatches with a single blow! Is that what you would like, imbecile?"" said the guard. ""Why, no, I would not like it!"" said Yanson suddenly with a joyous grimace. ""I would rather be hanged!"" said the prisoner.. Yanson was about to be hanged when he began to laugh. The guard looked at Yanson in astonishment, and then knitted his brows. The prison and all of life were a sort of mad-house in which he, the guard, was the chief madman, he said. Yanson's laughter insulted the prison, the gallows itself, and made them ridiculous, the old guard said.. Yanson laughed always. ""Why do you show your teeth? This is no wine-shop!"" replied the guard, crossing himself. ""And I, I do not want to be hanged! Ha! ha! ha!"" said Yanson. Yanson had long since forgotten his crime; sometimes he simply regretted that he had not succeeded in raping the woman. Soon he thought no more about the matter. He repeated the phrase: ""I must not be hanged,"" and so convincing, so irrefutable was it that hehad no occasion for anxiety.. Yanson had only one desire—to drink brandy and course madly over the roads with his horse at full gallop. He was well fed in prison, he took on flesh and became as big as his master's wife. One day, when Yanson put his customary question, the guard answered him abruptly, in an irritated voice: ""It will be soon. In a week, I think."" Yanson turned pale; the gaze of his glassy eyes became so thick that he seemed as if asleep.. Yanson lay on his camp-bed, but his eyes did not close; they remai. He took no notice of anything; his movements were made slowly"

He knew that he was thus estimated, and self-complacently appropriated the good opinion as clearly his due. The love of gain was strong in his mind, and ever ready to accede to new plans for adding dollar to dollar. But a disturbing perception of something wrong restrained him.. ""Twenty yards at fifty-five cents! Just eleven dollars."" The customer opened her purse as she spoke, and counted out the sum in glittering gold dollars. ""Send the bundle to No. 300 Argyle Street,"" said the lady, with a bland smile, as she turned from the counter, and the half-bewildered store. A single dollar on the conscience may press so heavily as to bear down a man's spirits, and rob him of all the delights of life. Vain was it that Mr. Levering sought self-justification. He found it impossible to escape the smarting conviction that he had unjustly exacted a dollar from one of his customers. Many times through the day he found himself in a musing, abstracted state.. The dollar was on his conscience, and he sought in vain to remove it by efforts of this kind. ""Very foolish to worry myself about a trifle like this,"" he thought. ""The goods were cheap enough at fifty-five, and she is quite as well contented with her bargain as if she had paid only fifty."".

Oh! he looked so pale, and it made me almost sick to hear him cry as if his heart would break"" ""Will he ever forget his crime and disgrace? Will the pressure of that dollar on his conscience ever be removed?"" ""He may never do so wicked an act again; but the memory of this wrong deed cannot be wholly effaced from. Mr. Levering saw his customer of the day previous enter, and move along towards the place where he stood behind his counter. An accusing conscience was quick to conclude as to the object of her visit. But he soon saw that no suspicion of wrong dealing was in the lady's mind. Still there was a pressure on his feelings, which thought could trace to that unlucky dollar.. The storekeeper was counting out the change due his customer. He purposely gave her one dollar more than was justly hers in that transaction. The lady glanced her eyes over the money, and seemed slightly bewildered. Then, much to the storekeeper's relief, opened her purse and dropped it therein. ""All right again!"" was the mental ejaculation of Mr. Levering, as he saw the purse disappear.. ""I'll throw it into the street,"" said he to himself, impatiently. ""Or give it to the first beggar that comes along"" But conscience whispered that the dollar wasn't his, either to give away or to throw away.. ""This is all squeamishness,"" said Mr. Levering trying to argue against his convictions. His convictions remained as clear and rebuking as ever. Such prodigality, or impulsive benevolence, would be at the expense of another, and this could not mend the matter.. Mr. Levering dropped the dollar into the contribution box at the close of the morning service. He could not send it back to the lady and tell her the whole truth. Such an exposure of himself would not only be humiliating, but hurtful to his character. It would be seeking to do right, in the infliction of a wrong to himself. At last, Mr Levering decided to give the money to the treasury..

But baby was in eager pursuit of something, and the call, if heard, was unheeded. His eyes were opening world-ward, and every new phenomenon--commonplace and unheeding by us--that addressed itself to his senses, became a wonder and a delight. Some new object was drawing him away from the loving heart and protecting arm of his mother. ""Arty! Arty!"" she said. ""What is the child after? Just look at him,Mr. Mayflorence!"". ""What is it, darling? What is Arty running after?"" I said, as I laid my hand on his arm, and checked his eager speed. He struggled a moment, and then stood still, stooping forward for something on the ground. There was a disappointed and puzzled look in his face as he lifted his eyes to mine. He failed to secure the object of his pursuit. ""It's only your shadow! Foolish child!"" I exclaimed, catching him up in my arms. And I ran back to Mrs. Mayflower, with a touch of anxiety in her voice. ""He might fall and hurt himself."". ""So life begins--and so it ends! Poor Arty!"" I said to myself. ""Always in pursuit of shadows! We lose to-day's substantial good for shadowy phantoms that keep our eyes ever in advance, and our feet ever hurrying forward!"" ""O, deluded heart!--ever bartering away substance for shadow!"" I thought. ""I grow philosophic sometimes"" I said. ""How little the wiser are we for moralizing!"" I added. ""We look into the mirror of truth, and see ourselves--then turn away, and forget what manner of men we are"". The author's daily routine was disturbed by impatient aspirations. He spent the larger part of this day in the perpetration of a plan for increasing his gains beyond, anything heretofore achieved. The regular, orderly progression of a fair and well-established business was too slow for his outreaching desires. Better for us if it were not so; if we remembered the image that held our vision, he says. He writes: ""Better for us to remember the image of our vision.""

If everything is not on the square, I'll give you the word in time"" ""It's all right, I've no doubt,"" said my clerk. ""Let him have what he want, Edward"".

""I am not a man who can be persuaded to do anything he doesn't want to do."". ""Have the goods sold to that new customer from Alton been delivered?"" I asked, as the real interest of my wasted day loomed up into sudden importance. ""Yes, sir,"" was answered by one of my clerks; ""they were sent to Kline & Co.'s immediately"" ""He's a safe man, I should think,"" I said. ""He was a good man,"" said the clerk. ""I'm sure he was,"" I replied. ""But he's a bad man, too."" ""He is,"" replied the clerk, ""but he's not a dangerous man."" ""I am a good person,"" said I, ""and he is a bad person."" ""And I am a dangerous person, too,"" said he, "". ""They sell him only for cash,"" said my clerk. ""It has a bad look,"" said I. ""How large a bill did he make with us?"" ""Five or six times beyond the amount of his purchases with them"" ""He's a new man, who bought a moderate cash bill, but was sending in large quantities of goods to be packed,"" said the clerk, ""and they sell him."" ""Is that so!"" I exclaimed, rising to my feet, all awake now to the real things which I had permitted. ""What! I thought he was to buy only to the amount of a thousand dollars?"" I returned, in surprise and dismay. ""Seventeen hundred dollars,"" replied the clerk. ""It's too late,"" answered my clerk, ""B----called a little after one o'clock, and gave notes for the amount"" ""I think, Edward,"" said I, ""that you'd better step round to Kline & Co.'s, and ask if they've shipped B----'s goods yet"" ""If not, we'll request them to delay long enough in the morning to give us time.

""As sober as baby looked this morning, after his fruitless shadow chase,"" I replied. ""I have been chasing a shadow all day; a mere phantom scheme of profit,"" I continued. ""And at night-fall I not only lose my shadow, but find my feet far off from the right path, and bemired."" ""I called Arty a foolish child this morning. I laughed at his mistake,"" I said.. Mrs. Mayflower sighed gently. ""I am afraid we are all, more or less, in pursuit of shadows,"" she said.

'We shall grow wiser' 'We'll grow happier,' she said, 'unless we do'. ""Few, if any, I fear,"" she answered; ""and few, if many, are happy"" ""Happiness is a state of life,"" she said.

""And a calm trust in the Giver of all good for the blessing that lies stored for each one prepared to receive it in every hour of the coming time"" ""We cannot catch it by pursuit,"" she replied. ""That is only a cheating counterfeit, in guilt and tinsel, which dazzles our eyes in the ever receding future"". ""No--no! Not yet, my sweet one!"" answered Mrs. Mayflower, hugging him to her heart. ""Not yet. We cannot spare you from our world of shadows"" ""We are always losing the happiness of our to-days; and our to to-morrows never come,"" said Arty, who lay fast asleep on my bosom"
0.63,0.73,51.95473251028807,"Two boys, named Jacob Peters and Ralph Gilpin were passing along Chestnut Street one evening about ten years ago, when one of them, stopped, and said, ""Come, Ralph, let us have some oysters. I've got a quarter."" They were in front of an oyster-cellar. Ralph, replied Ralph, firmly. ""I'm not going down there."" ""I didn't mean that we should get anything to drink,"". Ralph was afraid of hurting his good name by going to the pub. Jacob said he would not mind if he did. Ralph said he preferred the clear conscience and the good opinion together. Jacob replied: ""Come, are you going to join me in a plate of oysters?"" But Ralph stood immovable. He said: ""I'll try to do right and be right, and not bother myself about what people may think"" He then left the pub, and never returned.. Jacob Peters and Ralph Gilpin were neighbors. They were planning a row-boat excursion on the Schuylkill. Jacob said he would take Tom Forsyth, a splendid rower. Ralph objected: ""He doesn't bear a good character"" Jacob said, ""O, well; that's nothing to us."" Ralph said, 'I think it is a great deal to us' Jacob said: 'I'm sorry you're afraid to do right for fear. ""I don't see how our taking Tom Forsyth along is going to taint your name, or mine either,"" said Jacob. ""He's a bad boy,"" Ralph firmly objected. ""You and I have both seen him foolish from drink. And we know that he was sent home from a good place, under circumstances that threw suspicion on his honesty."" ""I am not going to be seen in his company. I think too much of my good name."" ""Let people judge; who cares?"" replied Jacob.. ""I'm not going in company with Tom Forsyth if I never go boating,"" said Jacob. Ralph's face burned with anger, but he kept back the sharp words that sprung to his lips. ""There's no use in you're getting mad about it, Jacob. If you prefer Tom to me, very well. I haven't set my heart on going."" ""I've spoken to Tom already"" said Jacob, cooling off a little. ""And he's promised to go; so there's no getting away from it"". Tom Forsyth was on a boating excursion with his father. He saw a man looking at him with a look of surprise and disapprobation. The man turned to the boy, Tom Forsyth, and said: 'You're not going to be in the store, are you?' The boy thought he saw something of disapproval in the man's face. The boy said he didn't know who the man was, but that he felt uncomfortable. The next day the boy went to the store and was employed. He was not allowed to go back to the boat until he had finished his work. He never went back to that boat.. The father sent back a polite note, expressing regret at the change of view, and asking that his son should still be borne in mind. When he entered the store, the first person he met was the man who looked at him so closely in the oyster saloon and on the wharf at Fairmount. Jacob handed him the note, which he opened and read, and then gave him a cold bow. He had been misjudged, and here was the unhappy result. His good name had suffered, and yet he had done nothing actually wrong.. Ralph Gilpin tells his friend Jacob that he is going into a store next week. ""I'm going to A. & L.'s. Father got me the place. Don't you think I'm lucky? They're very particular about the boys they taking that store"" Jacob: ""They promised father that I should have the place."" ""O, no!"" ejaculated Jacob, his face flushing, ""not there!"" ""They acted very meanly,"" said Jacob, showing. Ralph suggested to Jacob that he might have been seen in a drinking saloons or in company with Tom Forsyth. ""O, that's only your guess,"" he replied, tossing his head, and putting on an incredulous look. But he felt in his heart that the suggestion of Ralph was true. Ralph continued as careful as in the beginning to preserve a good name. He was not content simply with doing right; but felt that it was a duty to himself, and to all who might, in any way, be dependent on him, to appear right also. The years passed on; and Ralph continued to do right.. ""I do nothing that I'm not proud of,"" says Jacob. ""I am not ashamed of what I do,"" he says. ""It is my right to do it."" ""I don't care what people think of me,"" he adds, ""I just do it"" ""I'm not afraid of the world,"" he insists, ""and I don't fear the future."" ""It's my duty to do what I think is right,"" he writes. ""To do what is right, even if it is not right."" ""If you want to do something, do it,"" he tells his son. ""Don't.  talent and industry are wanted in, business, but the passport of a good character must accompany them. All the avenues to success are thickly crowded with men of talent, industry, and energy. It is, therefore, of the first importance to preserved a good name, for this, if united with ability and industry, with double your chances of success in life. The best way to get ahead in business is to have a good reputation. The most successful men are those who have the reputation of being good people. The worst men are the ones who are not good people, but have a reputation for being good. This is the way to make a name for yourself in the world.. Jacob was a clerk in the house of A. & L. L. He was in every way competent to take the position, which commanded a salary of eighteen hundred dollars. Ralph Gilpin, who was a salesman, said all that he could in Jacob's favor. But the latter had not been careful to preserve a good name, and this was against him. The place was one of trust, and the members of the firm, after considering the matter, decided adversely. Nothing as to fact was alleged or known. Not a word as to his conduct in life was said against him, but he had often been seen in company with young men who did not bear a solid reputation.. Jacob Peters was a successful businessman. He lost his business through his own fault. He felt gloomy and disappointed for a time. A gentleman said to him that good fortune was coming in the way of good fortune. He feared that he would lose his business. He was haunted by the thought that he had lost his opportunity. He had lost the chance to secure a good business deal. He believed that he was going to lose his life. He thought of suicide, and of leaving his wife and children behind. But he decided to stay on. He became a successful business man.. Jacob Peters, a young man, was at once elevated to the mountain-top of hope, and felt, for a time, bewildered in prospect of the good fortune awaited him. The young man was in conversation with Mr. A., of the firm of A. & L. L. A. The capitalist asked Jacob's opinion in the matter. ""I believe it has been finally settled that Jacob Peters is to be the man,"" he said. ""So let me congratulate you, my young friend, on this good fortune"". ""He is a young man of decided business qualities,"" said the, other. ""I feel considerably embarrassed in regard to this matter,"" said Mr. A. ""If you know of any reason why I should not associate this young man with me in business I trust you will speak without reserve"" ""This is a matter, to me, of the first importance,"" replied the, others. ""We have considerable dealing with the house in which he is employed"". ""I have seen him in company with young men whose characters are not fair,"" said the gentleman. ""He may be all right; is all right, perhaps; but--"" ""The matter is settled. It may be with him, as you say. But he can never be a partner of mine."" ""And now, passing from him, I wish to ask about another young man, who has been in my mind second to Peters."" ""Ralph Gilpin, you mean"". Jacob Peters was disappointed when Ralph Gilpin was chosen to be a partner in a new firm. ""I am set aside and he is taken. It is a bitter, bitter disappointment!"" he said. Three years have passed, and Gilpin is on the road to fortune, while Peters remains a clerk. And why? The one was careful of his good name; the other was not. ""My young reader, take the lesson to heart,"" he said, ""and take the story of this young man's disappointment in being set aside by his friend Ralph Gil pin"". ""Guard your spirit, so that no evil thing enter there"" ""Your good name shall be only the expression of"

The trees looked like great shadows. Not many stay here in the winter time, but fly away to the sunny south, where the air is warm and the trees green.. Alice's mother's kiss was still warm upon her lips as she passed into the world of pleasant dreams. The pigeon did not seem to be afraid of her, though she saw its little pink eyes looking right into her own. She said in soft, pitying tones, raising the window gently, so that it might not be frightened away. Then she stepped back and waited to see if the bird would not come in.. Pigeon raised its brown head in a half scared away; turned it to this side and to that; and after looking first at the, comfortable chamber and then away at the snow-covered earth, quietly hopped upon the sill inside. Next he flew upon the back of a chair, and then down upon the floor. After. ""If he had only known how kind I would have been, and how safe he was here, he wouldn't have flown away,"" says Alice. ""The little Pigeon"" is a poem written by Charles Dickens. The poem is about a young girl and her father. ""I was so happy to see you,"" says the little girl. ""You were so kind to me,"" says her father, ""and I was so glad to see. Alice threw open the window, and then ran into the kitchen for some crumbs of bread. When she came back, pigeon was still on the fence. Then she called to him, holding out her her hand scattering a few crumbs on the window-sill. The bird was hungry and had sharp eyes, and when he saw Alice he no doubt remembered the nice meal she had given him in the morning.. ""I would like so much to see him and feed him,"" she said. ""But I know he's better off and happier at his own home"" ""You are so good!"" he cooed a little.. ""A holy gift is thine, sweet bird!

0.67,0.77,50.49618320610687,"The mother of three died in a drunken fit in front of her frightened children. She had been despised, scoffed at, and angrily denounced by nearly every man, woman, and child in the village. Now, as the fact of her death was passed from lip to lip, in subdued tones, pity took the place of anger, and sorrow of denunciation. The children, aged between ten and eleven, were bright, active girl, out of whom something clever might be made, if in good hands. But poor little Maggie, the youngest, was hopelessly diseased. The mother's body lay cold and still amid her wretched children, three in number.. Katy had been bound since a fall from a window had injured her spine. She had not been able to leave her bed since, except when lifted in the arms of her mother. The children must not be left to starve, said farmer Jones. Mrs Ellis, who had been looking out for a bound girl, concluded that it would be charitable in her to make choice of Katy, even though she was too young to be of much use for several years. ""I could do much better, I know,"" said Mrs Ellis of Katy.. Maggie's sad eyes and patient face touched many hearts, and even knocked at them for entrance. Pitying glances were cast on her wan and wasted form. Mothers brought cast-off garments and, removing her soiled and ragged clothes, dressed her in clean attire. But none opened to take her in. Who wanted a bed-ridden child? The question ""What's to be done with Maggie?"" was asked.. ""The poorhouse is a sad place for a sick and helpless child,"" answered one. ""Nobody's going to be bothered with her,"" said another. The day following the day of death was made the dayof burial. A few neighbors were at the miserable hovel, but none followed dead cart as it bore the unhonored remains to its pauper grave. ""Bid your sister good by,"" Mrs. Ellis spoke to Kate with a hurried air, ""Bids your sistergood by"" ""I'm sorry I couldn't do more to help you,"" said John.. Maggie was alone. Joe Thompson, the wheelwright, paused, and said to the blacksmith's wife, who was hastening off with the rest, ""It's a cruel thing to leave her so"" A vague terror had come into her thin white face. ""O, Mr. Thompson!"" she cried out, catching her suspended breath, ""don't leave me here all alone!"" ""Then take her to the poorhouse: she'll have to go there,"" answered the blackmith's wife.. ""No, dear,"" he answered, in a kind voice, going to the bed, and stooping down over the child. ""You sha'n't be left here alone."" Then he wrapped her with the gentleness almost of a woman, in the clean bedclothes which some neighbor had brought. He then lifted her out into the air and across the field that lay between the hovel and his home. He was pleased to have them come to his shop, where sleds and wagons were made or mended for the village lads without a draft on their hoarded sixpences.. Joe Thompson brought home a sick child to his wife. His wife's face was filled with anger and astonishment. Joe said, ""I think women's hearts are sometimes very hard"" The child, Maggie, was very sick. Joe carried her to a small chamber on the first floor, and laid her on a bed. Then, stepping back, he stood face to face with his vinegar-tempered wife in the passage-way outside. The child was very ill, and Joe was very worried.. ""Women's hearts are not half so hard as men's,"" says Joe Thompson. ""Farmer Jones tossed John into his wagon, and drove off. Katie went home with Mrs. Ellis,"" he says. ""Nobody wanted the poor sick one,"" says his wife. ""Send her to the poorhouse,"" was the cry."" ""Why didn't you let her go, then?"" asks Mrs. Thompson. 'Because she was a girl,"" says the farmer. ""And I was a man."" ""I'm not going to let her die in a hut,"" says Mr. Thompson, ""and. ""She can't walk to the poorhouse,"" said Joe; ""somebody's arms must carry her, and mine are strong enough for that task"" ""Why didn't you keep on? Why did you stop here?"" demanded the wife. ""Because I'm not apt to go on fools' errands. The Guardians must first be seen, and a permit obtained"" ""Go at once for the permit, and get the whole thing. Joe Thompson said to his wife, ""Look at her kindly, Jane; speak to her kindly"" Mrs. Thompson did not reply, but presently turned towards the little chamber where her husband had deposited Maggie; and, pushing open the door, went quietly in. Joe Thompson said, ""Think of her dead mother, and the loneliness, the pain, the sorrow that must be on all her coming life."" The softness of his heart gave unwonted eloquence to his lips. ""Now, it is a small thing for us to keep this poor motherless little one for a single night,"" he said.. Joe Thompson saw that his wife's state had changed, and felt that it would be best to leave her alone with the child. So he went to his shop, which stood near the house, and worked until dusky evening released him from labor. A light shining through the little chamber windows was the first object that attracted Joe's attention on turning towards the house: it was a good omen. He saw that her eyes were intently fixed upon his wife; that now and then a few words came, as if in answers from her lips; that her expression was sad and tender; but he saw nothing of bitterness or pain.. Joe Thompson's wife was with Maggie in the kitchen. Joe thought it best not to refer to the child, nor to manifest any concern in regard to her. A pair of large bright eyes looked up at him from the snowy bed. Joe glanced from his wife's face to that of Maggie; she understood him, and answered,--""She can wait until we are done; then I will bring her somethings to eat."" There was an effort at indifference on the part of Mrs. Thompson, looking into the room a little while afterwards. Joe left the kitchen, and went to the little bedroom.. Joe Thompson and his wife sat down to a meal at their home. Mrs. Thompson kept silent for many minutes before asking her husband what he was going to do with their daughter. The subject was not again referred to during the meal. At its close, she toasted a slice of bread, and softened, it with milk and butter; adding to this a cup of tea, she took them into Maggie, and held the small waiter, on which she had placed them, while the hungry child ate with every sign of pleasure. Joe Thompson's wife then asked him, ""I thought you understood me that she was to. Maggie Thompson was taken to the Guardians of the Poor by her mother. Joe Thompson was told he must go and see them about Maggie. He did not see them again for the rest of the week. Maggie died in less than a week after being taken in by the Guardians. The story of Maggie's life is told in the book, ""Maggio's Story,"" by David Walliams, published by Simon & Schuster, priced £16.99.. Maggie Thompson was a sick and helpless child who was adopted by Joe Thompson, the poor wheelwright. Joe Thompson's wife had nothing to love and care for out of herself, and so became sore, irritable, ill-tempered, and self-afflicting in the desolation of her woman's nature. The sweetness of that sick child, looking ever to her in love, patience, and gratitude, was as honey to her soul, and she carried her in her heart as well as in her arms, a precious burden.

Lovell's shoes fitted so neatly, and wore so long, that the village people could ill afford to break with him. The work made by Tompkins was strong enough, but Tompkin was no artist in leather.. Andy Lovell fell in love with a village beauty, and was betrothal soon after. From a free-handed young man, he became prudent and saving. In a single year he laid by enough to warrant setting up business for himself. He was ambitious to lay up money for his wife's and children's sake, as well as to secure for himself the means of rest from labor. The consequence was, that Andy served his neighbors, in his vocation, to their highest satisfaction.. Andy Lovell's customers noticed a change in the man. He was less anxious to accommodate; disappointed them oftener. Customers, getting discouraged or offended, dropped away, but it gave Andy no concern. He had, no longer, any heart in his business; and worked in it more like an automaton than a live human being. At last, Andy suddenly made up his mind to shut up his shop, and retire from business.. ""I won't stand it any longer,"" said Andy Lovell. He and his wife had enough money to live on for the rest of their lives. But they couldn't bear to continue in the way they had been. They decided to leave the country. The decision to leave was a shock to the couple, and to many others. They left the country, and their lives changed forever.. Andy Lovell was tired of working without any heart in his work. He kept to his resolution, and went on with his arrangements for closing the shop. The retirement of Andy, cross and unaccommodating as he had become, was felt, in many homes, to be a public calamity. But Andy Lovell kept his resolution.. ""Rust will eat him up,"" said the neighbor. ""A man in good health, at your time of life, can't be idle. What are you. ""Which knife is oldest?"" asked the neighbor. ""This has been in constant use,"" replied the shoemaker. ""And so has become rusted and good for nothing,"" said the neighbor, ""half eaten up with rust, andGood for nothing. Andy Lovell had, as we have see, no longer any heart in his business. All that he desired was obtained--enough to live on comfortably. Why, then, should he trouble himself with hard-to-please and ill-natured customers? This was one side of the question. The rusty knife suggested the other side.. Andy Lovell's shop closed its doors for the last time on the last day of business. The future looked very blank. There was nothing in it to strive for. Andy was no philosopher. He could not reason from any deep knowledge of human nature. His life had been merely sensational, touching scarcely the confines of interior thought. Now he felt that he was getting adrift, but could not understand the why.. Andy Lovell received a letter from his sister-in-law, who had died suddenly. She left three young children, two girls and a boy. Mrs. Lovell was deeply afflicted by this news, and abandoned herself, for a while, to excessive grief. Her husband had no consolation to offer, and so remained, for the evening, silent and thoughtful. Andy Lovell did not sleep well that night.. Andy Lovell opened his shop door, and put back the shutters, as usual. Mrs. Lovell did not, at first, regard the opening of her husband's shop as anything unusual. Sally Lovell went to see her husband, Andy, at his old shop. She asked him why he had changed his mind. He said he had been thinking about it all night, and it hurt him dreadfully. She said they had to do something about the children. Andy said, ""There's just one thing we've got to do; and it's no use trying. Sally Lovell was reluctant to bring three children into her home. She had tried to convince herself that her dead sister's children would be happy and well cared for. Andy Lovell, her husband, was also reluctant to take on the responsibility of caring for the children. The couple decided to wait until the children were born. The children were due to be born in the spring of 2013.. Andy Lovell's wife decided to send for their children. Andy was busy in his shop. He knew that his wife would send for the children; and after their arrival, he knew that he would have increased expenses. So, there had come a spur to action, quickening the blood in his veins; and he was at work once more, with heart and purpose, a happier man, really, than he had been for years.. Andy is not a more cheerful man in all the village, though he is in his shop early and late. No more complaints from customers. Every one is promptly and cheerfully served. He is the bright, sharp knife, always in use; not the idle"

It was evident that he anticipated some reluctance on the boy's part, and therefore, assumed, in the outset, a very decided manner. The boy dropped the volume in his lap, and looked up with a slightly flushed, but sullen face.. ""Go get your hat and jacket,"" said Mr. Belknap. ""I'm tired of this ill-mannerd, disrespectful way of yours"" The boy stood up, looking, now, dogged, as well as sullen. Like a soulless automaton passed he out into the passage and up the stairs. The impatient father could with difficulty restrain an impulse to follow after, and hasten the sulky boy's movements with blows. He controlled himself, however, and resumed the perusal of his newspaper.. John Thomas had not yet appeared to do the errand upon which his father designed to send him. Mr. Belknap dropped his paper, and going hastily to the bottom of the stairs, called out: ""You John! John Thomas!"" The boy opened a closet, and, singularly enough, there hung his jacket in full view. The boy was quite in earnest in this threat, a fact plainly enough apparent to John Thomas in the tone of his father's voice.. The boy was standing before his disturbed father, with his jacket on, and buttoned up to the chin. Mr. Belknap said: ""I'm out of all patience with your slow movements and sulky manner"" The boy answered not, but walked moodily to the rack, and took his hat therefrom. All was too dark, sullen, and rebellious within his bosom. The boy made a feeble effort to throw a few rays of sunshine into his face. But, the effort died fruitless. John Thomas was sent to get a good claw hammer and three pounds of eightpenny nails. The boy turned off without a word of reply, and was slowly moving away when his father said, sharply: ""Look here, sir!"" John Thomas paused and looked back. ""Why did n't you indicate, in some way, that you heard me? Have n't I already this morning read you a lecture about this very thing?"". John Thomas moved away at a snail's pace. Mr. Belknap was in a state of considerable irritability. He felt strongly tempted to call him back, and give him a good flogging. But as this flogging was an unpleasant kind of business, he restrained his impulses. ""I wish I knew what to do with him,"" he said. ""There is no respect or obedience in him"" ""What is to be done with him, Aunt Mary?"" he asked. ""He goes creeping along like a tortoise, and ten chances to one, if he does n't forget his errand altogether before. Mr. Belknap spoke to an elderly lady, who was paying him a brief visit. He said he had tried everything with the boy, but he was incorrigible. Aunt Mary asked him to speak to her in a kind, affectionate, unimpassioned manner with him. Mr. Bel Knap replied, ""To me? Why yes! The plainer the better."" He then said, ""I notice that you speak to him in a cold, indifferent, or authoritative tone"". ""Forgive me, if I have spoken too plainly,"" said Aunt Mary. ""Under such treatment, some natures, that soften quickly in the sunshine of affection, grow hard and stubborn"" Mr. Belknap did not make any response for some time, but sat, with his eyes upon the floor, in hurried self-examination. ""I needed that suggestion, and thank you for having made it,"" he said. ""Mrs. Howitt has a line which beautifully expresses what I mean,"" she said.. John Thomas was still absent. Mr. Belknap was particularly in want of the hammer and nails. Sometimes he would yield to a momentary blinding flush of anger, and resolve to punish the boy severely. But quickly would come in Aunt Mary's suggestion, and he would again resolve to try the power of kind words. He was also a good deal strengthened in his purposes, by the fact that aunt Mary's eyes would be upon him at the return of John Thomas at the end of the day. He would then be able to concentrate on the task at hand, and not be distracted by the thoughts of his son.. ""There comes that boy now,"" said he, as he glanced forth, and saw John Thomas coming homeward at a very deliberate pace. There was more of impatience in his tone of voice than he wished to betray to Aunt Mary, who let her beautiful, angel-like eyes rest for a moment or two, penetratingly, upon him. The balancing power of that look was needed; and it performed its work. The loitering boy came in and Mr. Belknap took him in his arms.. John Belknap forgot to nail up a trellice for his mother's honeysuckle and wisteria. His father said he would run down to the store and get it for him in a minute. The boy looked at his father a moment or two with an air of bewilderment and surprise; then he said, earnestly: ""I'm very sorry that I forgot it."" The father said, ""Run along, then,"" and left.. John Belknap, kindly, asked his father to send him to work in the garden. His father said he could not have asked a prompter service. John bounded away, leaving his father with an emotion of surprise and pleasure. The story was told in a play called ""The Gardeners' Son"" by John Belknaps. The play was written by John B. Belknappers, who also wrote ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" and ""The Secret of the Sphinx"" The book was published in 1852.. ""O, I'll go, father--I'll go,"" replied the boy, quickly and cheerfully. ""I'll run right over at once."" A grateful look was cast, by his father, into his face, and then he was off to do his errand. ""Aunt Mary and Howitt are right. I ought to have learned this lesson earlier,"" he said. ""Ah! how much that is deformed in this self-willed boy, might now be growing"
0.3,0.4,25.470809792843692,"""Miserable,"" was the faintly spoken reply. The doctor laid his fingers on the wrist. Under the pressure he felt the pulse beat slowly and evenly. There was a no fever, nor any unusual disturbance of the system.. ""My head is well enough, but I feel so miserable--so weak. I haven't the strength of a child. The least exertion exhausts me."" ""Have you taken the tonic, for which I left a prescription. ""You must have the fresh air, Mrs. Carleton,"" said the doctor, emphatically. ""Fresh air, change of scene, and exercise, are indispensable in your case. Come, take a ride with me."" ""Doctor! How absurd! What would people think?"". Mrs. Carleton had not smiled before since the doctor came in. Fashion and conventionality were losing their influence, since enfeebled health kept her feet back from the world's gay places. The doctor's invitation to a ride found her sufficiently disenthralled. ""I'm afraid, doctor, it will be too much for me,"" said the maid. ""You don't know how weak I am,"" replied Dr. Farleigh. ""A thought of appearances--of what people will say,"" replied the doctor.. Dr. Farleigh: ""Mrs. McFlimsey, perhaps the experiment might be adventured. But she is always out on fine days"" Mrs. Carleton: ""Doctor, for shame! How can you say that?"" The doctor: ""Not I; nor of. ""Lean back when you see Mrs. McFlimsey's carriage, and draw your veil closely. She'll never dream that it's you"" ""I'll get angry if you play on that string much longer!"" exclaimed Mrs. Carleton.. ""I can't leave you alone in the carriage. Ned might take a fancy to walk off with you,"" said the doctor. ""O, no; excuse me, doctor. I've no taste for such things,"" answered the lady.. The doctor and Mrs. Carleton went to a house in a poor neighborhood. The doctor said he might find a panacea there. The woman said, ""I can never go in there, doctor"". The woman was too weak to rise from her chair, but she asked Mrs. Carleton to be seated in a tone of lady-like self-possession that did not escape the visitor's observation. On her lap a baby was sleeping, as sweet, and pure, and beautiful a. The doctor asked Leslie how she slept. She answered in a calm, patient way. The heart of Mrs. Carleton was opening towards--the baby and it was a baby to make its way into any heart.. ""Will you sit here until I visit two or three patients in the block?"" she asked. ""O, certainly,"" and she reached out her arms for the baby. When the doctor returned he noticed that there had been tears in Mrs. Carleton's eyes.. ""You are better for this ride,"" remarked the doctor, as he handed her from the carriage. Mrs. Carleton was silent for most of the way home. She had seen a phase of life that touched her deeply.. Mrs. Carleton looked steadily at the doctor. ""You are in earnest,"" she said, in a calm, firm way. ""Your disease is mental inaction."". ""You must give that sick woman a ride into the country. The fresh, pure, blossom-sweet air will do her good"" ""For shame, doctor! But you are too late in. ""As my best friend, always,"" said Mrs. Carleton. ""But I may visit you occasionally"

For my part, I never take sides in these matters"" ""It not unfrequently happens that one party to a difference is not at all to blame, but merely stands on a just and honorable defensive"" ""I have never been able to tell you a story that I have not seen in a movie or a play."" ""I've never seen a movie that has not been in a play or a movie."" ""There are no doubt times when both are equally to blame."" ""Most generally, however, one party is more to blame than the other"". ""I'll be bound dress has something to do with it,"" grumbled out Mr. Brierly, the husband of one of the ladies. ""He thinks we care for nothing but dress,"" replied Mrs. Briers. ""I never knew a case of this kind where both were not to blame."" ""They say it is about a head-dress,"" said Mrs. Tarleton. ""But don't you know the ground of the difference?"" ""I can hardly tell,"" replied the other woman. ""Nor I."" ""I'll have to go and get a glass of wine,"" said the other lady.. Mrs. Bates received from her sister in New York a new and very beautiful head-dress, which had been obtained through a friend in Paris. Mrs. Tarleton wanted it very badly, and begged Mrs. Bates for the pattern. But she refused to let her have it, because a grand party was to be given by the Listons in a few weeks, and she wanted to show it off there herself. I tell him it is very well for him and the rest of the world that we have some little regard at least to such matters. I am sure if I didn't think a good deal about dress, he and the children would soon look like scarecrows."" Mr. Brierly responded to this by a ""Humph!"" and resumed the perusal of his newspaper. The story was published in The Sketch, published by The Sketch Society, £3.99, on Thursday. ""Is it possible!"" you ask? ""I have sifted it pretty closely"" ""Yes, and is called by some the Tarleton head-dress, from the first wearer of it"" ""I was at the party, but I saw nothing of this"" ""It certainly was very beautiful, and has become quite fashionable since"" ""No doubt this no doubt galls Mrs. Bates severely"" ""Well, I declare! I remember Mrs. Tarleton's head- dress, however, very well"" ""Is it Possible?"" you ask. ""I believe, I believe, that is about the truth of the whole matter."" ""Yes,"" you say, ""it is possible!"". ""Extreme vanity always gets mortified, and in this case I think justly so"" ""Besides, it was very unladylike to insult Mrs. Tarleton in public"" ""A true lady, under circumstances of this kind, seems perfectly unaware of what has occurred"" ""She shuns, with the utmost carefulness, any appearance of an affront at so trivial a matter, even if she feels it"" ""It is more than probable that this circumstance has widened the breach"" ""They say she is a vain woman."" ""She should have taken no notice of it whatever"" ""I think Mrs. Bates was served perfectly right for her selfish vanity"" ""Mrs. Bates is a very vain woman,"" said another.. The head-dress was a gift from a sister in New York to Mrs. Bates. The style was quite attractive, though neither unbecoming nor showy. Mrs Bates had her own share of vanity, and wished to appear at a large party soon to take place, in this head- Dress. Both were considered to blame, and nearly equally so; but whether the parties really misunderstood their own or each other's true position will be seen when the truth appears. The head- dress, after being admired, was laid aside for the occasion refrered to. A few days afterwards, Mrs. Tarleton, an acquaintance, dropped in. She said, ""I have something beautiful to show you,"" said Mrs. Bates.. Mrs. Tarleton had an extravagant love of dress, and was an exceedingly vain woman. Mrs. Bates asked to see the head-dress. Mrs Tarleton was delighted with it. She said it was the loveliest thing she had ever seen. She wanted to wear it to Mrs. Liston's party. Mrs Bates said she would not. The pair were married in April, 1837. The wedding was held at the Crippen Hotel, in London. The party was attended by Mrs Liston and her husband, the Earl of Shrewsbury, and a large crowd of other guests. The evening was described as a ""party of fun and entertainment"". ""Beautiful! How well it becomes you! you must let me have the pattern. We can wear them together at the party. Two will attract more attention than one"" Mrs. Bates said no as gently as she could. She had set her heart upon appearing in that head-dress as something new and beautiful. She could not consent to share the distinction, especially with Mrs. Tarleton, for whom, although a friend, she entertained not the highest esteem, and for the reason that Mrs Tarleton had asked her to wear the cap on her head. ""I am sorry to deny you,"" replied Mrs.Tarleton, ""but I think I shall have to be alone in my glory this time."" ""I never saw anything in my life that pleased me so much, nor anything in which I looked so well. I have been all over town for a. Mrs. Tarleton had rather a vulgar mind, and lacked a lady's true perceptions of propriety. ""It wouldn't do you a bit of harm to let me have the pattern, and would gratify me more than I can tell,"" said Mrs. Bates. ""I will give you the head-dress and let you wear it, as long as you seem to have set your heart so upon it,"" replied Mrs.Tarleton. ""Well, I must say you are a selfish woman,"" returned Mrs. Bates, ""but it seems strange that you are not willing for us to wear the same head- dress"" ""I'll tell you what I will do,"" said the woman, ""I'm going to. ""I have several very intimate friends, between whom and myself relations of even a closer kind exist than have yet existed between you and me,"" said Mrs. Tarleton. ""That is more than I ought to ask or you to give,"" replied Mrs. Bates. ""I will defer the matter entirely to you. You shall have the head-dress and I will choose some other one"" ""You can't imagine what a sweet head- dress Mrs.Tarleton has made for me,"" replied the sister. ""It is the best I can do,"" said the sister, with a quiet smile. ""You shall have it, and I'll have another one."" ""I suppose I must give it up, then,"" saidMrs. Tarleton, in a slightly disappointed tone.. The head-dress is the most unique and beautiful thing I ever saw. I tried hard for the pattern, but the selfish creature wouldn't let me have it. She is keeping it for the Liston's party, where it will be the admiration of every one. I wish now I had asked her to let me bring it home to show it to you."" Mrs. Bates did not object to letting Mrs. Tarleton take the head- Dress and show it. Mrs.Tarleton had the fullest confidence that she would not do anything with it that she knew was against her wishes. Mrs.-Bates' wishes had been clearly expressed in her letter to Mrs.-Tarleton, which she had sent to her sister in New York. The letter was returned to Mrs-Tarleton.. Mrs. Tarleton was in raptures with the head-dress. Her sister said it was mean and selfish in Mrs. Bates not to let you have the pattern. ""What a vain woman she must be,"" she said. ""I always thought better of her"" ""Then while you have a chance, take it to Madame Pinto and get her to make you one exactly like it"" ""I have a great mind to do it; it would serve her perfectly right."" ""I wouldn't hesitate a moment,"" urged the sister. ""At the last party, Mrs. Bates managed to have on something new that attracted every one and threw others into the shade"" ""So did I. But this shows what she is."". Mrs. Tarleton was given a head-dress by a fashionable milliner and dress maker. The milliner said she would make one exactly similar for Mrs.Tarleton. After charging the milliner over and over again to keep the matter a profound secret, Mrs. tarleton yielded to the evil counsel, which was seconded by her own heart. The head- dress was returned to Mrs. Bates after only a couple of hours. It had been the loveliest thing you ever saw,"" said Mrs. Pinto, taking from a box a facsimile of Mrs Tarleton's head. The story was told by Mrs. Bates, who was a friend of Mrs. Tarleton's. The tale was told in a play called ""The Loves of the Loves"". ""Isn't it sweet?"" she said. ""Who is it for?"" ""It's a secret, but I can tell you. It is for Mrs. Tarleton"" ""Ah! Where did she get the pattern?"" ""I don't know; she brought it here, but said she couldn't leave it for the world"" ""Oh, no. Somebody had it who was going to show it off at the party, she said; but she meant to surprise her."" ""Have you any new patterns for head-dresses not chosen by the ladies who have made selections of you?"" ""Yes, I have."". Mrs. Bates felt justly outraged at the conduct of Mrs. Tarleton. She did not speak of what had taken place, except to one or two very intimate friends and to her husband. Mrs. Pinto had betrayed her secret, and Mrs. Bates had no choice but to throw it away. The evening of the party at length arrived. Mrs Tarleton was there a little earlier than Mrs. Bates. The beautiful head-dress she wore attracted every eye, and in the admiration won by the display of her taste, she lost all the shame she had felt in anticipation of meeting Mrs. bates. Mrs Pinto. had been the mistress of Mrs Bates' husband. She had been mistress of Mr. Bates' wife, Mrs B.. Mrs. Bates, justly outraged by what had occurred, had thrown aside her beautiful cap and selected another. Mrs. Tarleton was both hurt and offended at this, and immediately after the party, commenced talking about it and mis-stating the whole transaction, so as not to appear so much to blame as she really was. Mrs Bates, on the contrary, said little on the subject, except to a few very intimate friends, and to those who made free to ask her about it, to whom she said, after giving fairly the cause of complaint against Mrs Tarleton--""I spoke to her coldly because I wished our more intimate acquaintance to cease"" Mrs. Bates was a woman whom Mrs.Tarleton would be sorry to offend seriously, because her position in certain circles was undoubted, while her own was a little questionable.. ""No apologies, if she would even make them, could change the wrong spirit from which she acted,"" said Mrs. Bates. ""Her conduct was unworthy of a lady, and therefore I cannot and will not consider her among my friends,"" she said. ""The wrong done to me I am ready enough to forgive, for it is but a trifling matter,"" she added. ""But the violation of confidence and departure from a truly honest principle, of which she has been guilty, I cannot forgive,"" she concluded. ""They are not sins against me, but against Heaven's first and best laws,"" she wrote. ""If it will be any satisfaction to Mrs. Tarleton to be recognized by me and treated kindly and politely in company, I will most cheerfully yield her all that,"" said Bates.. ""We can never again be on terms of intimacy,"" said Mrs. Tarleton. ""Both were about equally to blame,"" replied Mrs. Bates. ""The reader can now make up his own mind on the subject,"" said Mr. Bates, ""from what has been related"" ""We do not think Mrs.Tarleton was at all to blame in at once withdrawing herself from intimate association with such a woman as Mrs Bates,"" he said. ""We can now never again have intimate relations with each other,"" said the woman.. ""We consider that a false charity which would seek to interfere with or set aside the honest indignation that should always be felt in similar cases of open betrayal of confidence and violation of honest and honorable principles"" ""It is in the ordinary pursuits of business and pleasure where the true character is most prone to exhibit itself, and we must go there if we would read the book of human life aright"" ""We"

""How many are you going to invite?"" inquired Mr. Eldridge. ""Seventy or eighty,"" replied Mrs. Eldridges. ""That will be enough to put life into them I imagine"". A lad about sixteen years of age sat in the room during this conversation, with a book in his hand and his eyes. Henry Eldridge, a Cadets of Temperance, objected to the idea of drinking. His mother, Mrs. Eldridge said, ""If it hurts people to drink, it must be wrong"". ""O, dear, Henry! Don't talk in that kind of way! You make me shudder all over"" ""I suppose he has reformed. But just think, if the taste should be revived again and. Coffee is safe, while wine and brandy are always dangerous in promiscuous companies.

""Let me give you a little experience of my own. It may help you to a right decision in this case"" ""My husband would never consent to it."" ""I saw him holding, a glass of port wine to his lips, which was emptied at a single draught"". When the company returned to the parlors, the flushed face, swimming eyes, and over-hilarious manner of my young friend, showed too plainly that he had been drinking to excess. I thought it might be for a lady upon whom he was in attendance; but no, the sparkling liquor touched his own lips. ""I'm going to have coffee, instead of wine, and brandy,"" said Mrs. Eldridge. ""Why not?"" asked her husband. ""There will be a number of parties given to your niece, without doubt"". ""Nonsense!"" says Mr. Eldridge. ""These liquors are not only expensive, but dangerous things to offer freely in mixed companies"" ""I am afraid to have my conscience burdened with the responsibility which this involves"". ""Your son put it into my head,"" replied Mrs. Eldridge. ""You were in full sail for party this morning, liquor and all; this sudden tacking for a new course is a little surprising."". ""Don't flatter yourself on any such result. We shall stand alone, you may depend upon it."" Mr. Eldridge was particularly nervous on the subject. There were several gentlemen present whom he knew to be lovers of good wine.. Mr. Eldridge tried to speak pleasantly to the lady on his arm, as he ascended to the supper-room. But the words came heavily from his tongue, for his heart was dying in him. Soon the company were around the table, and. Mrs. Eldridge was careful that her entertainment should not prove a failure through any lack of excellence in this article. Having elected to serve coffee, she was careful to serve it in a clear, strong, fragrant, and mellowed cup.. Henry Eldridge was standing by his father when this was said listening with respectful, but deeply gratified attention. ""There will be many, I think, to follow your. ""Your father has reason to be proud of you, my brave boy,"" says the gentleman. ""There is no telling what good may grew out of this thing,"" he adds.. Henry Eldridge was thoughtful, modest, and earnest-minded. He had heard his father and mother speak several times doubtfully as to the result. The result was as had been predicted. Four parties were given to the bride, and in. Henry Eldridge was a happy boy that night.

""I don't visit everybody,"" replied Mrs. Lemmington. ""No, indeed, Mrs. Lemmington, that I am not. I don�. ""Is there anything disgraceful in keeping a school?"" asked Mrs. Marygold. ""No, nor in making shoes, either,"" replied the schoolmaster. ""Let common people associate together--that's my doctrine,"" said the schoolteacher. ""But what do you mean by common people?"" asked the teacher. ""Why, I mean common people. Poor people. People who have not come of a respectable family. That's what I mean,"" said Mrs.Marygold. The teacher's wife replied, ""I am not sure that I comprehend your explanation much better than I do your classification"". ""Perhaps, if some of us were to go back for a generation or two, we might trace out an ancestor who held no higher place in society,"" Mrs. Lemmington remarked. ""Wasn't old Clayton a mere petty dealer in small wares?"" Mrs. Marygold replied. ""I shall never blush when my pedigree is traced,"" she said. ""Nor I neither, I hope"" ""A standard that few will respect, let me tell you,"" replied Mrs. Lommington. ""But, surely, you do not intend refusing to call upon the Claytons for the reason you have assigned, Mrs Lommsen?"". ""I think that I will call upon them,"" said Mrs. Lemmington. ""They are nothing but common people, and therefore beneath me"" ""You can do as you please,"" rejoined Mrs. Marygold. ""For my part, I am particular about my associates"" ""I judge every individual by merit, you by family, or descent."" ""I will visit Mrs. Florence, and Mrs. Clayton."" ""Indeed, I will not, and for the reasons I have given. They are only common people."" ""You will be stooping."" ""No one stoops in doing a kind act."" ""If I find her to be uncongenial in her tastes, no intimate acquaintances. ""Every one to her taste,"" rejoined Mrs. Lemmington, with a smile, as she moved towards the door, where she stood for a few moments to utter some parting compliments, and then withdrew. A brief conversation convinced her that Mrs. Clayton was, in intelligence and moral worth, as far above Mrs. Marygold, as that personage imagined herself to be above her. Her daughters, who came in while she sat conversing with their mother, showed themselves to possess all those graces of mind and manner that win upon our admiration so irresistably. An hour passed quickly and pleasantly. and then Mrs. Lemmington withdrew.. Mrs. Marygold could estimate true worth in humble garb as well as in velvet and rich satins. She was one of those individuals who never pass an old and worthy domestic in the street without recognition. Her grandfather carried a pedlar's pack on his back, and an honest and worthy pedlar he was. His son, the father of Mrs. Mary gold, while a boy had a pretty familiar acquaintance with low life. He saved his pence until they became pounds, and then relinquished his peregrinating propensities, for the quieter life of a small shop-keeper. He never forgot a familiar face, or neglected to pass a kind word to even the humblest who possessed the merit of good principles.. Mrs. Marygold's father chose a young lady whose father, like his own, had grown rich by individual exertions. This young lady had not a few false notions in regard to the true genteel. These fell legitimately to the share of her eldest daughter, who, when she in turn came upon the stage of action, married into an old and what was called a highly respectable family. Mrs. Florence, to whom she had alluded in her conversation with Mrs. Lemmington, and who lived in Sycamore Row, was esteemed in the most intelligent circles for her rich mental endowments and high moral principles. There were few in the circle of her acquaintances who did not fully appreciate her, and smile at her weakness and false pride.. Mrs. Marygold and daughter Melinda were invited to a social evening at Mrs. Harwood's. Mrs. Mary gold was very fond of visiting them for the mere eclat of the thing, yet their company was scarcely more agreeable to her, than hers was to them, for there was little in common between them. The Marygolds repaired to the elegant residence of Mrs Harwood, who was the daughter of an English barrister and wife of a highly distinguished professional man. The evening was a success, and Mrs. Clayton felt doubly proud of her own importance. The next day she was married to Mr. Clayton, and the pair moved to a new home.. Mrs. Marygold was at a party at the home of Mrs. Harwood. She met Mrs. Lemmington, Florence, and many others with whom she was not acquainted. Among them were two young ladies who seemed to attract general attention. They were not showy, chattering girls, such as in all companies attract a swarm of shallow-minded youug fellows about them. There was something retiring, almost shrinking in their manner, that shunned rather than courted observation. And yet, no one, attracted by their sweet, modest faces, found himself by their side that did not feel inclined to linger.. ""Ah, Mrs. Lemmington! how are you?"" said a lady, coming up at this moment. ""I have been looking for you this half hour."" Then, passing her arm within that of the individual she had addressed, she drew her aside before she had a chance to answer Mrs. Marygold's question. A gentleman handed Melinda to the piano, and there was a brief pause as she struck the instrument, and commenced going through the unintelligible intricacies of a fashionable piece of music. After she had finished her task, she left the instrument with a few words of commendation extorted by a feeling of politeness. ""My sister sings, I do not,"" was the modest reply, ""but I will take pleasure in accompanying her"" The first few touches that passed over the keys showed that the performer knew well how to give to music a soul. The tones that came forth were not the simple vibrations of a musical chord, but expressions of affection given by her whose fingers woke the strings into harmony. But if the preluding touches fell witchingly upon every ear, how exquisitely sweet and thrilling was the voice that stole out low and tremulous at first, and deepened in volume and expression every moment, until the whole room seemed filled with melody! Every whisper was hushed, and every one bent forward almost breathlessly to listen to the voice.. The sisters, feeling at length that many must be wearied with their long continued occupation of the piano, felt themselves compelled to decline further invitations to sing. No one else ventured to touch a key of the instrument during the evening. And when, at length, both voice and instrument were hushed into silence, no enthusiastic expressions of admiration were heard. But only half- whispered ejaculations of ""exquisite!"" ""sweet!"" ""beautiful!"" Then came earnestly expressed wishes for another and another song, until the sisters felt atlength that manymust be wearies with theirLong continued occupation.. ""Surely those are not Clayton's daughters!"" ejaculated Mrs. Marygold, in surprise. ""They certainly are ma'am,"" replied Mrs. Florence in a quiet but firm voice. ""I have discovered them to be a rather uncommon kind of people,"" she added. ""Almost any one can thrum on the piano; but you will not find one in a hundred who can perform with such exquisite grace and feeling as they can,"" she said. ""Their father is nothing but a schoolmaster,"" said Mrs. Lemmington. ""For half an hour this evening I sat charmed with their conversation, and really instructed and. ""Take them all in all,"" added Mrs. Lemmington with warmth, ""you will find nothing common about them"" ""Except their origin,"" half-sneeringly rejoined Mrs. Marygold. ""Can any of us boast a higher origin?"" ""True,"" replied Mrs. Florence. ""There are various ranks among women"" ""True"" replied Mrs Marygold, ""but they were born of woman."" ""True. True,"" said Mrs. Lemmington, ""and true, too, that they are not really classed with common people in the true acceptation of the term"" ""I cannot say as much for any other young ladies in the room, for there are none. ""No, ma'am,"" replied Mrs. Marygold, drawing herself up with a dignified air. ""I have no wish to cultivate their acquaintance, or the acquaintance of any persons in their station"" ""I am surprised that Mrs. Harwood has not had more consideration for her friends than to compel them to come in contact with such people,"" said Mrs. Clayton. ""Mere position in society does not make any of us more or less a true woman,"" said the Duchess. ""The rank is but the guinea's stamp, The man's the gold for a' that."" ""You will be charmed with them, I know, and equallycharmed with their mother when you know her."". ""Henry Florence has not been here for a week,"" said Mrs. Marygold to her daughter Melinda. ""No; and he used to come almost every evening,"" was Melinda's reply, made in a tone that expressed disappointment. The reason of her concern arose from the fact that both had felt pretty sure of securing Henry Florence as a member of the Marygold family--such connection, from his standing in society, being especially desirable.. Henry was talking to his mother about Miss Marygold. His mother said that there was something too common about her. She said that her character had been formed by external accretions from the common-place, vague, and often too false notions of things that prevail in society. Henry said that she was speaking in riddles, and that he did not like it. He said that he thought she was a mere made-up girl. The conversation went on for a long time, and Henry was very interested. He was very fond of his mother, and she of him.. ""She is no common girl, Henry,"" Mrs. Florence said, in a serious voice. ""She has not her equal in my circle of acquaintances"" ""Nor in mine either,"" replied the young man, recovering himself. ""Say on."" ""I can point you to one."" ""O yes, I have met her,"" said the young woman. ""Fanny Clayton!"" ejaculated the young boy. ""OYes, I've met her."" ""Say. on"" ""I've met Fanny Clayton,"" said Mrs. Clayton. ""You have met. her?"". Henry Florence married Melinda Marygold. He addressed her as Fanny Clayton. Mrs. Marygold was not happy with the choice. She was upset that a ""common kind of girl"" like Miss Clayton would be forced into genteel society. Henry Florence and Fanny were married in April. The wedding was held in the family home. The couple had a son, who was born in May. The marriage was announced in June. The engagement was announced on July 4, 1828. The ceremony was held at the home of Henry Florence, in the garden of his parents. The reception was held on July 11, 1827. The bride was a daughter of a wealthy family.. Melinda Marygold had no kind feelings for her successful rival. She had too much regard to what was due to her station in life. As for Melinda, she had no very kind feelings at all for her rival too! A mere schoolmaster's daughter! She hesitated not to speak of her often and in no very courteous terms.Gradually, however, as the younger Mrs. Marygold grew in stature, she could perceive any thing even passable in the beautiful young bride. She was almost stunned by the repeated and earnestly expressed congratulations to Mrs. Florence at the admirable choice made by her son, and that too by those whose tastes and opinions she dared not dispute. She managed to smother her indignation so far as, at length, to make up her mind to be present at. Melinda was married about a year after Fanny Clayton's wedding, to a sprig of gentility with about as much force of character as herself. This took place on the same night that Lieut. Harwood led to the altar Mary Clayton, the sister of Fanny, who was conceded by all, to be the loveliest girl they had ever seen. As for Lieuts Harwood, he was worthy of the heart he had won. Florence, in the process of time, took her true position in the social circle, even Mrs."

The least said about such things the better"" ""But, Mrs. Grimes, are you very sure. ""I was so confounded that I couldn't say a word. Indeed, I could hardly look her in the face"" ""And you really think, then, that she meant to keep the three yards without paying for them?"" ""Oh, certainly!"". ""I never speak evil of my friends, for it always does more harm than good"" ""So do I. Of course you will not repeat it."" ""I hope Mrs. Comegys thought better of the matter, upon reflection"". Mrs. Florence was entertaining Mrs. Grimes with gossip. Mrs. Comegys said she had seen something that amazed her beyond every thing. She said she would be astonished when she heard what Mrs. Florence thought.. ""I could hardly believe my eyes against Mrs. Comegys' integrity of character,"" said Mrs. Florence. ""And I thought I knew her, too, but it seems that I was. ""Perhaps there is something wrong here,"" said Mrs. Grimes. ""How do you mean?"" asked the friend. ""You've heard of people's having a dishonest monomania?"". ""I shall certainly not speak of it, Mrs. Grimes. It is too serious a matter"" ""I can never feel toward Mrs. Comegys as I have done"" ""We should never think lightly of dishonest practices"". A friend of Mrs. Raynor told her about Mrs. Comegys. She had been accused of keeping lawn more than she had paid for. The friend said she would not speak of the matter again.. ""Is it possible? I must say that Mrs. Grimes has been very indiscreet"" ""Yes. She told me that she was present when the lawn came home, and saw Mrs. Comegys measure. The story was that Mrs. Comegys had cheated a dry goods dealer out of several yards of lawn. The most common version of the story made it fifteen or twenty yards. Mrs.Comegys remained in entire ignorance of what was alleged against her. ""I do not feel quite comfortable in mind, certainly, though I don't know that I have any serious cause of uneasiness"" ""It is nothing more nor less than that I was coolly cut by an. ""I have never spoken of her to any one, except in terms of praise,"" he said. ""What can. ""She looked me in the face, and nodded with cold formality,"" Mr. Comegys said. ""I could not do otherwise, for I look upon her as one of the most. ""I don't know. I have a kind of independence about me which says, 'Let people think what they please, so you are conscious of no wrong.'"" ""Indifference to the world's good or bad opinion. ""It is our duty to take all proper care of our reputations, even to the sacrifice of a little feeling in doing so,"" writes the Duchess of Cambridge. The Duchess of Cornwall's husband, Prince Harry, is accused of assaulting a woman.. Mrs. Markle inclined her head slightly. ""I see that I was not mistaken in supposing that there was a marked coldness in your manner at our last meeting,"" she said. ""Of course there is a cause for. ""It is said that you bought a dress at a dry goods store in this city, and that on its being sent home, there proved to be some yards more in the piece of goods than you paid for,"" said Mrs. Comegys. ""Instead of returning what was not your. Mrs. Comegys sat for the full space of a minute with her eyes upon the floor, without speaking. When she looked up, the flush that had covered her face had gone. Rising from her chair, she bowed formally, and without saying a word, withdrew. Mrs. ""I did not mean to infer that you would. I believe that what you said in regard to Mrs. Comegys was the fact."" ""It certainly was. But then, it will do no good to make a disturbance about it"". ""I cannot associate on intimate terms with a woman who lacks honest principles"" ""Mrs. Comegys has already called upon me to ask an explanation of my conduct wards her"" ""I. ""She asked the author of the charge, and I named you."" ""Oh dear, Mrs. Markle! I wish you hadn't. ""Did she look guilty?"" he asked. ""You would have thought so, if you had seen her"" ""She sat with her eyes upon the floor for some time, and then rose up, and without uttering a word"". Mrs. Comegys had been on friendly terms with Mrs. Markle, and had even visited her. Mrs. Grimes was deliberately hypocritical, but she had a free tongue, and, like too many in society, more cautious about what they said than she.. Mrs. Markle, could do no less than call as she had been desired to. She rang the bell at Mrs. Comegys' door, and was shown into the parlor. About twenty ladies, most of them acquaintances, assembled.. Mrs. Markle: ""I learn from several sources, that the report originated with Mrs. Grimes, and that she has been very industrious in circulating it to my injury"" Mrs. Raynor: ""Did she mention the subject to you, Mrs. Come. ""Was it mentioned to you, Mrs. Florence?"" proceeded Mrs. Comegys. ""It was, ma'am,"" replied Mrs. Wheeler. ""By Mrs. Grimes?"" "". ""Telling it to a thousand is not half as bad as doing it, Mrs. Comegys,"" she said, angrily. ""You needn't try to screen yourself from the consequences of your wrong doings. Mrs. Grimes looked confused, and stammered out, ""I do not now exactly remember"" Mrs. Raynor: ""She said there were three yards."". ""I asked you what you meant to do with it, and you replied, 'keep it, of course' Do you deny that?"" asked Mrs. Markle. ""It is very likely that I did say so, for it was. ""You remember my buying this lawn dress at your store?"" said Mrs. Comegys. ""Yes, ma'am,"" said the store owner. ""I was very much hurried at the time when you bought it, and in measuring it off, made a mistake against myself. The young man bowed and withdrew. The ladies immediately gathered around Mrs. Comegys, with a thousand apologies for having for a moment entertained the idea that she had been guilty of wrong. ""I have but one cause of complaint against you all,"" said the injured lady.. A great deal was said by all parties, and many apologies were made. Mrs. Grimes was particularly humble, and begged all present to forgive and forget what was past."
0.25,0.35,22.703639514731368,"A lady sat reading. A beautiful girl, elegantly attired for an evening party, came in. The lady looked at the maiden with a lively interest. She thought the make up splendid--the effect striking. The maiden said, ""Say on, aunt Helen"". Alice unclasped, with a faint sigh, one of the bracelets, and laid it on her aunt's bureau. She asked her aunt: ""You think me overdressed. I see it in your eyes."". ""The critic's task is never for me a pleasant one, Alice. Least pleasant when it touches one I love"" ""May be you're right, I'll take the hair bracelets instead. And now, what else?"". ""It is quite plain, aunt Helen,"" said Alice, her color much heightened, ""that you have set me over to the side of those who study effect and court admiration"" ""I think you are in danger of going over to that. ""Indeed, indeed, aunt Helen, you are too severe in your tastes! We are not Friends"" ""You are not going in the character of a May queen, Alice, that you should almost hide your beautiful hair in ribbons and flowers"" ""A stiff bouquet in a silver holder is simply an imped. ""You had best refer to your mother. Her taste and mine may not entirely accord,"" said her aunt. ""Don't go as you are, if you can possibly make important changes. What time is left?"". Alice withdrew, silent, almost hurt, though not offended, and more than half resolved to give up the party. She pushed open the door of her aunt's room half an hour afterwards with this sentence on her lips. Her cheeks were glowing, and her eyes full of sparkles.. ""I am not overdressed."" Alice smiled. ""In my eyes you are a hundred times more attractive than you were, and will prove more attractive to all whose favor is worth the winning"". Alice felt sober. If she entertained doubts touching her change of dress they were gone now. She looked for the presence of one who had been, of late, much in her thoughts. She apparelled herself with that studied effect which received so little approval from her aunt Helen.. Alice had been seated only for a little while, when she saw the young man to whom we have just referred. He was standing at the extreme end of the room, talking in a lively manner with a gayly-dressed girl, who seemed particularly pleased with his attention.. ""I was coming like a butterfly, but my aunt Helen, who is making us a visit, objected so strongly that I took off my party dress and head-dress, made for the occasion, and, in a fit of half-don't-care desperation, got myself up"". ""He has spied you out already. You are the attraction, of course, not me,"" said Alice. Mr. Benton, who had been, of late, so much in her thought, now stood bowing before the two young ladies, thus arresting. ""You had a pleasant evening judging from your face,"" said aunt Helen, when she meet her niece on the next morning. ""Yes; it was a very pleasant one--very pleasant."". ""No it has not hurt my prospects,"" Alice replied. A visit from Mr."

Mary said: ""There is nothing I despise so much as a heartless woman of fashion"" Henry Grove said he thought better of his sister. Mary responded: ""Such an individual is certainly, not much to be admired, Henry"" Henry said he was sorry, and Mary said she was proud of her sister. The pair were married the following year. The couple had a daughter, Mary, and a son, Henry.. ""A fashionably dressed woman need not, of necessity, be heartless"" ""You needn't try to beat me off by ridicule, Mary. I am in earnest"" ""Where there is not much head, it seems to me there is never a superabundance of heart"" ""Nonsense! Don't look so grave. What I say is true"" ""I am condemning this blind slavery to fashion"" ""No, Mary, I do not."". ""I am sure I never examined a plate of fashions in my life"" ""You follow the fashion as much as I do"" ""Why do you have your lappels made to roll three button-holes instead of two?"" ""I beg your pardon, sir."" ""It is a fact"" ""I don't believe a word of it"" ""If you have not, your tailor has for you, many a. ""Because, I suppose, its now the fash--"" ""No, but Mary, that's the tailor's business, not mine."" ""There's father's old coat, made, I don't know when, that roll but two"" ""I choose to see if the f fashion suits my stature, shape, and complexion"" ""You trust to him to make you. ""I should be very sorry, indeed, if your deductions were true in regard to my following the fashions so blindly, if indeed at all,"" Henry said. ""I don't care a fig for the fASHions, Mary!"" rejoined Henry, speaking with some warmth. ""Then why do you wear fashionable clothes?"" ""I never think about them,"" Mary replied. ""And so I mean."" ""I am too bad,"" said Henry. ""Indeed, Mary, you are too bad."" ""Yes, I am,"" said Mary, ""and I am very sorry"" ""Yes,"" replied Henry, ""you are, too bad!"". ""You are an incorrigible follower of the fashions!"" ""I know it is, now that it is fashionable to do so."" ""It is, though, in fact."" ""Really?"" ""Yes, really."" ""I remember very well when you wore them, but they are out of fashion!"" ""You would not have me affect singularity, sister?"" ""I would have you continue to follow the fASHions as you are now doing"" ""I'm not sure I want to"" ""You're not sure you want to?"" ""No, I'm not."" ""You are not?"" ""Not at all."" ""What do you mean?"" ""You don't want to know?"" ""Well, I don't."". ""I hold it to be morally wrong to follow the fashions. They are unreasonable and arbitrary in their requirements"" ""I would like to see you willing to allow me the same privilege"" ""And there is one other thing that I would like in you"" ""What is that?"" ""I'd have you dress like other people"" ""That's right. I would have you wear a dress."" ""What?"" ""That would be fine."" ""I'll wear a suit."" ""Oh, that's fine. That's fine"" ""But what about the way you dress?"" ""What about the manner in which you wear it?"". Henry Grove and his sister called in to see uncle Absalom and aunt Abigail, who were of the old school, and rather ultra-puritanical in their habits and notions. ""I think that they can both prove to you beyond a doubt that it is a most egregious folly to be ever changing with the fashions,"" he said. ""Do so, and I will give up the point. Do so and I'll avow myself an advocate of fashion,"" said the aunt. ""We will see,"" was the laughing reply. ""You may do that probably; but certainly not to ours,"" replied the uncle. ""And I think that I can prove to them that they are not at all uninfluenced by the fickle goddess,"" he added.. Mary could not but feel, as she came into their presence, that it would be rowing against wind and tide to maintain her point with them. Nevertheless, she determined resolutely to use all the weapons, offensive and defensive, that came to her hand. The contest was not long delayed, for Henry, feeling that he had powerful auxiliaries on his side, was eager to see his own positions triumph. The welcome words that greeted their entrance had not long been said, before he asked, turning to his aunt, ""What do you think I found on Mary's table, the other day, Aunt Abigail?"" ""I don't know, Henry. What was it?"" Mary replied. ""You will be surprised to hear,--a fashion plate!"" Henry replied. Mary replied, ""I was studying it in order to conform to the prevailing style of dress"". ""Why, what harm is there in following the fashions, aunt?"" Mary asked. ""A great deal, my dear. It is following after the vanities of this life. The apostle tells us not to be conformed to this world."" Mary asked, ""But what has that to do with the f fashion?"" ""He says: 'But be ye transformed by the renewing of your minds' That elucidates and gives force to what goes before,"" aunt Abigail replied. ""So I think, clearly upsetting your position. Hadn't you a better opinion of her?"" Mary said. ""I certainly had,"" was the half smiling, half grave reply. ""But that is clearly what he means, Mary."". ""Then you understand him wrong, Mary,"" uncle Absalom spoke up. ""If he had meant that, he would have said it in plain terms"" ""I am not disposed to excuse my adherence to fashion upon any passage that allows of two interpretations,"" he said. ""I argue for it upon rational grounds."" ""Fashion and rationality! The idea is absurd, Mary!"" said uncle AbsAlom. ""Be ye not as the world, lovers of self more than lovers of God--but be ye transformed. ""You remember the celebrated John Wesley--the founder of that once unfashionable people, the Methodists?"" Mary asked. Uncle Absalom shook his head. ""They are antipodes,"" he said. ""Not by any means, uncle, and I think I can make it plain to you."" ""You can't do it,"" Mary said. 'I can."" ""I can't,"" he replied. ""I'm sorry. I can't."" ""They're antipodes."" 'I know. I'm sorry."" 'They're not antipodes. They're just people. They don't like fashion.' 'They don't?' 'No, they don't. They just don't.'. ""Fashion and comfort hardly ever go together,"" says Mary. ""There you are mistaken, aunt,"" says her uncle. ""Those fashions which are most comfortable, are most readily adopted by the largest numbers"" ""Make mine loose. Make mine loose."" ""What do you think of that, uncle? Do you see no rationality there?"". Mary's aunt Abigail was shocked by her daughter's admission. ""I adopt a great many, certainly, for no other reason than because they are fashionable,"" she said. ""For shame, Mary, to make such an admission! I really thought better of you."" ""But don't you follow the fashions, aunt?"" Mary asked. ""No, not eagerly, aunt."" ""Why Mary,"" exclaimed both uncle Absalom and her brother, at once. ""Why do you follow them so eagerly?"". Mary asked her uncle Absalom a question. ""Me follow the fashions? Why, what can the girl mean?"" he asked. Mary replied: ""I can prove to her satisfaction and yours, too, that aunt Abigail is almost as much a follower of the f fashion as I am"" ""For shame, child!"" he said. ""I don't take much notice of such things"" Mary replied. ""But I can though, uncle; so prepare yourself to be convinced"". ""I believe she has changed the pattern of her cap a good many times,"" says Mary. ""I can prove it,"" says aunt Abigail. ""Yes I can, and I will. Don't you remember when the high crowns were worn?"" ""Of course I do,"" replies Mary. But I believe I have changed them, too,"" she adds.. ""Why didn't you think so before,"" asked Mary, looking archly into the face of her aunt. ""O, I can tell you, so you needn't search all over the world for a reason. It was because the high crowns were fashionable. Come out plain and aboveboard and say so."" ""I won't say any such thing."" ""Then what was the reason?"" ""Every body wore them, and their unsightly appearance had not been made apparent by contrast"" ""Exactly! They were fashionable!"" ""Exactly!"" ""But when a new fashion laughed them out of countenance, you cast them aside, as I do. Mary's brother was surprised at the turn the conversation had taken, not expecting to see Mary carry the war home so directly as she had done. ""I could go on and prove to your satisfaction, or at least to my own, that you have followed the fashion almost as steadily as I have,"" she said. ""Don't you think so, Henry?"" ""I have sufficiently made out my case,"" he replied. ""You are a very clever woman, and I am sure you will do well to follow her example"" ""I will do my best to follow your example,"" she replied.. Mary asked her uncle Absalom about the use of the buttons on his coat. He gave a reluctant response, but said that they were of some use. Mary then asked about the two flaps at the bottom of the skirt. He said they were used to give strength to that part of the coat, he said. Mary said she didn't know what they were for, but that she thought they were useful. He replied that they gave strength to the coat. Mary replied that he was right, and that she had no idea of their use. She then asked him about the buttons. He told her they were to help with the strength in the coat's bottom. Mary thought this was a strange explanation.. ""You might as well be out of the world as out of fashion,"" said Henry Grove to his sister. ""You change as well as we do--but slower,"" said Abigail. ""Didn't I make out my point? Didn't I prove that they too were votaries of the fickle goddess?"" ""I think you did, in a measure,"" said his sister, ""and in a good measure too"" ""You are as much a part of our state of mind as we are of our,"" replied Henry Grove. ""And old people feel this as wellas young."" ""And you are right,"" said the girl, ""you are right."". ""I don't see clearly how I can do that, notwithstanding all that has passed to-night,"" he said. ""No matter. Convinced or not convinced you will still be carried along by the current,"" he replied. ""The fashion of dress that prevails may not be the true exponent of the internal and invisible states,"" he added. ""They must necessarily be modified in various ways by the interests and false tastes of such individuals as promulgate them"" ""I am not certain that I can enlighten you fully on the subject,"" he continued, ""but think that I may, perhaps in a degree, if you will allow my views their proper weight in your mind."" ""I will try to do so; but shall not promise to be convinced,"" he concluded.. ""Why should we blindly follow these fashions?"" ""We need not blindly"" ""That is singular"" ""But is it not true?"" ""Perhaps it is"" ""Still, this does not affect the primary cause."" ""That I never do."" ""But, surely, you do not pretend to say that all fashion are becoming?"" ""That's not true"" ""Perhaps"" ""I'm sure that I do not blindly follow them."" ""I never do"". ""You follow the fashions. But how do you account for it?"" ""I think but little about them, Mary"" ""I do not wish to be singular"" ""A man who affects any singularity of dress or manners, loses his true influence in society"" ""If fashion be followed from no higher view than a selfish love of being admired, then the feeling is wrong"" ""It is right or wrong, according to the end in view"" ""Can we follow fashion with any other end?"" ""Yes, we can"" ""But is it a right feeling?"" ""No, it is not."" ""Why?"" ""For this reason, I do not dress like that."". ""A right attention to dress looks to the development of that which is appropriate and beautiful to the eye"" ""I could present this subject in many other points of view. But it would be of little avail, if you are determined not to be convinced."" ""I am not so determined, Mary. What you have already said, greatly modifies my view of the subject"" ""A right Attention to Dress Looks to the Development of That which isappropriate and Beautiful to the Eye"" ""We should adopt prevailing usages and fashions, if not immoral or injurious to health."" ""We must not ridicule your adherence to fashion, if I do not give much thought to it myself."" ""A very strong and just argument why we should adopt ... fashion"" ""Fashions are the badges by which we are known--diplomas which give to our opinions their legitimate value"" ""They are a universal benefit"". ""But fashion is not always so directed by true taste"" ""A just remark"" ""Change in fashion, so far as they present new and beautiful forms, new arrangements, and new and appropriate combination of colors"" ""So far do they tend to benefit society"" ""The true and the beautiful here as in other branches of art"" ""All who have a right appreciation of the truly beautiful should give some attention"""

""Bless me, child!"" ejaculated old Uncle Joseph, in surprise. ""You were there last year."". ""There was not a day in which we were not crowded down to the table among the most vulgar kind of people,"" said Mr. Jones. ""I cannot say that I have any clearer idea of what you mean, Emily,"" said his wife. ""Saratoga is a place of public resort,"" was the quiet reply. ""Well, genteel people will have to stay away, then, that's. Florence Ludlow was fifteen; light-hearted and innocent. Purity of heart, and the genuine graces flowing from a truly feminine spirit, always attracted her. She had never been able, thus far in life, to appreciate the exclusive principles upon which her mother and sisters acted. She frequently fell under their censure.. ""And I trust she will ever remain the child she is, in these matters,"" said Uncle Joseph. ""It is the duty of every one, sister, to do all that he can to set aside the false ideas of distinction prevailing in the social world,"" he added. ""In this way, and in no other, can you be thrown so into association with 'all kinds of people,' as to be really affected by them,"" he said.. ""I don't see that there is any use in our talking about these things, brother"" ""Well, well, never mind,"" replied his brother. ""I think you incline to be rather low in your social views"" ""How can that be a low view which regards the quality of another, and estimates him accordingly?"" ""I'm not sure,"" replied the brother, ""that it's a very good question. ""I'll do my best to bring him round,"" says Emily. ""We will drop them,"" says her father. ""I won't say anything more,"" she says. ""It's a matter of principle,"" he replies. ""You can't force people to do things."" ""I can't,"" she adds. ""They're not going to do anything."". ""If you hold these sentiments, you are unworthy of such a man as your father!"" said Mrs. Ludlow. ""I shall always speak my thoughts in your house Margaret,"" was the reply; ""at least to you and the girls"" ""I don't know that he has such very good reasons, beyond his reluctance to go away from business,"" said Emily. Emily Ludlow asked her father to go to England with her. He said he didn't want to go, and that he would rather stay at home. Emily replied: ""As far as Mr. Ludlow is concerned, I have rarely occasion to differ with him"" The pair went to England, and returned with a new understanding of each other.. ""You are wrong to talk so, Emily,"" said Mr. Ludlow. ""If you don't wish to go, I suppose no one will quarrel with you for staying at home."" ""I cannot leave my business so long as such a journey would require,"" he said. ""I do not think it altogether right for me to indulge you in such views and feelings as you and Adeline are beginning to entertain"". ""I do most decidedly condemn the spirit from which you are now acting,"" said Mr. Ludlow. ""You certainly cannot wish us to associate with every one,"" said Emily, in a tone less arrogant. ""It hurts your self-importance to be brought into brief contact with them,"" he added. "" Wealth and station in society do not give moral tone. They are altogether extraneous"". ""This man's character I esteem far above that of many in society to whom no one thinks of objecting,"" he said. ""Do you suppose that I would enjoy less the pleasures of a few weeks at Saratoga, because Thomas was there?"" ""I would, rather, be gratified to see him enjoying a brief relaxation, if his duties at the store could be remitted in my absence"". ""I can't think of going to Saratoga,"" said Emily, in a positive tone. ""We must go somewhere this summer, and Pa seems in earnest about not letting us visit London."" ""Victorine told me so this morning,"" said Adeline. ""She did!"". ""As it will never do to stay at home, we will have to go somewhere,"" said Emily. ""The Lesters, and Milfords, and Luptons are going,"" said Victorine.. ""I think that I am not going there, to be jolted half to death in a stage coach by the way,"" said Mr. Ludlow. ""Victorine said,"" remarked Adeline, ""that a large number of distinguished visiters were to be there, and that it was thought the season would be the gayest spent for some time"". Emily and Adeline were going to go to Saratoga. Mr. Ludlow was not able to go with them. Emily asked him if he could go. He replied that he could not go until next week. Emily said they should go then. Mr., Ludlow said he could.. ""O, but indeed you must lay aside business,"" said Mrs. Ludlow. ""It will never do for us to stay at home, you knows during the season when everybody is away"" ""I shall be very sorry if circumstances arise to prevent you having your regular summer recreation,"" was replied, in a serious, even sad tone. ""But, I trust my wife and. ""Perhaps I have reason for so doing,"" he responded, a shadow flitting across his face. ""But three or four hundred are not much, Pa,"" Emily urged, in a husky voice, and with dimmed eyes. ""Within the last six weeks I have lost, beyond hope, at least twenty thousand dollars,"" he said. ""Under these circumstances, I am driven to the necessity of prudence in all my expenditures"". Mr. Ludlow was a very rich merchant. His wife became impressed with the idea, that, because she was richer, she was better than others. She believed only such customs were to be tolerated in ""good society,"" as were different from prevalent usages in the mass. Mr Ludlow felt deeply tried, and for some moments his resolution wavered; but reason came to his aid, and he remained firm.. Mrs. Ludlow, Emily, and Adeline, closed up the front part of the house, and gave directions to the servants not to answer the door bell, nor to do anything that would give the least suspicion that the family were in town. All except Florence were exceedingly distressed at this. She acquiesced with gentleness and patience, although she had much desired to spend a few weeks at Saratoga.. Ludlow was compelled to submit to all this, and he did so without much opposition. As to his sister and nieces, he was indignant, and failed to gain admittance by way of the front door. He kept his promise for a few weeks, at least. He was determined not to go near his sister or his niece, and to avoid the penalty of losing his place in the society.. Mary Jones was a very beautiful woman. She attracted attention at the Springs. This had been one cause of Emily's objection to her. She was sitting near a window of the public parlor of one of the hotels. A young man, named Armand, whom she had seen there several times before, in company with Emily Ludlow, with whose family he appeared to be on intimate terms.. Mary Armand and her daughter Florence are not going to visit the Springs this season. The reason is that Florence's father has met with heavy losses in business. ""It will certainly be a kind act, Mr. Armand, and one, the motive for which they cannot but highly appreciate,"" said Mary. ""And so do I, most sincerely,"" replied Mr.Armand.. ""Who can it be?"" he asked himself. He waited for a long time. The door was closed. The bell rang again. But no one came. He went back to his room. He cried out, ""I've been waiting for you all this time!"" The door opened again. The man was not there. He had gone to the door.. ""I would not have him know that we are in town for the world!"" she said. ""I can't understand you,"" said Mr. Armand. ""Why, the truth is, Mr. Armand, if you had ringing for a quarter of a century, it would all have been the same"" ""I would have been happy to hear that,"" said Mrs. Arden.. Emily Ludlow cannot go to the Springs with them this season, and they are so afraid that it will become known that they are burying themselves in the back part of the house, and denying all visiters. ""It provokes me out of all patience with them,"" says Mr. Armand. ""I cannot comprehend it,"" says Emily's father. ""They are so silly, as to fear that they will lose caste, if it is known"" ""It's a. Armand could remember many things in her conversation and conduct that he did not like. He could distinctly detect a degree of self-estimation consequent upon her station in society. The more he saw of her, the more he admired her winning gentleness, sweet temper, and good sense. When he returned to New York, he was more than half in love with her. Mr. Armand has not been to see us once this fall,"" said Adeline, one evening in October.. Ludlow's affairs had become so embarrassed, that he determined, in spite of the opposition of his family, to reduce his expenses. This resolution he carried out amid tears and remonstrances--for he could not do it in any other way. ""Who could expect him to come here?"" Emily replied, to the remark of her sister. ""Not I, certainly."". ""I saw him there last evening--and he sat conversing with Mary in a way that showed them to be no strangers to each other"" ""I don't believe it!"" said Emily, with emphasis. ""Just as you like about that. Seeing is believing, they say, and as I have seen him there, I can do no less than believe he was there."" ""When did you see him there?"" Emily now asked with eager interest, while her face grew pale. ""When. Adeline feared that he might have despised the principle from which they acted, in thus shutting themselves up, and denying all visiters. It was evident to her, that it was not their changed circumstances that kept him away--for had he not visited Mary Jones? Uncle Joseph came in a few evenings afterwards.. ""Brother, why will you talk so? I am out of all patience with you!"" said Mrs. Ludlow, angrily. ""No one knows better than you, that I speak only the truth,"" said Mr. Jones. ""Would you be really any worse, were your father a mechanic?"" said Mrs Ludlow. ""Yes, I would,"" replied Mr. Lud. ""These high-minded young ladies, who sneer at mechanics, are themselves a shoemaker's daughters,"" said Uncle Joseph. ""I hope you will hereafter find it in your hearts to be a little more tolerant of mechanics daughters,"" he said. The mother could not deny the allegation he had made, but said she was not surprised by the remark.. Mrs. Armand and Mary Jones, the watchmaker's daughter, had softened and subdued their tone of feeling. Their conduct at the Springs was far less objectionable than it had been heretofore. Emily Ludlow and her sister Adeline felt honored rather than humiliated by an association with them."

He is too much ashamed of his conduct while in my store"" ""Better that many suffer, than that one innocent man should be condemned and cast off"" ""It was fully proved that this young man robbed.

""I wouldn't trust him,"" said the neighbor. ""He did take a little from me; but it wasn't much, and there were peculiar circumstances"" ""I am most grievously disappointed in him,"" replied the neighbor, ""I always try to think the best of every one"". ""I never believed that he would turn out so badly"" ""It was simple justice. He could not have done otherwise"" ""A rogue is a rogue, whether it be for a pin or a pound"" ""No one is bound to do that. It is cruel, and no one is under the necessity of being cruel"".

""If the law is good, it must be because its effect is good,"" said Mr. May.. ""Punishment, if ever administered, should look to the good of the offender"" ""What good disgracing and imprisoning a young man who has all along borne a fair character, is going to have, is more than I can tell"" ""It would not be kindness to wink at his errors and leave him free to continue in the practice"". ""No one errs on the side of kindness,"" he said, ""while too many, by an opposite course, drive to ruin those whom leniency might have saved"" ""Would you have believed it?"" was Mrs. May's quick and excited answer.

I charged it at once upon her, and she burst into tears, and owned that she was going to take the money and keep it."".

She doesn't remain in this house a day longer"" ""It is bad enough to. ""It's rather a serious matter to break down the character of a poor girl,"" says Ella.

""I hope I shall find, in Jane, a nurse to my liking,"" said the lady. ""I certainly hope so,"" replied Mrs. May. ""She is a pretty cool piece of goods, I should say,"" said her husband. ""But then, you know, perfection is not to be attained any where"". ""I could hardly contain myself when the lady told me that she wanted her to nurse a little infant. I thought of dear Charley, and how she had neglected and abused him--the wretched creature! But I restrained myself, and gave her as good a character as I could"" ""We should not let our indignant feelings govern us in matters of this kind. We. Jane Campbell was the nurse of a baby boy. The baby was taken to sleep with her. She was neglectful of the baby. She also lost money and jewelry. She did not suspect any thing was wrong with her nurse. She thought she was honest, or she would have been notified of the fact by Mrs. May, of whom she had inquired Jane's character.. Jane's patience was tried severely. The child cried for several hours at a time all night. It was scolded, shaken, and even whipped by the unfeeling nurse. Sleep threw its protecting mantle over the wearied babe. The baby's mother asked Jane, ""How did you get along with Henry?"". Henry screamed for several hours the next night. Jane felt an affection for the child, and, from that affection been led to soothe it with tenderness, might easily have lulled it into quiet. But her ill-nature disturbed the child. After worrying with it a long time, she threw it from her with violence.. Jane Campbell awoke in the night to find her child had not cried at all. She looked anxiously at the child's face, and it reassured her. The child soon fell away into sleep. Mrs. Campbell went over to the room where Jane slept. She found both the child and nurse asleep. She kissed them both softly and left.. Jane Campbell looked into the face of Henry, and something about it troubled her. There was something in the atmosphere of the room that oppressed her lungs. She stood for several minutes looking at the child, and then left the room. Mrs. Campbell returned an hour later, and said that Henry had been sleeping sound.. Jane turned away from the penetrating glance of the mother, and remarked, indifferently: ""He has been worried out for the last two nights. That is the reason, I suppose."" Mrs. Campbell said no more, but lifted the child in her arms, and carried it to her own chamber. There she. ""Nothing,"" was the positive answer. ""Somebody has been giving it a powerful anodyne, that is certain. This is no natural sleep"" ""We are afraid the nurse has."" ""Where is the nurse?"" ""Let me see her."". The child was poisoned by a vial of laudanum and a spoon. Doctor B---- tried to save the child, but his efforts were in vain. At day dawn on the next morning the flickering lamp went out.. ""Dreadful! What have they done with her?"" ""She can't be found, I am told"" ""I didn't believe she was wicked enough for that"" ""Though it is true she ill-treated little Charley, and we knew it"".

0.85,0.95,66.57391304347826,"Wealth gave Mrs. Caldwell leisure for ease and luxurious self-indulgence. Some minds, when not under the spur, sink naturally into, a state of inertia, from which, when any touch of the spur reaches them, they spring up with signs of fretfulness. The wife and mother, no matter what her condition, who yields to this inertia, cannot escape the spur. Children and servant, excepting all other causes, will not spare the pricking heel. Order in a household, and discipline among children, do not come spontaneously. But for the misfortune of having a rich husband, she might have spent an active, useful, happy life. It was the opportunity which abundance gave for idleness and ease that marred everything. It is a pity she had such a husband, as he would have made her a better woman.. Mrs. Caldwell's brow was clouded. It was never, for a very long time, free from, clouds, for it seemed as if all sources of worry and vexation were on the increase. To make matters worse, patience was assuredly on the decline. In all lives are instructive episodes, and interesting as instructive. Let us take one of them from the life of this lady, whose chief misfortune was in being rich. She failed in the creation of that order in her family without which permanent tranquillity is impossible. It is the result of wise forecast, and patient, untiring,. The face of a girl in her seventeenth year, on which sat no very amiable expression, was presented at the door. Little things, once scarcely observed, now give sharp annoyance, there being rarely any discrimination and whether they were of accident, neglect, or wilfulness. The voice of her daughter answered, half-indifferently, from the next room. ""I'm not hurting the cloak, mother,"" answered Phoebe, coolly. ""Just see how you are rumpling that cloak! What do you mean?"" asked her mother, sharply.. ""Don't talk to me in that way, Phoebe! I'll not suffer it. You are forgetting yourself."" Mrs. Caldwell said. ""What is that on your front tooth?"" she asked. ""A speck of something, I don't know what; I noticed it only yesterday."" ""What's that?"" ""I don't want to know,"" the girl replied. ""It's just a speck."" ""That's all it is,"" the mother replied. 'I'm sorry,' the girl said, ""I didn't mean to offend you."". ""It's only a speck,"" said Phoebe, evincing little concern. ""Decay, as I live!"" said Mrs. Caldwell. ""You must go to the dentist immediately. If your teeth are beginning to fail now, you'll not have one left in your head by the time you're twenty-five"" ""Why, it means that the quality of your teeth is not good,"" said the dentist. ""One speck is only the herald of another. Next week a second tooth may show signs of decay, and a third in the week afterwards"" ""This is too bad! The fact is, you are destroying your health,"" replied the doctor.. ""Mother! mother!"" replied Phoebe, ""don't fret yourself for nothing. The speck can be removed in an instant."" ""But the enamel is destroyed! Don't you see that? Don'tyou see that?"" ""I don't believe that follows at all,"" answered Phoe be, ""And even if I believed in the worst, I'd find more comfort in laughing than crying."" And she ran off to her own room. She saw the beauty of Phoe Be, a few years later in life, most sadly marred by broken or discolored teeth. She was most sadlymarred by a broken orDiscolored Teeth.. The stain was on a rich figure in the carpet. The color of this figure was maroon, and the stain, in consequence, distinct. Looking at that, and that alone, it magnified itself into a calamity. Mrs. Caldwell heard a carriage stop in front of the house. She looked out the window and saw that it was on the opposite side of the street. The carriage had stopped on the other side of a road. The driver had stopped to pick up a passenger. The passenger was Phoebe Caldwell, the daughter of the owner of the property. She had lost her teeth in a fight with her mother. The house had been in disarray. The stains were on the carpet, and were very distinct to her eye.. Mrs. Caldwell was not even honored by a call! This was penetrating the quick. What could it mean? Was she to be ruled out of this lady's set? The thought was like a wounding arrow to her soul. To be second to her, touched the quick of pride, and hurt. Only a card was left. Then the lady reentered her carriage. Even so. Mrs. Caldwell did not feel the highest regard for her neighbor opposite. She was very unhappy. She felt that she had been left out of a coveted honor. The lady-queen of fashion, so much courted and regarded, might really think most highly of her neighborosite.. Mrs. Caldwell's daughter's careless habits, the warning sign of decay among her pearly teeth, the stain on a beautiful carpet, and, worse than all as a pain-giver, this slight from a magnate of fashion;--were not these enough to cast a gloom over the state of a woman who had everything towards happiness that wealth and social station could give? Slowly, and with oppressed feelings, she left the parlors, and went up stairs. Half an hour later, as she sat alone, engaged in the miserable work of weaving out of the lightest material a very pall of shadows for her soul, a servant came to the door, and announced a visitor. It was an intimate friend, whom she could not refuse to see--a lady named Mrs. Bland.. ""Now, don't you think I am beset? Why, Mrs. Bland, I'm in a purgatory of your own creating"" ""My advice is to come out of it as quickly as possible,"" said Mrs. Caldwell. ""Will you show me the way?"" asked Mrs. Bland. ""At some other time perhaps,"" replied Mrs Caldwell, ""but this morning I have something else on hand"" ""I've called for you to go with me on an errand of mercy,"" said the friend. ""And I'll take you with me,"" said Mr. Caldwell, ""and I'll show you the way."". Mary Brady is in trouble,"" said Mrs. Bland. ""Her husband fell through a hatchway yesterday, and came near being killed."" ""I pity her from the bottom of my heart,"" replied Mrs. Caldwell. ""Put on your things, and let us go and see her at once."" ""A leg and two ribs broken, I believe"" ""Nothing more, but that is a very serious thing, especially where the man's labor is his family's sole dependence"" ""The escape was miraculous."" ""The man's life is in danger."" ""It is never a pleasant thing to look other people's troubles directly in the face"" ""It's not a very pleasant thing for persons to look others' troubles directly. Mary Brady had been a faithful domestic in her mother's house for years. Mrs. Caldwell was moved by a sense of duty and a feeling of interest in Mrs. Brady. The two women went to the house of Mary Brady, who was in a state of despair. The story was told in a novel called ""The Last House on the Peculier Road"" (1962) The novel was written by the English author,   William Makepeace Thackeray. The novel is about a young woman's visit to her mother-in-law in a nursing home. It is also about the death of Mrs. Brady's son, who had been in the care of her mother for many years. The book was published by the London-based publisher, The London Review of. ""How is your husband, Mary?"" she asked with a solemn face, as soon as they had entered. ""He's quite comfortable to-day; and it's such a relief to see him out of pain"" ""There are no internal injuries, I believe,"" said Mrs. Bland. ""None, the doctor says. And I'm so thankful"" ""When I think how much worse it might have been, I am condemned for the slightest murmur that escapes my lips"" ""What are you going to do, Mary? What will you do?"" asked Mrs. Caldwell. ""I don't know,"" replied Mrs. Brady, ""but I'm going to wait and see."" ""What will you say to your husband?"" asked the doctor. ""What would you like to say to him?"" ""I just want to say that I'm. ""A woman's wit and a woman's will can do a great deal,"" says Mrs. Brady. ""Your husband won't be fit for work in a month, and you have a good many mouths to fill"" ""I'm a quick sewer, and not afraid but what I can earn,"" says Mary Brady. 'Where there's a will, there's an way,' Mrs. Caldwell says. ""I've found that true so far, and I reckon it will be true to the end"" ""You beat me out!"" says Mary, ""and I can't understand it."" ""You're a good sewer,"" says the tailor. ""And I'm a good tailor."" ""And, dear knows, he's a right to have it, for he's worked hard, and with scarcely a holiday, since we. ""Your secret is worth knowing, Mary,"" said Mrs. Bland. ""There's always a bright side as well as a dark side, and I'm sure it's pleasant to be on the bright side, if we can get there"" ""I've had no time to be troubled,"" replied Mrs. Brady, drawing, almost for shame, a veil of sobriety over her face. ""I expected to find you overwhelmed with trouble, but, instead, you are almost as tranquil as a June day."" ""I don't get opportunity to look on the dark side of things. And what would be the use? There'salways a bright and dark side,"" said the woman.. ""I am rebuked,"" she said; ""rebuked, as well as instructed"" Mrs. Caldwell: ""I've no time to be troubled, and so trouble passes on to some other that stands ajar"" ""Nor, may be, could the wisest philosopher that lives,"" returned that lady. The two friends, after promising to furnish Mrs. Brady with an abundance of lighter and more profitable sewing than she had obtained at a clothier's, departed. For the distance of a block they walked in silence. Mrs Caldwell spoke first. ""I can't give any better explanation, Mrs. Bland."" ""I'm sorry,"" said Mrs. Carr, ""but I can't help it. I've been a little. ""I wish it were engraved in ineffaceable characters on my heart,"" said Mrs. Bland. ""My cheek burns at the remembrance,"" said the friend. ""Shut it, and bar it, my friend!"" answered Mrs Bland, ""and when trouble knocks, say to her, that you are too busy with orderly and useful things"" ""Don't speak of them. Throw to the winds such light causes of unhappiness as were suffered to depress you this morning, and they will be swept away like thistle down,"" she said. ""I least expected to receive a lesson there,"" replied the friend, ""above all places in the world. Above all places, I leastexpected to receive one."" ""I must shut and bar the door!"" said Mrs Bland.. ""Come, good, true, kind friend!"" Mrs. Bland said. ""Let true thoughts and useful deeds fill all your hours. This is the first lesson. Well in the heart, and all the rest is easy."" The new life she strove to lead, was easy just in the degree she lived in the spirit of this lesson, and hard just inThe new life was easy in thespirit of the lesson. It was hard in the degrees of her departure, and the degree of her leaving. ""Give yourself no time for trouble,"" said Mrs. Caldwell, with a tender, encouraging smile."

""I want to raise enough to buy them a ton of coal, a barrel of flour, a bag of potatoes, and a small lot of groceries,"" he said. ""To relieve the wants of our suffering fellow creatures is an unquestionable duty,"" replied Mr. Prescott, ""but there is another important consideration connected with poverty and its demands upon us"" ""What is that pray?"" inquired Mr. Jonas. ""It is the first duty of humanity to relieve them,"" said the merchant, quite warmly. ""And, as you are a benevolent man, I hope to get at least five dollars here in aid of a. ""If a man is hungry, give him bread; if he is naked, clothe him,"" said Mr. Jonas. ""This family I learn, are suffering for all the necessaries of life, and I can clearly see the duty to supply their wants"" ""How it shall be done,"" answered Mr. Prescott, calmly. ""There is no room for doubt or question here"" ""Temporary relief"" was the reply. ""Tem temporary relief"" is the answer. ""I don't know anything about him. I only know that hunger and. ""For which I honor your kindness of heart, Mr. Jonas. So far you acted right. But, I am by no means so well assured of the wisdom and humanity of your present action in the case"" ""The true way to help the poor, is to put it into their power to help themselves. The mere bestowal of alms is, in most cases, an injury"" ""Every one has ability to serve the common good, and society renders back sustenance for bodily life as the reward of this service"" ""I shouldn't have slept last night, after what I heard, without just sending them a bushel of coal, and a basket of provisions"". ""True charity will provide employment for him rather than bestow alms"" ""How is he to serve society, for the sake of a reward?"" ""For all who are willing to work, in this country, there is employment"" ""Which will be best for them? To help them in the way you propose, or to encourage them to help themselves?"" ""Well, we'll not deal in general propositions; because anything can be assumed or denied"" ""I'm by no means ready to admit this assertion."" ""I'll be happy to hear your views on the matter"" ""You make a very extreme case. For all of us, it's a very serious matter"". ""I cannot give, understandingly, in the present case, and so must disappoint your expectations in this quarter,"" said Mr. Jonas. ""I don't believe much in the benevolence of your men who are so particular about the whys and wherefores,"" he added. ""All a mean excuse for not giving,"" said the man, as he walked away. ""Feed and clothe a man first, and then set him to work to help himself. He will have life in his heart and strength in his hands"" ""Good morning,"" pleasantly responded Mr. Prescott, as his visitor turned and left his store. ""Your time and mine are both of too much value during business hours"". Mr. Jonas called, happened to be very much of Mr. Prescott's way of thinking; and the next chanced to know something about the family for whom he was soliciting aid. ""A lazy, vagabond set!"" exclaimed the individual, when Mr. Jonas mentioned his errand, ""who would rather want than work. They may starve before I give them a shilling"" ""But can the man get work?"" inquired Mr.Jonas. ""Other poor men, who have families dependent on them, can get work. Where there's a will there's the way"" ""Downright laziness is the disease in this case, and the best cure for which is a little wholesome starvation"". Jonas was angry with the indigent family, and angry with himself for being ""the fool to meddle with any business but his own"" He said he would never seek to do a good turn again as long as he live. Mr. Caddy says he knows them like a book, and they'd rather want than work. With him, I think a little wholesome starvation will do them good."" Mr. Jonas said he was ""morally certain"" that they were a lazy, vagabond set.. ""I have just heard where the services of an able-bodied man are wanted,"" said Mr. Prescott. ""He won't work; that's the character I have received of him,"" replied Mr. Jonas. ""True charity to the poor is for us to help them to help themselves,"" he said. ""Mere alms-giving is demoralizing for the opposite reason. It blunts the moral feelings, lowers the self-respect, and fosters inactivity and idleness"" ""Charity is the only way to save a man's life,"" said the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. ""and to save the soul of a nation."" ""Chrismas are the only thing that can save a person's life, and save the nation's. Mr. Prescott urged the matter no farther, for he saw that to do so would be useless. On his way home, on leaving his store, he called to see Gardiner. He found, in two small, meagerly furnished rooms, a man, his wife, and three children. Everything about them indicated extreme poverty; and, worse than this, lack of cleanliness and industry. The woman and children had a look of health, but the man was evidently the subject of some wasting disease. He was very far from being the able-bodied man Mr. Prescott had expected to find. ""He's an idle good-for-nothing fellow, and I'll have nothing to do with him,"" said Mr. Jonas.. Mr. Prescott was a close observer, and saw, at a glance, the assumed sympathy-exciting face of the mendicant in each. As the latter stepped into the miserable room where they were gathered, the light of expectation, mingled with the shadows of mute suffering, came into their countenances. ""You look rather poor here,"" said he, as he took a chair, which the woman dusted with her dirty apron before handing it to him. ""Indeed, sir, and we are miserably off,"" replied the woman, in a half. ""Is that boy of yours doing anything?"" he inquired. ""No, sir,"" replied the mother. ""He's too young to be of any account"" ""Bad--bad,"" said Mr. Prescott, ""very bad"" ""Instead of which he is growing up in idleness, which surely leads to vice"" ""He has no clothes fit to be seen in at school,"" said the mother, ""but he's just a little over 13"" ""Very bad,"" said Prescott.. ""There is no excuse for dirt and disorder,"" said the visitor, more seriously. ""I once called to see a poor widow, in such a state of low health that she had to lie in bed nearly half of every day"" ""I never saw a neater room in my life than hers, and her children, though in very plain and patched clothing, were perfectly clean"" ""Yes sir, thank God! And if it wasn't for that, I don't know what we should all have done."" ""Everything has fallen upon me since John, there, has been ailing."". ""God helps those who help themselves,"" said the visiter. ""You need not expect gratuitous help from God"" ""You have not yet heard from him,"" said he. ""He promised more efficient aid to-day"" ""I am not a man of words,"" said Mr. Prescott. ""But I am a person of words."" ""You are not a people of words. You are people of ideas."" ""We are not people of money,"" he said. ""We do not have money to spend."" ""No, we do not,"" replied the woman, ""but we do have ideas"" ""We have ideas about how to help each other,"" said Prescott.. ""If I was only able-bodied,"" said Gardiner, in a half reluctant tone and manner. ""But you are not. Still, there are many things you may do"" ""Mr. Gardiner can help some, I do not in the least doubt,"" said Mr. Prescott. ""There will be no danger of starvation on this income, and you will then eat your bread in independence"" ""If you are all disposed to help yourselves, I will try to stand your friend. If not, I shall have nothing to do with you"" ""I speak plainly; it is better; there will be less danger of apprehension,"" said the man. ""I am one of those upon whom he called. Now, if you're all disposed, I'll try to help you."". ""But we can't get work,"" said the woman. ""I can tell you how to earn half a dollar a day for the next four or five days at least,"" replied the man. ""Put yourself in the way of useful employment, and you will have no difficulty beyond,"" said she. ""It's plain, then, that work is better than idleness,"" said he. ""Don't believe a word of it,"" said his wife. ""You don't see half that sum in a week now."" ""Yes, I do,"" replied he. 'I do,"" she replied. ""But you don't. You don't."" ""I don't believe it."". ""You shall be paid at the close of each day's work,"" said Mr. Prescott. ""A loaf of bread earned is sweeter than the richest food bestowed by charity, and far better for the health"" ""But about the boy, sir?"" said Gardiner, whose mind was becoming active with more independent thoughts. ""Rome was not built in a day, you know. First let us secure a beginning. If your wife goes to-morrow, I shall think her in earnest; as willing to help herself, and, therefore, worthy to be helped. Will you come?"" ""Yes,"" said the woman. ""All in good time,"" he replied. ""The rest will come in due order"". The Gardiners were a stout, strong woman, and knew how to scrub and clean paint as well as the best. When fairly in the spirit of work, she worked on with a sense of pleasure. Mrs. Prescott was well satisfied with her performance, and paid her the half dollar earned when her day's toil was done. On the next day, and the next, she came, doing her work and receiving her wages. The glow of satisfaction that pervaded the bosom of each member of the family, as Mr. Prescott visited them, was evident. ""Well this is encouraging!"" said he, with an expression of real pleasure, as he gazed around the room, which scarcely seemed like the one he had visited before. All was clean, and everything in order; and, what was better still, the persons of all,. ""I like to see this,"" continued Prescott. ""It does me good. You have fairly entered the right road"" ""There is worldly comfort and happiness for you at the end,"" he said. ""I have something in my mind that will just meet your case"" ""I think I have found a very good place for your son,"" he added. ""Walk on steadily, courageously, unweariedly"" ""You will be happy,"" said Prescott, ""and so will I."" ""I am happy to see you,"" said the boy. ""And I will see you again."" ""Yes,"" replied the father, ""I will be glad to seeyou again"". ""Sir!"" exclaimed the poor man, in whom personal pride and a native love of independence were again awakening, ""if you can do this for me, you will be indeed a benefactor"" ""It shall be done,"" said Mr. Prescott, positively. ""Did I not say to you, that God helps those who help themselves?"" ""No one, in our happy country who is willing to work, need be in want,"" said the man. ""Money earned by honest industry buys the sweetest bread"" ""What do you think of that?"" the man asked. ""I think it's a good idea. What do you say?"" ""I say it is a good thing. Mr. Prescott's way of helping the poor is the right way. They must be taught to help themselves. Mere alms-giving is but a temporary aid. Help a man up, and teach him to use his feet, so that he can walk alone. This is true benevolence. It is the basis of self-dependence, on which all should rest. Mr. Prescott is a friend of the Gardiner family, and has helped them in their time of need. Mr Prescott is also a former mayor of the town of Prescott,"

All around him he saw young men yielding to the pressure of temptation and stepping aside into evil ways. But they were weak and vicious, while he stood firm-footed on the rock of virtue!. The author of ""The Art of War"" was a friend of George III's. He was a member of the Royal Family, and was the son of a former president. He wrote that he had been a friend to George III, and that he knew him as a friend.. Mr. Bland was sitting with a cigar in his mouth, and a glass of ale beside him. He was reading with the air of a man who felt entirely satisfied with himself. Bland said: ""I never drink anything stronger than ale"" ""Liquors are so drugged nowadays, that you never know what poison you are taking,"" he added.. Martin Bland and his friend Green were talking about Booth's Cardinal Wolsey. The two young men were strangers to Green. Bland said he'd like to read a few of the best passages in Wolsey's part.. The party followed a waiter up stairs, and were shown into a small room, neatly furnished, though smelling villanously of stale cigar smoke. A few passages were read from Shakspeare, then drink was ordered by one of the the party. The reading soon gave way entire to the comments, which, in a little while, passed from. After the supper, cigars were introduced, and after the cigars, cards. A few games were played for shilling stakes. Bland expressed surprise, but accepted the entertainment as quite agreeable to. Martin Green was a successful gambler. He lost a hundred and fifty dollars. His friend, Mr. Bland, arranged for him to lose the money. Green lost the money, and was appalled by the loss. The loss was a serious and embarrassing matter for Green.. Martin Green's employer called him the next day. The man was the last man on the earth he desired to meet. Green's friend of the evening before had called to ""arrange that little matter"". ""Do you know that young man?"" asked Mr. Phillips, the employer of Green, as the latter came back to his desk. ""His name is Bland,"" said Green. ""He merely dropped in. It was a simple loan, you. ""I am glad to know it, sir,"" Martin had the presence of mind, in the painful confusion that overwhelmed him, to say, ""and shall treat him accordingly."" He went back to his desk, and resumed his work. The evil spirits that lure a man from virtue never counsel aright when to seek to return. They magnify the perils that beset. ""Man's extremity is the devil's opportunity,"" says Shakespeare. Green had a number of collections to make on that day, and his evil counsellors suggested his holding back the return of two of these, amounting to his indebtedness, and say that the parties were not yet ready to settle their bills. This would enable him to get rid. ""I gave your young man a check for a hundred and five dollars,"" said Mr. Phillips. Martin's face flushed deeply, and then grew very pale. The suddenness of this question so confounded Martin, that he. ""Heaven is my witness, sir,"" answered the young man, with quivering lips, ""that I have never wronged you out of a dollar, and had no intention of wronging you now"" ""Sit down, Martin,"" said Mr. Phillips. ""If you had not gone into the way of temptation, the betrayer had not found you,"" was the remark of Mr. Phillips, when the young. ""Would you think it good for him, as he emerged from youth to manhood, to visit refectories and billiard saloons?"" ""No, sir, I would do all in my. ""It will ruin me,"" Bland said. ""Bland will denounce me,"" said Mr. Phillips. ""You are in my power, and must submit,"" said the villain. Bland bowed and left.. The officer, who had been sitting with a newspaper in his hand, now gave his paper a quick rattle as he threw it aside. The mild, pleasant, virtuous aspect he could so well assume was gone, and he looked more like a fiend than a man. In pictures he had seen eyes. Bland stood, with an irresolute air; then, clutching desperately at a pen, he dashed off a receipt, and was reaching for the money, when Mr. Phillips drew it back. ""Either take theMoney, or go. This is not. Martin Green was a clerk at Phillips' office. He had been spotted by a gang of villains. The officer warned him to stay away from the gang. Martin Green left the office, but could not trust his employer. A year later, Phillips lost his job. The gang were still at large.. ""We pity him, but cannot blame his employer,"" says the author. ""He had been very circum"
0.85,0.95,70.87824351297405,"The Larkin family lived in a small town in New York state. The Larkin's had a store in the town of Millard. Their son, Sanford, rode a spirited horse. Mrs. Larkin said of Sanford: ""He is dashing far beyond his ostensible means"" She wondered at Millard for keeping him in his store. But Millard was too unsuspicious, and too ignorant of what was going on out of the narrow business circle. He is like a horse in a mill. He sees nothing outside of a certain limit. He spends it as freely as water. He rides past here almost every Sunday afternoon, and often in company with Harriet Meadows. They say money with him is no consideration. He spending it as free as water."" ""Strange that his employer does not see this!"" said Mrs Larkin.. ""Some one ought to give him a hint"" ""It would be a charity"" ""Why do n't you do it?"" ""Oh, it's none of my business"" ""Let Millard look after his own affairs"" ""If he neglects to do so, he deserves to be cheated by them"" ""I do n' know"" ""But some one should"" ""Some one should."" ""But why do you not do it"" ""Because it would be charity."" ""Because some one ought"" ""To see into the habits of his clerks"" ""And if he neglect's to do that, he deserve to be cheating by them."" ""It is his place to see into his clerks' habits"" ""He knows as little as the man in the moon"" ""So what?"". ""I do n't think he is fit company for Harriet Meadows,"" said Mrs. Larkin. ""Nor I,"" returned her husband. ""I should be very sorry to see our Jane riding with him, or indeed, associating with him in any way."" Surely Harriet's father and mother cannot know that their daughter rides out with him almost every Sunday afternoon,"" said Ellen. ""If it were my child I would take it as a great favor indeed,"" said Mr Larkin, ""but I'm not going to do it. It's no affair of mine"" ""Some one ought to give them a hint upon the subject,"" said Harriet's mother. ""It would be a good turn, no doubt. But I'mnot going to doing it,"" said the father, ""it's no matter."". ""I never interfere in other people's business. Every one ought to look after his or her own concerns"" ""Well, just as you like,"" returned Mr. Larkin, indifferently. ""Let every one see that his own stable door is locked before the horse is stolen"" ""I hate your meddlesome folks. I 'll take good care that my own child do n't form such associations"" ""Letevery body else do the same. The fact is, parents are too careless about where their children go, and what kind of company they keep"" ""No harm could come of your just giving Mrs. Meadows a hint."" ""Oh, no indeed! It's none of my business."" ""I'm not sure what you're talking about, but I'm sure you're right"".  Sanford's habits were bad, and his associates often of a vicious character. Bad habits and bad associates always involve the spending of money freely. To supply his wants his salary proved insufficient. These wants were like the horse-leech, and cried continually--"" give, give."" They could not be put off. At length, as new wants pressed upon him, he was tempted to exceed in his borrowed money account the sum received as his quarterly dues. He was always behind hand just the amount of three months' salary. But he was able to get along for two or three quarters of his income. But, of course, he could only get along by borrowing just the Amount of Three months' Salary. He had to borrow again from some friends immediately, and curtailing his expenses down to the range of his Income. He could only do this for a few weeks. He then had to pay back the entire quarterly receipt to balance his borrowed account.. In balancing the cash account one day, Sanford found that there was an error of one hundred dollars in favor of cash. This made it impossible for him to pay off, when he received his instalments of salary, the whole amount of borrowed money. Sanford was vexed that the error had been found out, for he had already nearly made up his mind to keep the overplus and say nothing about it. He had already began to think of quietly appropriating the surplus. He found the error to consist in the carriage of tens--four instead of five having been carried to the third or column of hundreds on one of the pages of the cash book, thus making the amount called for in the book one hundred less than the real sum on hand. Sanford sat at his desk in a state of abstraction and irresolution. He was almost made up to keep his overplus, but decided to keep it and not say anything about it at all.. Sanford made a deliberate false entry in the bank account. He did not attempt to change the erroneous figure. He knew that no one but himself and Mr. Millard had any thing to do with the general cash account of the establishment. Sanford paid off a portion of what he owed, and retained the rest to meet the demands that would be made upon him before the arrival of the next quarter day. It was a rule with Millard to pay off his clerks only in quarterly instalments. No other payments were allowed them. Sanford made another false entry, by which another hundred dollars passed into Sanford's pockets. He paid off one hundred dollars, and kept the rest for the time being. He then paid off the rest of the money owed to his clerks. Sanford then paid the rest into his pocket, at least for the present. He left the bank with a sum of one hundred and a half dollars.. Sanford was inspired with a wish to own a horse himself. A beautiful animal just at this time came under his eye. He looked at the animal again and again, rode him out, talked about him, until, finally, the desire to own him became almost irresistible. The horse was purchased, and for a few days the thought of possessing so noble an animal was very pleasant. Mr. Sanford then wrote a false entry in the cash book to pay for the horse. On the third day after this act of dishonesty, Mr. Sanford was able to pay off the horse and get his money back. He was then able to spend the money on a new house and a new car. He then went on to buy a new horse, and the story was told in a book called 'The Horse and His Owner'. Sanford's heart gave a quick throb, but he controlled himself by a strong effort. Mr. Millard, who had been looking over the cash book, discovered the erroneous figures. ""Look here, Sanford,"" said he, ""you have made a mistake here. This figure should be nine instead of eight, and this five instead of four"" ""Yes, that's a fact. I'm glad you have found it out,"" said Sanford. ""Strange, after adding up these columns for some twenty times or more, I should have still been wrong in these figures,"" said Millard.. Sanford trembled from head to foot the moment his employer left him. He tried to make the corrections, but his hand shook so that he could not hold the pen. He then changed the erroneous figures. But this did not make the matter straight. The cash account now called for two hundred dollars more than the funds on hand would show. If the money should be counted before he could make other false entries, he would be discovered and disgraced. And now that errors had been discovered, it was but natural to suppose that Mr. Millard would glance less casually at the account than he had been in the habit of doing. He turned away from the desk and went to his office. He never looked back until he had finished his work. He was later found in his office, having changed his clothes and his hat.. The dishonest clerk was permitted to prosecute his base conduct undetected. Nightly Sanford attended places of public amusement, usually accompanied by a young lady, the daughter of some respectable citizen. Among those with whom he had become intimate was Harriet Meadows, a daughter of a merchant possessing a high sense of honor and considerable wealth. Mr. Meadows, so soon as the young man began to visit at his house, gave him to understand by his manner that he was not welcome. The young man's conduct was so skilfully concealed that no one but the eye of suspicion could have detected it. The clerk was allowed to continue in this way month after month until the defalcation rose to over a thousand dollars. He was finally caught when he erased a few pages back certain figures, and insert others in their places. He carried down from thence the error by a regular series of erasures and new entries. The dishonest clerk then continued to prosecute the base conduct.. The young man was flattered by the attentions of Harriet Meadows. She met him a few times at balls, and hesitated not to dance with him. Sanford determined that he would keep the daughter's company in spite of her crusty old father. The former had much, he thought, to hope for in in a union with Miss Meadows. Her father was well off, and in a very excellent business. His fortune would be made if he could rise to the position of his son-in-law. He did not hope to do this by a fair and open offer for Harriet's hand. The character of Meadows, which was decided, precluded all hope of gaining his consent after he had once frowned upon his approaches. This kind of intimacy soon led to a declaration of love on the part of Sanford, which he was fully responded to by the foolish girl. This was so plainly done that there was no room for mistake in the matter.. The only road to success was a secret marriage, and to that he was gradually inclining the mind of the daughter at the time our story opened. He was particularly intimate with one of Larkin's clerks, a young man named Hatfield, who had no higher views of life than himself. Hatfield found it necessary to be more guarded than Sanford, from the fact that his employer was gifted with much closer observation than was Millard. He, too, rode a fast trotting horse on Sunday, but he knew pretty well the round taken by Larkin on that day, and the hours when he attended church, and was very careful never to meet him. At some place of public resort, a few miles from the city, he would join Sanford, and together they would spend the afternoon. On Jane Larkin, his employer's only daughter, Hatfield had for some time looked with a favourable eye.. Harriet Meadows and Jane Larkin were particular friends, and soon became confidants. Sanford and Hatfield, as the reader has seen, were also intimate. In a short time after the latter had made up their minds to secure the hands of these two young ladies, if possible, there was a mutual confession of the fact. Hatfield would, on such occasions, ingeniously allude to this fact, and thus gather from Jane how she regarded their coldness. It was not agreeable to her, he quickly perceived. This encouraged him to push matters further. He would attend her to places of public amusement. But both himself and the young lady saw that even this was not a thing that fully met their approbation. The tacit opposition of the parents to their intimacy was a matter of conversation between them.. Harriet Meadows was riding out with Hatfield on Sunday afternoon. She was stopped by Larkin and his wife, who were concerned about their daughter. Mrs. Meadows said she would speak to Mr. Larkin about the matter. Hatfield and Meadows then came up with a plan to end their relationship. The plan was to kill Hatfield by stabbing him in the back with his own sword. The pair then went back to their homes and plotted the end of the relationship. They were eventually able to carry out the plan and end their affair. The murder was the first in the history of the IRA. The plot was inspired by a novel by Upton Sinclair, which was published in 1849. The novel was about the murder of a young boy by his father, who was a member of the mob.. ""If they don't, and she rides about with Tom, Dick and Harry on Sundays, they have no one to blame but themselves for the consequences,"" said Sanford. ""She is ready to go at any time that Jane is willing to take a similar step,"" he added. ""Oh yes--all her influence can be calculated upon,"" he said of Harriet. ""If she will only second me in urging the thing upon Jane, there can be no doubt of the result,"" Sanford said. ""And she will do that of course,"" Sanford replied. ""All right. That point we settled last night. She would rather not go all alone."" ""And how is Harriet?"" asked Sanford of his friend.. ""How do you think Larkin will stand affected after all is over?"" ""It's hard to tell. At first he will be as mad as a March hare. But Jane is his only child, and he loves her too well to cast her off"" ""I'm in debt three or four hundred dollars, and dunned almost to death whenever I am in the way of duns"" ""Give me a fair chance, and I'll turn a bright penny for myself"" ""How are you off for funds at this present time?"" ""Low, very low. The old fellow don't pay me half a salary."" ""I'll be as cosily fixed in the family as I could wish"". ""Can't you make a raise some how? We must both have money to carry out this matter"" ""And I have n't twenty."" ""Bad, very bad"" ""We must go off a hundred or two miles and spend a week."" ""And we may have to board for weeks at pretty high charges before a reconciliation can be brought about"" ""You ought at least to have a couple of hundred dollars."" ""I don't have any money."" ""You should have some money"" ""I have no money.""""And I haven't twenty"" "" bad, verybad"" ""Bad"" ""Very bad"". ""Borrow from Larkin! Goodness! He'd clear me out in less than no time, if I were to ask him to loan me even fifty dollars"" Sanford asked. ""Can 't you borrow it without his knowledge, I mean? No harm meant of course. You intend borrowing his daughter, you know, for a little while, until he consents to give her to you."" Hatfield looked into the face of his tempter with a bewildered air for some moments. He did not yet fully comprehend his drift. ""How am I to borrow without his knowing it? Figure me that out if you please"". ""Humph! Quite a casuist."" ""But is n't there reason in it?"" ""I do n't know"" ""You'll only be supporting his daughter out of his own money--that is all"" ""Humph!"" ""Quite a Casuist!"" ""H Humph! Quite an casuists."" ""Hump!"" ""What's the matter with you?"" ""What is the matter?"" ""It's just a little loan, that's all."" ""I don't know why I'm asking you to do it"" ""Why not?"" ""Because it's a good idea. ""You must have that sum at least, or to proceed will be the height of folly"" ""I am not exactly in a state to see reasons clearly just now"" ""It is owing to Larkin's mean pride that you are driven to this extremity"" ""He ought to pay for it."" ""The chance is fair enough"" ""How am I to get hold of two hundred dollars?"" ""That's the question"" ""We deposit some days as high as ten thousand dollars"". ""Miss a couple of tens in your additions on the debit side of the cash book. Two hundred won't be missed."" ""No, not until the cash is settled, and then it will come to light"" ""You may prevent it."" ""I think it does."" ""After Sanford ceased speaking, his friend cast his eyes to the floor, and reflected for some time"" ""There was in his mind a powerful struggle between right and wrong"" ""When the plan was first presented, he felt an inward shrinking from it. It involved an act of fraud, that, if found out, would blast his character"" ""After you come back, this can be set right again. No one will. ""But,"" he said, lifting his eyes and drawing a long breath, ""if it should be found out?"" ""Larkin will not expose his son-in-law for his daughter's sake."" ""True--there is something there to hope for. Well, I will think of it. I must have two hundred dollars from some source"" ""And he didThink of it to evil purpose"" ""Nothing occurred to prevent the acts proposed"" ""I will never forget you, Jane"" ""You will always be in my heart."" ""And I will always love you"". Harriet Meadows left her father's house at the time agreed upon, and joined young Sanford at an appointed place. The two couples then proceeded to the house of an alderman, who united them in marriage bonds. From thence they drove to a railroad depot, took passage for a neighboring city, and were soon gliding away. The absence of Harriet on the night following alarmed the fears and awakened the suspicions of her father and mother. Early on the next day, Mr. Meadows learned that his daughter had been seen entering the----cars in company with young Sanford. By false entries, Hatfield was enabled to abstract two hundred dollars in a way that promised a perfect concealment of the fraud, although in doing it he felt much reluctance and many compunctions of conscience. The young ladies' friends were unawakened in the minds of the young girls' friends.. Alderman who had married the couples was met accidentally. He testified to the fact of his having united them. When he again went out, he was met by the startling rumor that a defalcation had been discovered on the part of young Sanford to a large amount. Already false entries in the cash book had been found to the amount of at least five thousand dollars. An officer, he also learned, had been despatched to----, for the purpose of arresting the dishonest clerk and bringing him back to justice. ""Quite an affair this,"" remarked Larkin to an acquaintance whom he met some time during the day, in a half-serious, half-indifferent tone. ""About Meadows' daughter and Sanford? Yes, and rather a melancholy affair."" ""Quite a melancholy love affair,"" replied Larkin, ""about Meadows' girl and Sanford?"". ""I do n't care so much for Millard or his clerk as I do for the foolish girl and her parents"" ""I saw exactly how he was going on, and could have told him; but it wasn't any of my business"" ""They were together a good deal, and were frequently to be seen riding out on Sunday afternoons"" ""Still they should have looked more carefully after their child"" ""Her happiness is gone and theirs with it"" ""The worst part is, that the foolish young man has been embezzling the money of his employer"" ""Yes, that is very bad. But Millard might have known that Sanford could not dash about and spend money as he did upon his salary alone"" ""He is an unsuspicious man, and keeps himself quietly at home when not in his store"". Larkin turned instantly pale. Hatfield had been away since the morning of the day before, and his daughter was not at home. A call upon Alderman----confirmed the afflicting intelligence. The father returned home to communicate the news to his wife, on whom it fell with such a shock that she became quite ill. ""He might have known that something of this kind would have happened,"" remarked the person who had communicated the intelligence, as soon as Larkin had left. ""I always keep myself clear from these matters,"" said Larkin. ""It was n't any of my business. I knew it and could have told them how things were going--but it was n' any ofMy business"". Sanford left the city, and has not since been heard of. Hatfield was received on the principle that, in such matters, the least said the soonest mended. In the course of a few months he was able to restore the two hundred dollars he had abstracted. After this was done he felt easier in mind. He did not, however, make the foolish creature he had married happy. The two brides were of course included. ""No man who does n't wish his daughters to marry his clerks, ought to let them go to balls and concerts together, and ride out when they please on Sunday afternoons."" ""I could have given him a hint on the subject, if I had chosen--but it was none of my business."". ""They seem united, but internally they are not conjoined,"" says the author. ""Too plainly is this apparent to the father and"

""O, if they wouldn't sell him liquor, there'd be no trouble! He's one of the best of men when he. Lizzie, a little girl, not over ten years of age, sat listening attentively. After a while she went quietly from the room, and throwing her apron over head, took her way, unobserved by her mother.. The tavern kept by Jenks, the laziest man in Milanville,--he was too lazy to work, and therefore went to tavern-keeping,--stood nearly a quarter of a mile from the poor tenement. ""Good water, that of yours, landlord,"" said the stranger. ""Is it?"" was returned, somewhat uncourteously. The stranger poured out a tumbler of water, and drank it off with an air of satisfaction.. Leslie's landlord says he has forgotten how it tastes. ""Ah, this is a sad confession--one which the angels might weep to hear,"" he says.. ""There must be something wrong here if a man may not speak in praise of water without giving offense"" ""I said you could adjourn your lecture!"" ""I didn't think any one had so strong a dislike for water as to consider its praise an insult"" "". The child's step was elastic, her manner earnest, and her large, dark eyes bright with an eager purpose. Her little face was flushed, and great beads of perspiration were slowly moving down her crimson cheeks. She. ""Off, I say!"" shouted Jenks, now maddened beyond self-control. The stranger caught her in his arms, exclaiming, as he did so, with deep emotion, ""God bless the child!"". ""Come, Lizzie, dear! This is no place for us,"" said Leslie, breaking the deep silence. ""Wait, papa; wait!"" she said. ""He hasn't promised yet"". ""Promise her, in Heaven's name!"" said the stranger. ""If I do promise, I'll keep it!"" returned Jenks, in a threatening tone.. Lizzie's mother, Ellen, says that her husband has promised to never sell her another glass of liquor. ""God be thanked! There is hope for me yet,"" she says.. A year later a stranger came again that way, and stopped at the ""Stag and Hounds"" As before, Jenks was behind his well-filled bar, and drinking customers came and went in numbers. Jenks did not recognize him until he called for. ""Do you see that little white cottage away off there, just at the edge of the wood? Two tall poplars stand in front."" ""I do. What of it?"" he answered. ""Aha! I see! Well, did Leslie, as you call him, ever try to get a drink here, since the landlord promised never to let him have another drop?"" ""Twice to my knowledge.

""Because it's the only way to attract attention,"" says the man who creates a sensation.. Caroline smiled as she answered, ""We must dazzle if we would win"" ""Show me an exception,"" Melvina said. ""Your friend Caroline, as. Caroline Gay could not help smiling at her friend's light bantering. She felt inclined to be serious in consideration of the false views of life that were influencing the conduct and affecting the future prospects of one, whose many good qualities of heart, won her love. ""If I should get off,"" she said, ""with one of those quiet gentlemen you allude to, it will be about the height of my expectation"". Caroline's friend Melvina was too much engaged in her own thoughts to respond to the maiden. ""I have set my heart on melting him down, and bringing him to my feet,"" she said. ""Perhaps I will, if it's only to see the effect of your demonstrations on the heart of Henry Clarence,"" said Melvine. ""But I'll disappoint them all, if there is power in a woman's winning ways to conquer,"" said Caroline.. ""If he is quiet, there is fire in him. I've seen his eye flash, and his countenance brighten with thought too often, not to know of what kind of stuff he is made"" ""O, as to that, all men have their weak side.

""That may be"" ""The grateful fellow will never forsake her"". ""I think I will, Melvina,"" she said. ""But, in all sincerity, I must say that I hope not."" ""I hope not, for I dislike singularity,"" he replied. ""How are you going to dress?"" ""Splendid, of course, as you expect to make a sensation"". ""I hope it will ever remain so, Melvina,"" said Caroline. ""A plain white dress, of India muslin."" ""Yes, white it shall be."" ""Among all you gay butterflies, I will become the observed of all observers"" ""Don't flatter yourself,"" said the girl.. ""No, not a flower, nor ribbon, nor cord, nor tassel."" ""You will be an object of ridicule."" ""No, my own dark hair, plain --"" ""For mercy sake, Caroline! Not plain."". Caroline: ""I am sorry that I shall be compelled to throw you so far in the shade, my little Quakeress friend"" Melvina: ""The world will never know half your real worth, Caroline. You are hiding your light"" Caroline: ""Of course, and what is more, I will succeed."". Caroline Gay was reading a book when Henry Clarence called in. He found her in the parlor reading. She sat almost motionless for nearly two minutes, and then rose up slowly with a slight sigh, and went to her chamber. Henry Clarence said: ""A good book helps us much sometimes."" The next day Caroline Gay was in the same room as Henry Clarence.. Henry Clarence and Caroline were reading a book together. The author of the book, Degerando, was not so abstract as Coleridge, he thought. He asked Caroline if she would also read the lighter works of the day. She said she would not pass them by. He said he would not lose much were he to do so. The book was a good one.. ""After reading Miss Sedgwick, our sympathies for our fellow creatures take a more humane range"" ""Her pictures, besides being true to nature, are pictures of home"" ""The simple beauty of Wordsworth has ever charmed me"" ""We are moved by an impulse to do good--to relieve the suffering"" ""Your discrimination is just"". ""I have read many things in the writings of these men that were exquisitely beautiful,"" she said. ""But I have never laid either of them down with feelings that I wished might remain"" ""We find little in them to deepen our sympathies with our fellows--little to make better the heart, or wiser the head"" ""How much of the good and true, like precious jewels set in gold, are scattered thickly over his pages!"". Caroline says she will go to Mrs. Walsingham's next week. ""I think it right to mingle in society, although all of its forms are not pleasant to me,"" she says. ""Wherever we go, into society, we come in contact with much that is good,"" she adds.. Henry Clarence was a friend of Melvina Fenton. He admired her, but could not conceal his admiration from himself. He could rarely spend an evening with Miss Fenton without a strong prepossession in her favor. Still, with her, as with every one, he maintained a consistency of character that annoyed her. He would often ask her, ""Is there not danger of our becoming dazzled by the false glitter?"". Henry Clarence was a cold man, and often felt under restraint in his society. He could not be brought to flatter her in any way. One thing in her which he condemned, was her love of dress. He would express a wonder to himself, how a young woman of her good sense and information could be guilty of such a glaring departure from true taste. She was skilful at acting, so even to deceive the keen eye of Henry Clarence. Fully resolved. ""I believe that I really love that girl,"" Henry Clarence said, on the evening before the party at Mrs. Clarence's house. ""I have discovered that, Mr. Clarence, and must thank you for the delight I have received, and I hope I shall continue to receive"" ""If you have a taste for his peculiar style of thinking and writing, you have in that volume an inexhaustible source of pleasure,"" he said.. ""She is certainly a beautiful girl."" ""I know of no one who, in comparison with her, bears off the palm"" ""She is affectionate, and that will make up for many deficiencies"" ""O, that is only a little fo. ""What do you think of Caroline Gay?"" asked his friend. ""Well, really, I can hardly tell what to think of her,"" he replied. ""She has intelligence, good sense, and correct views on almost every subject. But she is the antipodes of Melvina in feeling"". ""I want as perfect a woman as I can get."" ""You will have to take Melvina, then, for she has three exceeding good qualities, at least, overshadowing all others"" ""I should certainly hope so, were I going to link my lot with hers."". Henry Clarence felt his cheek burn and his heart bound with an indignant throb as he heard this remark. ""He will be disappointed, or I am mistaken,"" he said to himself as the two, who had been conversing near him, moved to another part of the room. ""But if Melvina Fenton has so little of that sensitive innocence, that shrinks from the presence of guilt as to dance with him, my mind is made up"". Henry VIII's wife, Melvina, was considered too showy for the wedding. Henry was not happy with her dress. He said he would never marry her. The wedding took place on September 14, 1858. The party was held at the White House. The event was attended by the king, queen, and other dignitaries.. Henry Clarence wandered around the room in search of Caroline--but he did not see her in the gay assemblage. ""Every other girl in the room will be dying of envy or neglect before the evening is over,"" he said. ""That would speak little for the gallantry of the men or the good sense of the young ladies,"" was the quiet reply. ""Oh! there she is, as I live, leaning on the arm. Caroline's head could boast but a single ornament, besides her own tastefully arranged hair, and that was a sprig of buds and half-blown flowers as white as the dress she had chosen for the evening. Her calm sweet face looked sweeter and more innocent than. Melvina knew his character well, and Henry Clarence was aware that she possessed this knowledge. His eye was upon her, and she knew it. She knew too well to accuse him of design. He was the same man alluded to as declaring that he would dance with her, as he always did with the belle of the ball room. She was the sweetest creature in the room by his side. He had joined the prom. Caroline Gay was dancing with Henry Clarence. She did not know of the determination that he formed or else she would have hesitated. She smiled an assent to his invitation to become his partner. He lingered near the group of dancers but a few minutes, and then wandered away to another room. He was the young man who had thus far monopolized the society of Caroline Gay. He had become too dull for her fair friend.. Caroline was admired by all. None wearied of her chaste, simple and beautiful attire. None looked upon her mild, innocent face, without an expression, tacit or aloud, of admiration. But I do not dance with every one. Clarence did not offer to dance with her once; and long before the gay assemblage broke up, her appearance had failed to produce any sensation. The eye tired of viewing her gaudy trapping.. Melvina had sought to produce a ""sensation"" by gay and imposing attire, and after a brief and partial success, lost her power. Caroline, with no wish to be noticed, much less to be the reigning belle of the evening, went in simple garments, and won the spontaneous admiration of all. Henry Clarence never, after that evening, could feel any thing of his former tenderness towards Melvina Felton. The veil had fallen from his eyes.. Melvina Fenton and Caroline Gay were alone in the chamber of the latter, in close and interested conversation. Melvina had signally failed in her well-laid scheme to take the heart of Henry Clarence. Caroline, with no such design, and in simply following the promptings of a pure heart and a right taste, had won his affection.. ""You are altogether mistaken, Melvina,"" Caroline said, with a serious air. ""I did not act a part on that occasion. I went but in my true character, and exhibited no other."" ""I had a great mind for a while never to forgive you,"" said MelVina. ""But all that is past, and I am wiser and better for it, I hope"". Melvina Fenton was married in 1852. Caroline Fenton served as her bridesmaid. Fenton's native grace accorded so well with her simple attire, that whoever looked upon her, looked again, and to admire her. She was eclipsed by Caroline, who was more beautiful for her simplicity. The couple were married in New York City.. Caroline was married in a week after, and then the fair heroines of our story passed from the notice of the fashionable world"
0.78,0.88,62.281879194630875,"Jonas Bebee has one merit, if he possesses no other, and that is, the merit of being able to make himself completely at home with all his friends. His good opinion of himself leaves no room for his imagination to conceive the idea, that possibly there may be, in his character, certain peculiarities not agreeable to all. It never occurs to him, that he may chance to make a mal apropos visit, nor that the prolongation of a call may be a serious annoyance. He is so entirely satisfied with himself that he is sure every one else must feel his presence as a kind of sunshine. His evening calls upon ladies generally produce a marked effect upon those specially selected for the favor.. The effect is most apparent in the parlor of a house. The servants are annoyed by a man in the room. The ladies are annoyed with him too. The effect is more pronounced in the kitchen. The men are annoyed at the ladies. The women are annoyed. The man is annoyed at them. The result is the effect of the scene in question. The character of the effect will appear in the following little scene, which we briefly sketch. The scene is called ""Gentleman in the Parlor. ""I hate the very sight of him!"" says one of the young ladies. ""So, come, let's put on the best face possible"" ""You can go, Cara, if you choose, but I'm in no hurry,"" says Mr. Bebee. ""No, you must all make your own apologies,"" says the servant. ""I'll be along in the course of half an hour,"" he adds. ""You must all be in good humor,"" says Cara. ""It's no use fretting ourselves over the annoyance, we've got to endure it."" ""I hate his very sight,"" says another, ""but I'm not in any hurry."" ""No,"" says a third, ""I'm in good humour."". Jonas Bebee is on familiar terms with all his friends, that he can waive all ceremony. If told that the lady is not at home, a suspicion that it may not be so does not cross his mind. He knows, as any one, that visits of politeness should be brief. But he generally does so, making himself ""at home,"" as he says, wherever he goes. He felt that he was neglecting her. So he started forth to make her a call. It was Saturday, and Mrs. Fairview was at home. She said she would be happy to see him. Mr. Bebee said he would be glad to see her. He said he had not seen her for some weeks.. Mrs. Fairview had been in the kitchen making cake. She came up to the parlor to dust and re-arrange some of the articles there a little more to her liking. She was about to leave the house, when some one rung the bell. Gliding noiselessly to the window, she obtained a view of Mr. Bebee. ""O, dear!"" she sighed, ""am I to have this infliction to-day? But it's no use; I won't see him!"" ""Hannah!"" called the lady, in a whisper, beckoning.. Hannah Fairview's mistress, looking more like a scarecrow than a genteel lady, was still in the parlor. The visiter was disposed to pass her by and make himself a temporary occupant of the same room. ""I'll just step in for a little while and enjoy myself,"" said the gentleman. ""It's a bitter cold day--perhaps she will be home sooner."" ""I don't think she will return before two o'clock,"" said Hannah, knowing that her mistress was still.. Hannah, the girl's mother, told her that her mistress would not come back until dinner-time. Mrs. Fairview, who had been eagerly listening to what passed between Hannah and the visiter, found that he was about invading her parlor, and seeing no way of escape, retreated into a little room, or office, built off from and communicating only with the parlor. As she entered this room and shut the door, the cold air penetrated her garments and sent a chill through her frame. In despair, Hannah ran back to her place in the kitchen, wondering what her mistress was going to say or do when Mr. Bebee found that she was at home--and, moreover, in such a plight!. The parlor had but a single door, and that one led into the parlor. There was no carpet on the floor of this little box of a place, and it contained neither sofa, chair, nor anything else to sit upon. Escape, therefore, was cut off, entirely; and to remain long where she was could not be done except at the risk of taking a severe cold. The prospect was, that he would thus remain ""at home,"" for at least the next half hour, if not longer. What was she to do? The thermometer was almost down to zero, and she was dressed for a temperature of seventy. ""I shall catch my death a cold,"" she sighed, as the chilly air penetrated her garments.. Mrs. Fairview saw Mr. Bebee in front of the roaring grate, rocking himself in the great arm-chair, and enjoying a new book which he had found upon the table. Five, ten, fifteen, twenty minutes elapsed--but there sat the visiter, deeply absorbed in his book. A certain feeling in the throat warned her that she was taking cold, and would, in all probability, suffer from inflammation of the windpipe and chest. But Mr. Beebe did not move from his place. He was far too comfortable to think of that. At last after remaining in prison for nearly an hour, Mrs. Fair View was released.. Mrs. Fairview, who by this time was beginning to suffer, besides excessive fatigue, from a sharp pain through her breast to her left shoulder blade, determined to make her escape at all hazards. Throwing an apron over her head and face, she softly opened the door, and gliding past her visiter, escaped into the hall, and ran panting up stairs. Mr. Beebe raised his head at this unexpected invasion of the parlor, but on reflection concluded that the person who so suddenly appeared and disappeared was merely a servant in the family. About an hour afterwards, finding that Mrs Fairview did not return, Mr.Beebe left his card on the table, and departed in his usual comfortable state of mind.. The lady was able to leave her room for three weeks before she was allowed out. Mr. Bebee called to congratulate her on her recovery. Two of her children were in the parlor; one eleven years old, and the other a child in her fourth year. The oldest of the two children, who understood in a moment what her little sister meant, whispered: ""H-u-s-h!--h-u/s/h! Mary!"" ""What am I naughty about, my little sis?"" said Mr. bebee. ""You made my mother sick, so you did! And mother says she never wants to look in your face again!"". ""Why, you shut her up in that little room there, all in the cold, when you were here and staid so long, one day. And it made her sick--so it did."" ""How did I do that?"" he asked himself. ""O, but you did,"" said the child. ""I didn't shut your mother up"" ""I'm ashamed of you,"" said Mr. Bebee. ""Come away."" ""I don't know what you mean,"" said his sister. ""You just shut her in that room."" ""No, I didn't,"" he said. ""But you did"" ""You shut her out of that room"" ""Yes, I did,"" she replied.. ""She told him that you said you never wanted to look upon his face again,"" said the little girl. ""She did!"" exclaimed the lady, in painful surprise. ""And she is telling him a great deal more. And she got cold, and almost died."" ""And so much for not being at home when you are,"" remarked a sister of Mrs Fairview. ""So much for talking before children!"" ""So, much for being a little witch!"" said the lady. ""It is too bad! I had no idea that the little witch knew anything"". ""So much for having an acquaintance who makes himself at home in your house, whether you want him or not"" ""No doubt you are both sufficiently well punished."" ""I have been, I know."" ""He's gone, I do believe!"" ""He never called again"" ""He was a good boy, and I'm glad to have him in my life"""
0.46,0.56,39.865675221875755,"Young love is pure and sweet. How little does it contain of earth--how much of heaven! No selfish passions mar its beauty. The deep, unswerving confidence of young love, what a blessed thing it is! Heart answers to heart without an unequal throb. Alas! this is an evil world, and man's heart is evil. From this dream there is too often a tearful awaking.. Baron Holbein had an only child, Nina, just fifteen years of age. For her sake, as well as to indulge his love of quiet and nature, he had retired from the world. For a time Nina missed her young companions, and pined to be with them. Her father urged her to go among the peasantry, and, as an inducement, placed a considerable sum of money at her command, to be used as she might see best in works of benevolence.. ""It is more blessed to give than to receive,"" said Jesus to his son. Jesus told his son, who had been given the gift of his life. Jesus said, ""It is better to be happy than to be rich"" Jesus was referring to the money given to him by his son to pay for his education. The money was given to the son of a woman who had given her life to her son. The son was given the money to help his son's education.. Nina told her mother she wanted to make a wise dispensation. Blanche said she would help her. She showed Nina around the village. Nina found a cottage where a mother and her daughter lived. She also saw a group of children playing in the green. Nina said she was ready to begin her work. She told Blanche: ""I will confide in your judgment. I will make you my almoner"". Nina and Blanche Delebarre visited Jennet Fleury at her cottage. Jennet was busy at her reel when they entered. She knew the lady of Castle Holbein, and arose up quickly and in some confusion. But she soon recovered herself, and welcomed, with a low courtesy, the visitors who had come to grace her humble abode. The two women then decided to set up a school in the village.. Nina said nothing to her father of what she was doing. She wished to surprise him some day, after every thing was going on prosperously. The school had not been in operation two days before the baron heard all about it. But he said nothing. He wished to leave her the pleasure which he knew she desired, that of telling him herself. The parents were willing to send their children, the teacher was willing to receive them, and the young lady patroness was willing. to meet the expenses.. Nina Holbein was a pupil of the Baron of Holbeins. She worked with the poor to set up a school for children. The Baron commended her for her good work. But she failed to give a full account of her work. She never returned to the Baron. He did not know why she did not give an account. He never asked her to do so again. But after that she continued to work for the poor.. Nina remained longer in her own room, alone, than she had done since their removal to the castle. Every day she went out, and almost always took the direction of Blanche Delebarre's cottage, where she spent several hours. The father could not understand the meaning of all this. He did not believe that any thing was wrong--he had too much confidence in Nina--but he was puzzled. He noticed a change in Nina. She was more thoughtful, and conversed less openly.. Nina Delebarre was alone in her cottage. Blanche had gone out to visit a sick neighbor at Nina's request. A form suddenly darkened the door, and some one entered hurriedly. Nina raised her eyes, and met the gaze of a youthful strange, who had paused and stood looking at her with surprise and admiration. The heart of the maiden fluttered. This, then, was Pierre Delebarrre, of whom his mother had so. Nina's blushes deepened, but she answered without disguise that she was from the castle. Let her come home and meet me here--the surprise will add to the pleasure. The young and artless couple did not talk of love with their lips during that time, but their eyes beamed with a mutual passion. When the mother entered, so much were they interested in each other, that they did not hear her approaching footstep.. Nina knew nothing of love before the beautiful youth stood before her. Her heart was as pure as an infant's--she was artlessness itself. Nina staid only a very short time after Blanche returned, and then hurried away from the cottage. She saw him, for the first time, as one to love. His face, his tones, the air of refinement and intelligence that was about him, all cons. Pierre left his uncle's house within twenty-four hours, with a fixed resolution never to return. All her fond hopes for her son were at an end. She looked at his small, delicate hands and slender pro- portions, and wept when she thought of a peasant's life of hard labor. A very long time did not pass before Nina made a proposition to Blanche, that relieved, in some measure, the painful depression under which she labored.. Pierre, the son of the baron, was a promising artist. His mother wanted him to spend a year in Florence, studying the art of the old masters. The baron refused, but his daughter took up the expedition and paid all the expenses. The son was never seen again by his father, and his daughter never gave accurate accounts of her charitable expenditures to him. He died a few years later, and was buried by his mother.. Pierre, the son of a peasant, asked the Baron Holbein for his daughter's hand. The old man was astounded. ""A peasant's love is as pure as the love of a prince,"" he replied. ""Your assurance deserves punishment,"" replied the baron, angrily. ""But go--never dare cross my threshold again!""Pierre retired, overwhelmed with confusion. He had been weak enough to hope that the Baron would consider his suit.. Nina's eyes drooped to the ground, and her lips remained sealed. ""Oh, father! he is not base! His heart is noble,"" replied Nina, speaking from a sudden impulse. ""He is the son of Blanche Delebarre,"" returned Nina, timidly.. Nina fell upon her knees before her father, and with tears and earnest entreaties pleaded for the mother of Pierre. But the old man was wild and mad with anger. He uttered passionate maledictions on the head of Blanche and her presumptuous son. He positively forbade Nina again leaving the castle on any pretext whatever, under the penalty of never being permitted to return. This was robbing life of every charm,"" says the author.. The Baron Holbein loved his daughter; she was the bright spot in life. To make her happy, he would sacrifice almost anything. For more than a year she had loved the young man with an affection to which every day added tenderness and fervor. Could this be blotted out in an instant by a word of command? No! That love must burn on the same fire as all others.. Nina Holbein was married to Pierre, a young peasant. The Baron of Holbeins was furious at the union. He demanded that the couple leave Florence. The couple agreed to leave when their father would forgive them. The baron tore up the letter and trampled it under his feet. He swore to renounce his child forever. The next twelve months were the saddest of his life. He died of a heart attack.. The Baron Holbein's wife died after more than a year. He would dream of her night after night, and awake in the morning and sigh that the dream was not reality. The image of his child impressed upon his heart, for passion to efface it. The Baron was sent a box containing a portrait of Delebarre by the artist. The portrait was a gift from his son, who was a friend of the Baron. The artist was a young artist, destined to become eminent.. The baron was shown a box containing a picture of his beloved child. He opened it and found a picture showing his daughter Nina with a sleeping cherub in her arms. The old man was overcome with tears, which fell to the floor like rain. He then felt a new and sweeter feeling upon the babe that lay, the impersonation of innocence, in her Arms. The story was told in a book called 'Nina's Story', published in London in 1881.. The Baron Holbein entered Florence. On inquiring for Pierre Delebarre, he found that every one knew the young artist. While in this state of mind, he saw, for the first time, written on the bottom of the picture--""NOT GREAT, BUT HAPPY."" The Baron Hol bein was a great admirer of the work of Pierre Dele barre.. ""That is an humble roof,"" said the man, pointing to where Pierre lived, ""but it contains a noble man."" He turned away, and the baron entered alone. He did not pause to summon any one, but walked in through the open door. All was silent. Was it another picture? No, it was in very truth his child; and her babe. The Young Baron Holbein has an immense picture gallery, and is a munificient patron of the arts. There is one composition on his walls he prizes above all the rest. The wealth of India could not purchase it. It is the same that took the prize when he was but a babe and lay in his mother's arms. The mother who held him so tenderly, and the father who gazed so lovingly upon her pure young brow have passed away, but they live before him daily. He feels their gentle presence ever about him for good."

""The cat can't get down, and so the rabbits are safe"". Mattie's mother said she thought the artist meant to teach a lesson. Mattie asked why there wasn't a dog in the picture. ""I wish he had,"" said the mother. ""As there are evil and hurtful things in the world, we should never be so entirely off of our guard as the children playing, with the rabbits seem to be,"" she said. ""O, I remember,"" she added quickly. ""Yes; I think the artist intended to teach an important lesson when he drew this picture."". Mattie drew a long sigh, as she stood before her mother, looking, soberly into her face. ""I wish there wasn't anything bad in the world,"" she said. ""Nothing that could hurt us."" ""Ah, dear child!"" answered the mother, her voice echoing Mattie's sigh, ""from millions and millions of hearts that wish comes up daily"" ""You said that it might be to teach us never to be off of our guard, because there are evil and hurtful things in the World,"" Mattie replied. ""Yes; and that is a lesson which cannot be learned too early. Baby begins to learn it when he touches the fire and is burnt,"" said the mother.. ""It is the careless and the thoughtless that harm reaches,"" said Mattie. ""Bad thoughts and feelings can do us harm,"" said her daughter. ""Hurt is deeper and more deadly than any bodily harm, for it is done to the soul"" ""On guard"" is the watchword of safety for us all, young and old,"" said the mother. ""There is no other way, my child. 'On guard' is thewatchword ofsafety for us."". ""O, mother! Is it as bad as that?"" said Mattie. ""Yes, my dear,"" said his mother. ""When any of these good and innocent feelings are destroyed by anger, hatred, jealousy, envy, revenge and the like, then just so much of heavenly good dies in us"" ""We are told in the Bible to pray as well as watch. All of us, young and old, must do this if we would be in safety,"" said the author. ""For human will and human effort would all be in vain to overcome evil if divine strength did not flow into them"" ""Unless we desire and pray for this divine strength we cannot receive it,"" said Jesus of Nazareth."

""I declare! if I don't feel right down ashamed of it, every time a visitor, who is anybody, calls in to see me."" ""A new one will cost--"". Mr. Cartwright was trying to put the best face on things while his cousin Sally Gray was coming to visit. His wife said, ""I hear that her husband is getting rich. I don't want her to think that we're growing worse off than when we began life"" No further argument was needed. The carpet was replaced for forty dollars.. Mr. Cartwright had been saving to pay off a loan made by a friend. The family had run up their yearly expenses beyond the year's income. A more costly pattern than could be obtained for one dollar a yard tempted the eyes of his wife. She abstracted from her husband's savings the sum of over fifty dollars.. The new carpet, with its flaunting colors, put wholly out of countenance the cane-seat chairs and modest pier table. Mats and rugs to go with the carpet were indispensable, to give the parlor the right effect in the eyes of Sally Gray.. ""I wonder what new hangings would cost?"" Mrs. Cartwright asked. ""Not much, I presume,"" answered her husband. ""Don't you think we'd better have it done?"" ""Yes,"". A friend loaned Mr. Cartwright one hundred dollars. The friend asked for the money back. Mr.Cartwright was disappointed by the request. He would have asked for an advance. But he did not deem that a prudent step, and for two reasons. He was mortified.. Henry Cartwright received an advance from a friend. He was unable to pay it back. He sent a letter back. His friend sent another letter. Cartwright was angry. He had been mistaken. He returned the letter. He never saw it again.. Henry Cartwright's wife was overjoyed with the new carpet. But she noticed that he was less cheerful. He spoke to her in a way that she thought positively ill-natured. Something was wrong with him; but what that something was, she did not for an instant imagine.. ""It will never do in the world to let cousin Sally find us in this trim,"" said the husband. ""Cousin Sally will find a welcome in our hearts,"" replied her husband, in a sober voice, ""and that, I am sure, will be more grateful to her than new carpets. The next day cousin Sally arrived. She had not come to spy out the nakedness of the land,--not for the purpose of making contrasts between her own condition in life and that of Mr. Cartwright,--but from pure love. Both felt more uncomfortable than they. Cousin Sally was disappointed. She did not find the relative, with whom so many years of her life had been spent in sweet intercourse, as she had hoped to find her. The girlish warmth of feelings had given place to a cold worldliness that repelled her.. ""Dear Mary!"" she said to her cousin, on the morning of the day that was, to end her visit. ""It was to see you, not your furniture, that I came. To look into your heart and feel it beating against mine"". Mrs. Cartwright was mortified and rebuked and these states of feeling united with pride, served to give coldness to her exterior. She tried to be cordial in manner towards her cousin; to seem as if she had not felt her words; but this was impossible, for she had felt them too deeply.. Cartwright's wife felt as if she had lost a friend forever. The letter of her husband's friend, in which he had returned the due bill for one hundred dollars, overwhelmed her with consternation. Cartwright's husband had lost the esteem of one of his oldest and best friends.. The neighbor was sorry. It was the most beautiful pattern she had ever seen. She would hunt the city over but what she would find another just like it. ""Where did you buy it?"" asked the neighbor. ""At Martin's"". ""Go to work,"" replied the neighbor, laughing out at the novelty of the affair. ""Before your task is half done, I will be back with the fifty dollars, and a man to carry home the carpet"". When Mr. Cartwright returned home, and stepped inside of the little parlor, where he found his wife awaiting him, he gave an exclamation of surprise. ""Why, Mary! What is the meaning of this? Where is the new carpet?"" she asked.. ""Let the inner life be right, and the outer life will surely be in just harmony,"" says the author. ""In the humble abode of virtue there is more real happiness than in the palace-homes of the unjust, the selfish, and wrong-doers"""
0.6799999999999999,0.7799999999999999,56.23194845589868,"Mrs. Barbara Uhler presented a notable instance of this. We cannot exactly class her with the ""strong-minded"" women of the day. But she had quite a leaning in that direction. She was so unfortunate as to number among her intimate friends two or three ladies who had a fair title to the distinction of being strong-minded. As for Mr. Herman Uhler, he was looked upon, abroad, as a mild, reasonable, good sort of a man. At home, however, he had a very different estimation. He was held in a verydifferent estimation. His wife was also a woman; and her consciousness of this last named fact was never indistinct.. Barbara Uhler married Herman Uhler in 1847. She was a young woman who had a strong liking for her husband. She refused to obey her husband at the altar. She felt that he was an exacting domestic tyrant. The marriage was annulled in 1849. The couple had a son, who died in 1852. The family moved to New York. The Uhlers later moved to California. They later moved back to New Jersey. They have a daughter, who was born in 1851. The children were not married. The wife was a woman of the church. She had a very strong liking. She did not want to obey him. She wanted to honor him.. Barbara Uhler was told by her husband that he expected too much from her. He also told her that he considered himself to have a right to complain if things were not orderly and comfortable. She responded by saying, ""I'm sorry, dear; but I can't help it"" He asked her if she was sure, and she said, ""Yes, Mr. Uhler"" It was the first time in her life she had ever looked at him with so steady and defiant an aspect. The story of Barbara Uhler is told in the novel ""The House of the Rising Sun"". ""And I am not sure, Mrs. Uhler,"" was his prompt, impulsive reply, drawing himself up, and looking somewhat sternly at his better half. ""You are not?"" said Mrs.Uhler; and she compressed her lips tightly. ""I am not,"" was the emphatic response. ""And what do you expect me to do, pray?"" came next from the lady's lips. ""Have competent assistance, or see that things are done right yourself,"" said the gentleman. ""Do as I do in my business,"" answered the lady. ""Never trust wholly to any individual in my employment"". Herman Uhler's wife suggested he take her out for dinner. He refused, saying she was mistress of the house and should act at her own pleasure. Mrs. Uhler was outraged, and he gave up trying to win her back. He feared the consequences of his transgression would be disastrous. He died in despair, believing he had committed an unpardonable sin. The story of Herman Uhler is told in the novel, ""A Man Walks On To a precipice,"" by Hermann Hesse, published in 1881. The novel is about a man who takes his wife out for a dinner.. Mrs. Uhler knew that her husband expected of her a degree of personal attention to household matters that she considered degrading to her condition as a wife. She gave even less attention to these matters than would otherwise have been the case. For the most part he bore up under them with commendable patience. But, there were times when weak human nature faltered by the way--when, from heart-fulness the mouth would speak. This was but to add new fuel to the flame. This only gave to Mrs Uhler more cause for dissatisfaction. I may find it convenient to act thereon. ""The last part of this sentence was extorted by the continued irritating language of Mrs. Uhlers. Some of the female associates, among whom Mrs. Uhler unfortunately found herself thrown, were loud talkers about woman's rights and man's tyranny. She did not hesitate to allude to her husband as one of the class of men who would trample upon a woman if permitted to do so. By these ladies she was urged to maintain her rights, to keep ever in view the dignity and elevation of her sex, and to let man, the tyrant, know, that a time was fast approaching when his haughty pride would be humbled to the dust. And so Mrs.Uhler trampled upon his rights in numberless ways.. A woman does not reason to just conclusions, either from facts or abstract principles like man. If, therefore her womanly instincts are all right, her conclusions will be true. But if they are wrong, false judgment is inevitable. The instincts of Mrs. Uhler were wrong in the beginning, and she was, in consequence, easily led by her associates, into wrong estimates of both her own and her husband's position. Mr.Uhler made no remark on receiving this information. A meagre, badly-cooked dinner was served, to which he seated himself, alone, not to eat, but to chew the cud of. The usual tea hour was at hand, but, strange to say, the punctual Mr. Uhler did not make his appearance. For an hour the table stood on the floor, awaiting his return, but he came not. Then Mrs.Uhler returned. She stooped not to any inquiry of this kind. She would have regarded it as a betrayal to that personage of a sense of accountability on her part. Shecompromised not the independence of the individual. She was not inclined to be over careful as to the range of her expenditures. She demanded money, and was promptly met.. Never since her marriage had Mrs. Uhler spent so troubled an evening as that one proved to be. A dozen times she rallied herself against the o'er-shadowing concern about her husband. And with this uncomfortable feeling were some intruding and unwelcome thoughts, that in no way stimulated her self-approval. It was nearly eleven o'clock when Mr. Uhlers came home. He brought in his clothes such rank fumes of tobacco, and his breath was so tainted with brandy, that his wife had no need of inquiry as to where he had spent his evening.. Mrs. Uhler was --frightened--shall we say? We must utter the word, even though it meet the eyes of her ""strong minded"" friends. She felt that she was in a dilemma, to which, unhappily, there was not a single horn. Her husband, however, slept ""like a log"" The next morning, her brow was overcast; but his countenance wore a careless aspect. He chatted with the children at the breakfast table, goodnaturedly, but said little to his wife, who had penetration enough to see that he was hiding his real feelings under an assumed exterior.. ""I've engaged to dine at the Astor with a friend,"" said Mr. Uhler. The question irritated the lady. ""You needn't on my account,"" he said. ""I've got a friend to go with me."" ""Oh, very well!"" said the lady, ""I'll go with you."" ""I'm not going to go to the Astors with you,"" said the man. ""But I'll go to dinner with my friend."" ""You're not going with me?"" ""Yes, I'm going to the Astor with my friend."". The husband lost five hundred dollars day before yesterday through the neglect of one of his clerks, while he was riding out with some friends. The husband's wife asked him to give her a hundred dollars. He said he was sorry, but he could not. The couple later married and had a son, who died in a car accident. The son's wife said that she was very proud of her son. The family later had a daughter, who was also a writer. The daughter's husband said that he was proud of his son, too.. ""How could you go away under such circumstances, and trust all to a clerk?"" asked Mrs. Uhler. ""How could I!"" was the quick response. ""Now I shall have to be running around half the morning to make up the sum I need."" ""I have no idea what to do with the money,"" said the woman. ""It's all in my hands now"" ""I'm going to lose it all,"" replied the woman, ""but I'm not going to give it to you."" ""Yes,"" said Mr. Uhlers, ""I am going to make it all up."". The change in her husband, which Mrs. Uhler at first tried to make herself believe was mere assumption or caprice, proved, unhappily, a permanent state. He neglected his business and his home for social companions; and whenever asked by his wife for supplies of cash, invariably gave as a reason why he could not supply her want. He blamed neglect, carelessness, or incompetency of clerks or workmen, when he was away, enjoying himself. For a long time, Mrs.Uhler's independent spirit struggled against the humiliating necessity that daily twined its coils closer and closer around her. She eventually gave in and married a man who was more than twice her husband's age.. The author's wife saw her husband's wrong conduct as a reflection of her own wrong deeds in the beginning. She could not shut the vision out of her mind, and conviction lifted before her mind daily, daily, its rebuking finger, and she couldn't shut it out. In the end there was a failure; and yet, to the end, Mr. Uhler excused his conduct on the ground that he wasn't going to tie himself down like a galley slave to the oar.. Poverty drove the Uhlers out from their pleasant home, and they shrunk away into obscurity, privation, and want. In the last interview held by Mrs. Uhler with the ""strong minded"" friends, she was urgently advised to abandon her husband. Her husband was not the brutal, sensual tyrant this refined lady, in her intemperate zeal, represented him. None knew the picture to be so false as Mrs.Uhler. All that was good and true in her rose up in indignant rebellion. To her poor, comfortless home and neglected children, Mrs. uhler said, 'I am not a woman. I am a woman of the. ""Has my husband really been an exacting tyrant?"" she propounded to herself almost involuntarily. ""Did he trample upon my rights in the beginning, or did I trample on his? He had a right to expect from me the best service I could render, in making his home comfortable and happy. Did I render that service? did I see in my home duties my highest obligation as a wife? have I been a true wife to him?"" So rapidly came these rebuking interrogations upon the mind of Mrs. Uhler, that it almost seemed as if an accuser stood near, and uttered the questions aloud.. Mrs. Bercow found her three little ones huddled together on the floor, the youngest with one of its arms and the side of its face badly burned in consequence of its clothes having taken fire. The girl in whose charge she had left the children, and who, in the reduced circumstances of the family, was constituted doer of all work, had, from some pique, gone away in her absence. When the clothes of the youngest caught in the blaze of a lighted stick, the two oldest, with singular presence of mind, threw around her a wet towel that hung near.. The oldest of the children said that her husband had gone for the doctor. The child said that he wished they had no mother, and then he'd know how to take care of us himself. The words came with the force of a blow. Mrs. Uhler staggered backwards, and sunk upon a chair, weak, for a brief time, as an infant. Ere yet her strength returned, her husband came in with a doctor. He did not seem to notice her presence; but she soon made that apparent. All the mother's heart was suddenly alive in her.. The fire had burned low; and was nearly extinguished. The girl had not returned; and, from what Mrs. Uhler gathered from the children would not, she presumed, come back to them again. She rather felt relieved by her absence. Soon the fire was rekindled; the kettle simmering; and a comfortable supper was on the table, prepared by her own hands, and well prepared too. Mr.Uhler was a little taken by surprise, when, on being summoned to tea, he took his place at the usually uninviting table, and saw before him a dish. Mr. Uhler looked on, in wonder and hope, but said nothing. Strange enough, she was up by day-dawn on the next morning. A very comfortable breakfast was prepared by her own hands. Mr Uhler's wife was a very good cook. She was a good cook, too, but she had no inclination to be so. She had a good mind, and a good heart. But she was not a good baker. She would not have made a good cup of tea, or a good breakfast, or even a good night's sleep. But, with her ample ability to make his home the pleasantest place for him in the world, she made it so.. Mr. Uhler came home from the store, where he was now employed at a small salary, and still more to his surprise, found a well cooked and well served meal awaiting him. Never, since his marriage, had he eaten food at his own table with so true a relish--never before had every thing in his house seemed so much like home. There came, now, to be a sort of tacit emulation of good offices between the wife and husband, who had, for so many years, lived in a state of partial indifference. Mr.Uhler ventured a word of praise, as he sipped his coffee. Never had he tasted finer in his life, he said. Mrs. Uhlers looked gratified; but offered no response.. ""I do not wish to see you a mere household drudge,"" he said. ""I think there is a brighter day coming for us"" ""Whether the day be brighter or darker, I will be to you a true wife,"" he added. ""God helping me, I'll be a true husband"" ""I will be a father to my children,"" he promised. ""They will be happy and proud of me."" ""I'll be proud of my family,"" he told them. ""We'll be happy to have you back"" ""You'll be able to do what you want with your life,"" he assured them, ""and I'll help you."". Mr. Uhler rose to his old position in business, sometimes caused a feeling of wonder to pervade the mind of his wife. From a clerk of one thousand, he soon came into the receipt of two thousand a year, then rose to be a partner in the business, and in a singularly short period was a man of wealth. Mrs.Uhler was puzzled, sometimes, at this, and so were other people. It was even hinted, that he had never been as poor as was pretended. Be that as it may, as he never afterwards trusted important matters to the discretion of irresponsible clerks, his business operations went on prosperously; and, on the other hand, as Mrs. Uhlers became conscious of her. ""The home of her husband was the pleasantest place in the world for him, and his wife, not a mere upper servant, but a loving and intelligent companion"" ""Mrs. Uhler never"
0.86,0.96,71.26239511823036,"Adelaide Merton was a poet who wrote under the signature of her husband. She was described as having a brilliant intellect by a friend. Her power of expression is almost unbounded. Her sentences are perfect pictures of the scenes she describes. If she speaks of a landscape, not one of its most minute features is lost, nor one of the accessories to its perfection as a whole overlooked. She is the author of the book ""The Art of Poetry"" by Adelaide Merton, published in London in 1881. The book is now being published in Paris by the French publisher Paysage de la Garenne. The price for the book is £20,000, or £10,000 for a copy of the original.. ""I was lost in admiration of her qualities. She will yet shine in the world"" - Adelaide Merton. Merton was a young woman who wrote a book about the life of a woman in London. The book was published in 1881 and was a great success. It was the first of a series of books about women's lives in London and the world. The second book, published in 1886, was called ""The Life of a Woman in London"" and was written by Merton's friend, Charles Fenwick. The third and final book, ""The Marriage of Adelaide and Charles,"" was written in 1887 and published by the London School of Economics. It is the first book in a series about women in London, and is published by The London School Of Economics and other publishers. The fourth and final part of the series is called ""Adelaide and Charles"" and is written. Fenwick's father was a merchant, engaged in a calling which was of course despised by the son. The first intention of the elder Mr. Fenwick had been to qualify his son, thoroughly, for the calling of a merchant. But about the age of seventeen, while yet at college, young Fenwick made the unfortunate discovery that he could produce a species of composition which he called poetry. His efforts were praised--and this induced him to go on; until he learned the art of tolerably smooth versification. This would all have been well enough had he not imagined himself to be, in consequence, of vastly increased importance. His mind took in higher aims than these!. The author's father wanted him to be a merchant. He chose a profession that would give him distinction, but not enable him to fill his right place in society. The author was known as a young physician without a patient. He had graduated, but had not yet seen any occasion for taking an office, as his father's purse supplied all his wants. His pursuits were mainly literary--consisting of essays and reviews for some of the periodicals intermixed with a liberal seasoning of pretty fair rhymes which rose occasionally to the dignity of poetry--or, as he supposed, to the lofty strains of a Milton or a Dante. He died in a hotel room in London, where he had been living with his wife and two children. He is survived by his wife, two children, and his wife's parents.. Charles Fenwick met Adelaide Merton in Adelaide, Australia. She was showy in her style of conversation, but exceedingly superficial. Her reading consisted principally of poetry and the popular light literature of the day. At the third visit he was half in love with her, and she more than half inLove with him. A fourth interview completed the work on both sides. The pair were married in London in 1841. Fenwick died in 1852, and Merton died in 1896. The couple had a son, Charles, in 1851. The family moved to London in 1861. The two were married for a year and a half. The marriage was dissolved in 1872. The author died in 1895. The book was published in 1881 by the publishers, Chatto & Windus, with a foreword written by Fenwick.. The young man said in a low, musical tone, full of richness and pathos--""Do you not feel, sometimes, when your mind rises into the region of pure thoughts, and ranges free among the beautiful and glorious images that then come and go like angel visitants, a sense of loneliness, because another cannot share what brings to you such exquisite delight?"" ""Yes--often and often,"" replied the maiden lifting her eyes to those of Fenwick, and gazing at him with a tender expression. ""And yet few there are, Adelaide, few indeed who could share such elevating pleasures,"" said the young man. ""Few, indeed,"" was the response. ""I have been indebted for such added delights,"" said Fenwick. ""Pardon me, for saying,"" resumed the man, ""that to you I. Adelaide held down her head for a moment or two, the position causing the blood to deepen in her cheeks and forehead. Then looking up with an expression of lofty poetic feeling she said -- ""I have known no one, whose current of thought and feeling has seemed so perfect a reflection of my own"" Fenwick said, in a voice that trembled perceptibly, ""I've an inward consciousness, that sprung into activity when the first low murmur of your voice fell upon my ear, that you were to me a kindred spirit"" The pair kissed. Adelaide said, ""You have seemed fully to appreciate my sentiments, and fully to sympathize with them."" Fenwick replied, ""Rarely, indeed, have I been able to find, especially among your gentler sex, one who could rise with me into the. ""I feel impelled, by a movement which I cannot resist, to declare its existence,"" writes the writer. ""First parden this freedom, Adelaide, and then say if you understand and appreciate what I have uttered in all frankness and sincerity?"" ""Not long did our young friend wait for an answer that made him happier than he had ever been in his life,"" writes author. ""Since that moment, this consciousness has grown daily more and more distinct, and now I feel im compelled,by a movement, to declaring its existence"" ""A few months sufficed to comsummate their union, when, in accordance with the gay young couple's desire, old Mr. Mr. Smith married them,"" writes writer. 'They pledge themselves without either having thought of the other's moral qualities,' writes author, ""or either of them having formed any distinct ideas in regard to the true nature of the marriage relation'. Charles Fenwick was a physician by trade. He had no objection to the title, for that sounded quite musical to his ear. But the idea of becoming a practical doctor, was one that Charles could not abide. He would sometimes say to his young wife. ""Why cannot you study law, even now, Charles?"" she asked of him one day. ""Nor can I,"" would be the wife's reply. ""And what is more, I never will consent to such a perversion of your talents."" ""Why didn't I choose the law as a profession?"" he would say. ""Then I might have shone."" ""To bury myself as a physician, stealing about from house to house, and moping over sick beds, is a sacrifice of my talents that I cannot think of without turning from the picture with disgust"". Charles Fenwick's wife suggested that he should take up legal studies. She thought that he would be able to pass an examination in a year or eighteen months. He agreed, and began a course of legal studies, which he completed in about two years. He was then able to take up a position as a barrister in London, and his wife became his wife. The couple had a happy marriage and enjoyed a comfortable life. But they soon found that their lives were no longer suited to them. They began to look down upon the ordinary pursuits of life as far beneath them. The Fenwick family moved to a new home, and Charles became a lawyer. He also married Adelaide, and they had a son, who became a doctor, too. The family had a very happy life, and their son became a judge in London. They also had a daughter, who was a nurse, and a son-in-law.. Charles was admitted to the bar. His father asked him to be interviewed for a job as a lawyer. He was unable to bear the burden of his family's support. He told his son to enter the world for himself, and struggle as all do around you. He said: ""I have spared no expense in your education, bearing you, after your term of college life had expired, through two professional courses"" He was a physician and a lawyer at the time of his father's death. He wrote: ""As far as I am concerned, the tide of prosperity has evidently turned against me"" He went on to write: ""You must, therefore, Charles, enter the World for yourself, and there struggle as I have done, and as alldo around you, for a living"" He died in a car crash in the street, and was buried in his native town.. ""I will spare you out of my income, which will now be small in comparison to what it has been, four hundred dollars a year, for the next two years. You must yourself make up the deficiency, and no doubt you can easily do so."" ""But, father,"" replied the young man, his face turning pale, ""I cannot, possibly, make up that deficiency"" ""Remember that you have no standing in society which you can truly call your own,"" said the old man. ""You must get a house at one half that rent, and reduce your style of living, proportionably, in other respects"" ""What! And compromise my standing insociety? I can never do that, father."". ""You certainly cannot be in earnest, father,"" the son replied, after a few moments of hurried and painful thought. ""How can I possibly get along on that sum?"" ""I do not expect you to live on that, Charles. But the difference you will have to make up yourself,"" replied Mr. Fenwick. ""As for me, as I have already told you, the tide of success is against me, and I am gradually moving down the stream"" ""I am satisfied, that the sooner you are permitted to do so the better,"" said the father. ""I have, heretofore, held you up, and now that my sustaining hand is about to be withdrawn, you must fall or rise to your own level,"" he added. ""You have talents and acquirements. Bring them into useful activity, and you will need little of my assistance"". The Fenwick family were forced to give up their elegantly arranged dwelling. The elder Mr. and Mrs. Fenwick had to choose them a house, and attend to all the arrangements of moving and refitting the new home. ""Four hundred dollars is the extent of what I can give you, and how long the ability to do that may last, Heaven only knows,"" said the elder Fenwick to the young couple. The Fenwick's new home was about one half of its dimensions.. Charles Fenwick's wife, Adelaide, had no idea how to move household furniture. Her husband was away, in some professional friend's office, holding a learned discussion upon the relative merits of Byron and Shelley. Adelaide was buried in the last new novel, while her babe lay in the arms of a nurse, who was thus prevented from rendering any assistance to those engaged in preparing the furniture for removal. After the removal had been accomplished, and the neat little dwelling put, as the elder Mrs. Fenwick termed it, into ""apple-pie order"" the following conversation took place between her and her daughter-in-law. ""Adelaide, it will now be necessary for you to let both your nurse and chambermaid go,"" she said. ""I will take care of that for you,"" said her daughter.. Adelaide Fenwick asked to be allowed to keep her nurse and chambermaid. Mrs. Fenwick replied that she could not afford to keep three servants. ""I couldn't even dress the baby,"" said Adelaide, bursting into tears. ""The sooner you learn, child, the better,"" was the persevering reply of Mrs Fenwick. ""You can readily have the assistance of your cook for a portion of the morning in your chamber and parlors."" ""I was always my own nurse, and never had assistance beyond that of a little girl,"" said the girl. ""It's no use to speak in that way, mother; I cannot do without a nurse"" ""I should think that you would desire no higher pleasure than having all the care of dear little Anna. Fenwick's first job was to find a place for his mother-in-law to work. He was unable to do so, and had to find other employment. He also had to deal with a few petty cases, all of which he rejected. He eventually found a job as a journalist, but had to give up his job to do it. He wrote a book about his experiences, which was published in 1872. He died in 1883, leaving behind a wife and two children. He is survived by his wife and three children.. Charles was in debt to the baker, butcher, milkman, tailor, dry-goods merchants, and to the three servants still retained by his wife. His father's business was brought to a termination by bankruptcy, and the old man, in the decline of life, with still a large family dependent upon him for support, was thrown upon the world. Fortunately, the Presidency of an Insurance Company was tendered him, with a salary of fifteen hundred dollars per annum. On this he could barely support those dependent on him, leaving Charles the whole task of maintaining himself, his wife, and their child. But creditor tradesmen had no nice scruples in regard to these matters, and duns came, consequently, thick and fast, until poor Charles was irritated beyond measure.. Charles Bulwer and his wife were separated for a single year. Charles had no smiling words for his wife. She readily found relief from present reality in the world of pure romance. The more powerful fictions of the day, especially the highly wrought idealities of Bulwer, and those of his class, introduced her into a world above that in which she dwelt. She lingered the greatest portion of her time, unconscious of the calls of duty, or the claims of affection. The due bill of the father, saved the son this utter prostration and disgrace. The effect of all this, was to drive far away from their dwelling the sweet angel of peace and contentment. They were married for one year. The marriage was not consummated until after Charles Bulwer's death in 1841.. Charles Fenwick was a lawyer in London. His father and mother died suddenly. He was forced to rely on his father for support. He made little progress as a lawyer. He rented a handsome house, and furnishing it on credit. He lived in it for four years. He had a son, a daughter, a nurse and a son-in-law. He also had a wife and a child. He wrote a book about his experiences. He died in London in 1881. He is survived by his wife, Adelaide, and his son, Charles, and a daughter- in-law, Charlotte. He has a son and daughter-in law, who live in New York. They live in a house in the centre of London. They have a daughter and son. They also have a child, Adelaide.. The proceeds of the year's practice rose but little above four hundred dollars, and at its conclusion they found themselves involved in. The couple broke up, with all of its harrowing consequences. They then retreated into a couple of rooms, in an obscure part of the town. The wife was reading a novel, when the husband asked to talk to her. She said she had just got into the middle of a most interesting scene. The couple then went to a vacant school, some twenty miles from the city. The husband said: ""There is a school vacant at N----, some 20 miles fromthe city"" The couple left the school, and went to an obscure town. They lived in a small house, with a meagre remnant of their furniture, in the town of N----. They later moved to a larger house, and lived there.. ""And support my family comfortably and honestly,"" Fenwick replied in a tone of bitterness. The salary is eight hundred dollars a year, with a house and garden included. ""I can get the situation, if I will accept of it,"" he said. ""What in the name of wonder has put that into your head?"" Mrs. Fenwick asked. ""That is a matter for you to think about,"" and so saying, ""I'm sure I cannot tell"" ""I cannot succeed at the bar--at least, not for years,"" he replied. ""But surely you can get into something better than the office of schoolmaster, to the sons of clodpoles."". Mr. Fenwick re-opened her book, and commenced poring again over the pages of the delightful work she held in her hand. In a few minutes after he arose, and left the apartment without his wife seeming to notice the movement. A well known individual, coming into the lawyer's office a few moments after he had himself entered, said: ""That trial comes on this afternoon at four o'clock."" ""You had better come then with security, Mr Fenwick,"" said the lawyer. ""The plaintiff is a good deal irritated about the matter, and will push the thing to extremities."" ""Take nothing from nothing, and nothing remains,"" replied the lawyer, ""and nothing remains."". The debt for which the warrant had been issued against Mr. Fenwick, amounted to ninety dollars. The whole of the remaining part of that day was spent in the effort to obtain security in the case. But in vain. His friends knew too well his inability to protect them from certain loss, should they step between him and the law. Talents, education, brilliant addresses, fine poetry ""and all that,"" turned to no good and useful ends, he found availed him nothing now. He was a man of no means, and his life had been taken from him. He had no future, and he had no hope of a future. He wanted to die, and to die in peace.. The idea of being sent to jail for debt, was to him a terrible one. Even many of those with whom he had been in intimate literary association, shrunk away from the penniless individual. He said nothing to Adelaide on returning home in the evening, for the high communion of spirit, in which they had promised themselves such deep and exquisite delight, had long since given place to coldness, and a state of non-sympathy. He found her deeply buried, as usual, in some volume of romance, while every thing around her was in disorder.. Adelaide and Fenwick were living alone in two small rooms. The duty of keeping them in order and providing their frugal meals devolved as a heavy task upon Adelaide. The fire had not even been made, when Fenwick reached home, and the dinner table remained still on the floor, with its unwashed dishes strewn over it, in admirable confusion. With a sigh, Adelaide resigned her book, soon after her husband came in, and commenced preparations for the evening meal. This was soon ready, and despatched. Fenwick put Anna to bed, much against her will, and then drew up to the table again with her book. Adelaide had breakfast on the table. She, without even dressing Anna or arranging her own person sat down to her novel, while he gave himself to the most gloomy and desponding reflections. He felt his hand involuntarily upon his pocket. It was empty. Sometimes his mind would rise into a state of vigorous activity, with the internal consciousness of a power to do any thing. But, alas--it was strength without skill--intellectual power without the knowledge to direct it aright. He was wrung with the bitterest recollections and the most heart-sickening anticipations. He had been blessed with but little sleep.. The writer was sent to prison by a constable. The walls of a jail had something too nearly like reality about them, to leave much of the false sentiment which had hitherto marred his prospects in life. He feared to go out lest the first man he should meet, should prove an officer with an execution upon his person. He asked himself, towards the close of the day, with a strong resolution to discover the best course of action, and to pursue that course, unswayed by any extraneous influences. The writer's decision was made with clearness, vigor, and decision. He was released after a few days. The author was released from prison after a short time.. Fenwick was mistaken in thinking his wife was heartless. She needed a powerful shock to awaken her to true consciousness. That shock proved to be the knowledge of her husband's imprisonment for debt. She repaired, instantly, to the prison, her heart melted down into true feeling. The interview between herself and husband was full of tenderness, bringing out from each heart the mutual affections which had been sleeping there. But one right course presented itself to the mind of either of them, and that was naturally approved by both, as the only proper one. It was the only right course, and it was the one that was accepted by both of them. The only proper course was that which was approved by them both, and which was the right one.. Charles Fenwick was released from prison under the act of insolvency. He asked his wife Adelaide what to do with his time. She suggested the school he had spoken of. He agreed to take it. The school was accordingly taken, and with humbled feelings, modest expectations, and a mutual resolution to be satisfied with little, did Charles Fenwick and his wife re-commence the world at the bottom of the ladder. The story of the Fenwick family is told in the novel, ""The Secret History of Charles and Adelaide Fenwick,"" by Charles Dickens, published in 1881. The novel is published by Hodder & Stoughton, with a copyright by Penguin Books, Inc. (USA) and Hodder and Stoughter, Inc., (UK). The author's wife, too, learned to act well her part in all her relations, social and domestic. She now finds far more pleasure in the realities, than she ever did in the romance of life. The author was sincere in his new formed resolutions, is evident from the fact, that in a few years"
0.42,0.52,36.51191969887076,"Madeline Henry was the wife of Edward Leslie. She was born into a happy home. Her father was a cheerful, unselfish man. He began his business life at the age of twenty-two, as partner in a well established mercantile house. He was able to place ten thousand dollars in the concern, and his position, in the matter of profits, was good from the beginning.. Leslie was a man of integrity, shrewd in his dealings, but never stooped to a system of overreaching. He resolved not to marry until he felt able to maintain a certain style of living. He wronged himself in this; yet, in his worldliness and ignorance, did he feel proud of being above, what he called, the weaknesses of other men.. In social circles, where he occasionally appeared, almost as a matter of course he became an object of interest. There was a coldness in his sphere that chilled her; a rigid propriety of speech and action that inspired too much respect and deference. He was generally regarded as a model of a man. When he, at length, approached Madeline Henry as a lover, the friends of the. Madeline Leslie was the wife of Edward Leslie. She was just 20 years old when she died. For him, a cold, calculating woman of the world were a better companion than Madeline. She yielded up to him a most precious treasure--the love of her young and trusting heart. He was in love with her, and she with him.. Madeline was scarcely the bride of a week, ere shadows began to fall upon her heart. As a daughter, love had ever gone forth in lavish expression. But, from the beginning of her wedded life, she felt the manner of her husband like the weight of a hand on her bosom, repressing her heart's outgushing impulses. One who has her own selfish ends to gain;. Edward Leslie's wife, Madeline, was delighted to see him. She threw her arms about his neck, but soon withdrew. A shadow had fallen on her young heart, and she tried to be cheerful. She asked him what was wrong, and he replied, ""I have been greatly vexed to-day"" He then said, ""Oh, nothing in reality more than usual"". ""I couldn't have believed it of him,"" says the writer. ""He was so absorbed in his own thoughts that he forgot his wife"" The writer's wife was so upset that she cried herself to sleep. ""I was in a state of shock,"" she says, ""and I couldn't believe it."" ""He's a good man,"" she adds, ""but he's a selfish man,"" the writer says. ""It's a pity he didn't see that I was in such a state"". Madeline's husband spoke to her kindly, yet, as she felt, indifferently, while her heart was pining for words of warm affection. For hours after her husband's senses were locked in slumber, she lay wakeful and weeping. He understood not, if he remarked the fact, why her cheeks had less color and her eyes less brightness on the morning that succeeded to this, on Madeline's part, never forgotten evening.. He loved Madeline--as much as he was capable of loving anything out of himself. And he had given her the highest possible evidence of this love, by making her his wife. What more could she ask? It never occurred to his unsentimental thought, that words and acts of endearment were absolutely essential to her happiness. Without his companionship in this world, her heart would feel an aching void.. Madeline Leslie was a loving wife and mother. She died of a heart-sickness. Her spirit first droop. There must be a passing through the fire, with painful purification. Alas! How many perish in the ordeal. How many gentle, loving ones, unequally mated, die, daily, around us. Yet, in truth, failing by the heart-Sickness that has dried up the fountains of life.. Madeline Leslie was dying of ill-health. Her husband, Mr. Leslie, was convinced that she should die. He diverted his thoughts from business and worldly schemes to the means of prolonging her life. He thought her unreasonable, captious, dissatisfied states of mind, having no ground but in her imagination, were heavy heart-strokes. The wretchedness of those weary years.. Madeline Leslie was suffering from mental illness. She spent days in her chamber, refusing to see any one except members of her own family. Her husband told her that she would die, and that her children would feel the loss. She replied that the loss would scarcely be felt by them. She died in her sleep, and her husband died the next day.. Madeline answered not farther, but her husband's words were not forgotten--""My children will feel my loss"" This thought became so present to her mind, that none other could, for a space, come into manifest perception. The child went sobbing from the room. The mother's heart began quickening into life a sense of the mother's duty. She felt, in an instant, that the manner, as well as the fact of the father's denial,. Mrs. Leslie felt, for a time, the ever-present, considerate, loving kindness of one who had made all sunshine in that early home. She said to herself, not passively, like one borne on the current of a down-rushing stream, but resolutely, as one with a purpose to struggle--to suffer, and yet be strong. Her thought, turned from herself, and fixed, with a yearning love upon her children, gave to the blood a quicker motion through. ""Madeline, dear!"" said the mother, in a loving, sympathetic voice. The child flung herself into her arms, and laid her face, sobbing, upon her bosom. ""From that hour, Mrs. Leslie was changed. She could not leave her children, nor could she take them with her if she passed away"". The mother had risen superior to the unhappy, unappreciated wife. The delight of her life had failed; and now, she lived only for the children whom God had given her. Yet the long drooping form of Mrs. Leslie regained something of its erectness, and her exhausted system a degree of tension--the shadow passed not from her heart or brow. The shadow passed from her body, too, but her cheeks grew warm again with the glow of health.. The author's mind chafed at what seemed to him Madeline's unreasonable and unwomanly conduct. He often indulged in the habit of mentally writing bitter things against her. The husband had many things to draw him forth into the busy world, while the wife, seldom seen abroad, gave her very life for her children. The oil was too nearly exhausted when that new supply. Edward Leslie was haunted by thoughts of his mother's death. He felt guilty that he had committed the crime of which he had been guilty. He still heard the eager, ""Kiss me, Edward, once, before I die!"" He was suddenly stung by sharp and self-reproaching thoughts. He had killed his mother, by the slowest and most agonizing process by which murder can be committed."

Miller bought two whole cases this morning. In the original packages, we sell them at a half cent per yard lower than by the piece. ""If they are gone, I can buy something else"" said the cautious purchaser. ""Do you think so?"" asked Johnson. ""I know so,"" replied the cautious buyer. ""Then you won't let me sell you a case?"" ""No, sir."". Watson smiled in a quiet, self-satisfied way as he replied. ""The number of wholesale dealers might be diminished, but failures among them would be of less frequent occurrence"" ""I don't expect to get rich in a day,"" said Watson. ""You'll hardly be disappointed in your expectation,"" remarked Johnson, a little sarcastically. ""Slow and sure don't make much headway in these times,"" said the dealer. ""A man has to be swift-footed to keep up with the general movement."" ""We jobbers would starve if there were no more active men in the trade than you are,"" replied Watson.. ""You discount five per cent. for cash, don't you?"" replied Watson, smiling. ""It is rather slow work at first; but it is safest, and sure to come out right in the end."" ""You're behind the times, Watson,"" said Johnson, shaking his head. ""Do you wish to cash the bill?"" ""Yes; I wish to do a cash business as far as I can,"" said Watson. ""Who can do the most profitable business, a man with a capital of. ""All very good theory,"" said Watson. ""It looks beautiful on paper. Thousands have figured themselves out rich in this way, but, alas! discovered themselves poor in the end"" ""Your large credit men are forever on the street, money hunting, instead of in their stores looking after their business,"" he said. ""Instead of getting discounts that add to their profits, they are constantly suffering discounts of the other kind"" ""Too often, too often, these, and the accumulating stock of unsaleable goods--the consequence of credit temptations in purchasing--reduce the fifteen per cent. you speak of down to ten, and even five per cent,"" he added.. ""Better sell twenty thousand dollars' worth of goods at twenty per cent profit, than eighty thousand at five per cent. You can do it with less labor, less anxiety, and at less cost for rent and clerk hire"" ""Little boats keep near the shore. But, let me tell you, my young friend, your mind is rather too limited for a merchant of this day"" ""There is Mortimer, who began business about the time you did. How much do you think he has made by a good credit?"" ""I'm sure I don't know."". Watson met the daughter of Mr. Johnson in a company where he chanced to be. She was an accomplished and interesting young woman, and pleased Watson particularly. Watson was equally well pleased with her, and she with him. The father of the daughter, who was present, saw, with a slight feeling of disapprobation, the lively conversation that passed between the young man and his daughter. The daughter did not appear to notice his remark. One evening, not long after this, as the family of Mr Mr Johnson were leaving, the father made it a point to refer to him in a way to give the impression that he held him in light estimation.. Flora and Mr. Johnson were about leaving the tea-table, where they had remained later than usual. A domestic announced that there was a gentleman in the parlor. Flora asked, ""Who is it?"" and was answered, ""Mr. Mortimer"" ""Perhaps you don't know him,"" said her father, impatiently. ""This would not be right. Are you engaged?"" ""Yes,"" said Flora.. ""I will see Mr. Mortimer that I will see him in a little while,"" she then said, and, as the domestic retired to give the answer, she ascended to her chamber to make some slight additions to her toilet. To meet the young man by constraint, as it were, was only to increase in Flora's mind the dislike she had expressed. So coldly and formally was Mortimer received, that he found his visit rather unpleasant than agreeable, and retired, after sitting an hour, somewhat puzzled as to the real estimation in which he was held by the lady. Mr. Johnson was very much inclined to estimate others by a money-standard of valuation.. Mortimer was frequently referred to in the presence of Flora, and praised in the highest terms. The more her father said in favor of the thrifty young merchant, the stronger was the repugnance felt towards him by Flora. This went on until there came a formal application from Mortimer for the hand ofFlora. It was made to Mr. Johnson first, who replied to the young man that if he could win the maiden's favor, he had his full approval. His offered hand was firmly declined by the maiden, who said: ""Am I to consider your present decision as final?""""I wish you to do so, Mr Johnson,"" replied Mortimer, ""I wish to win your favor"". ""Your father approves my suit,"" said he. ""I have his full consent to make you this offer of my hand."" ""I cannot but feel flattered at your preference,"" returned Flora. ""But, to accept your offer, would not be just either to you or myself"" ""I, therefore, wish you to understand me as being entirely in earnest,"" said Mr. Mortimer. ""You are not in earnest at all,"" said Flora, ""but I am in earnest."" ""You have my full consent,"" said Mortimer, ""to make you my hand"" ""And I will not turn it down,"" saidFlora.. Mr. Johnson was sitting in a moody and angry state of mind about an hour after supper, when a domestic came into the room and said that Mr. Watson was in the parlor. Mr. Johnson descended to theparlor and met the young man. He asked for Miss Flora, who was in her room, and let her stay there. He then turned on the visitor.. ""I have called to see your daughter Flora,"" returned the young man, calmly. ""Then, I wish you to understand that your call is not agreeable,"" said the father of the young lady. Watson bowed respectfully, and, without a word more, retired from the house. The calm dignity with which he had received the rough treatment of Mr. Johnson, rebuked the latter, and added a feeling of shame to his other causes of mental disquietude. On the next day Flora received a letter from Watson, in part in these words-- ""I called,. Watson wrote to Flora to express his sincere regard for her. He also asked her to overcome her father's prejudices. Flora replied early, avowing her own attachment, but urging him to do all in his power to overcome the prejudice. Watson replied: ""I deeply regret your father's state of feeling. His full approval of my suit, next to yours, I feel to be in every way desirable"" The pair were married in April, 1831. The wedding was held at the Grand Hotel in New York City, and was attended by many guests, including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. For more information on the wedding, visit: http://www.newspaper.co.uk/news/features/1831/watson-and-flora. Mr. Johnson, who saw, too plainly, that opposition on his part would be of no avail, yielded a kind of forced consent that the plodding, behind-the-age young merchant, should lead Flora to the altar. That his daughter should be content with such a man, was to him a source of deep mortification. He saw Flora given to another without a feeling of regret. He, too, was present. His disappointment in not obtaining the hand of Flora, had been solaced in the favor of one whose social standing and money-value was regarded as considerably above that of the maiden who had declined the offer of his hand.. Mr. Johnson married the daughter of a gentleman who considered himself fortunate in obtaining a son-in-law that promised to be one of the richest men in the city. Mortimer built himself a splendid dwelling almost beside the modest residence of Mr. Johnson's wife. Invitations to this were not extended to either Mr.Johnson's family or to that of his son- in-law. Mr Johnson bore his disappointment with a very poor grace, so poor, that he scarcely treated the husband of his daughter with becoming respect. He was particularly galling to the former. A few weeks subsequent to this, he stood beside Mr. Watson in an auction room. When asked by the auctioneer. ""You can sell them at an advance,"" urged Mr. Johnson. ""No,"" replied the young man, with his usual calm tone and quiet smile. ""Slow and sure--that is my motto. I only buy the quantity of an article that I am pretty sure will sell"" ""But these wouldn't have lain on your shelves. You could have sold them at a quarter of a cent advance to-morrow, and thus cleared sixty or seventy dollars."" ""That is mere speculation,"" said the auctioneer. ""The chance of making a good operation was before you, and you did not improve it"". ""You will never get along at your snail's pace,"" said Mr. Johnson. Watson turned away, and retired from the auction room. At the end of fifteen years, Mortimer was reputed to be worth two hundred thousand dollars. Every thing he touched turned to money; at least, so it appeared. His whole conversation was touching handsome operations in trade. Not a day passed in which he had not some story of gains to tell. He was a man of many talents, but his greatest talent was his ability to control his temper.. Watson was not anxious to get rich fast; at least, not so anxious as to suffer himself to be tempted from a safe and prudent course. He kept plodding along in the old way, making his regular business purchases, and gradually extending his operations. He never made a display for the sake of establishing a credit, for he never wanted to be seen as a credit-taker. He was always engaged in money raising, and his line of discounts was enormous. His father-in-law began to understand him a little better than at first, and to appreciate him more highly. On more than one occasion, he had been in want of a few thousand dollars in an emergency, when the check of Watson promptly. He always purchased for cash, and thus obtained his goods from five to seven per cent cheaper than his neighbors. Under this system, his profits were, usually, ten per cent. more than the profits of many who were engaged in the same branch of trade. His credit was so good, that the bank where he kept his account readily gave him all the money he asked on his regular paper. He was able to make his own discriminations and to form his own estimates of men--and these were generally correct. He never exchanged notes, nor asked an endorser on his business paper. But it was known to some, that he generally had a comfortable balance.. The story of Mr. Watson is told in the novel, ""A Man Walks into a House"" The story is told about a man who buys a large building lot. The price is ten thousand dollars, but the location is desirable. The man decides to build the house on the lot, but does not buy it as an investment. The story ends on a happy note, with the man's wife and children in the house. The book is called ""The Man Who Walked In A House"" and is published by Simon & Schuster, Inc.. ""I have always intended to build a house so soon as I felt able to do it according to my own fancy,"" said Mr. Johnson. ""I want a dwelling for myself,"" said Watson. ""So it seems,"" was Watson's quiet answer. No more was said, and the two men walked on. ""Perhaps he is going to Europe to make a tour with his family,"" he suggested. ""Or he has got to the end of his rope,"" replied Watson, ""so it is said"". Mr. Johnson was almost startled at the painful change which had taken place. A little while afterwards he looked upon the cheerful, smiling face of his daughter Flora, and there arose in his heart, almost involuntarily, an emotion of thankfulness that she was not the wife of Mortimer. Could he have seen what passed a few hours afterwards, in the dwelling of the latter, he would have been more thankful than ever. He had been away since morning. Since seven o'clock, the tea-table had been standing in the floor, awaiting his return. He was away for several hours. He came home early in the evening. He left the tea on the table.. Mortimer was absent from his home for several hours. His wife found him in bed, and asked him what was the matter. Mortimer did not reply, but stood like a statue of despair. He then groaned aloud, and his wife ran to him for help. The story was told in a book called ""The Death of Henry Mortimer,"" published in London in 1881. The book was written by Mortimer's son, who was also a writer. The novel was published by William Morrow, and was first published in 1883. It was a best-seller.. ""Ruined! Ruined!"" now came hoarsely from the lips of Mortimer. He threw himself on a sofa, and wrung his hands in uncontrollable anguish. At last, however, he made a few vague explanations, to the effect that he would be compelled to stop payment on the next day. ""I thought,"" said Mrs. Mortimer, ""that the sale of this house was to afford you all the money you needed."" ""It is not sold yet,"" was all his reply to this.. Mortimer's wife was asleep in a crib next to his bed. He stood over the unconscious slumberer, and touched its forehead with his lips. He was bending to kiss her, when a movement, as if she were about to awaken, caused him to step back, and stand holding his breath. He gazed at her for some moments, with a sad, pitying look. He then stood up and walked the floor of his chamber. He never looked at his wife again, and she never saw him again. He died in his sleep, and his wife died in her bed, with tears on her cheeks.. Mortimer did not again approach the bed-side, but stepped noiselessly to the chamber door. He passed into the next room, where three children were buried in tranquil sleep. A hurried glance was taken of each beloved face, and a kiss laid lightly upon the lips of each. A moment or two more, and he was beyond the threshold of his dwelling. ""Circumstances make it necessary for me to leave the city by the earliest conveyance,"" the letter read. ""I am sorry to have to leave you, my wife, but it is the only thing that can be done for you,"" it added.. Mrs. Mortimer's first act was to destroy the note. Next she strove to repress the wild throbbings of her heart. She was too weak for the trial; and who can wonder that she was? Mr. Johnson was sitting in his store about half past three o'clock that afternoon. A man came in and asked him for the payment of a note of five thousand dollars. ""What does this mean?"" exclaimed Mr. Johnson. ""I have no paper out for that amount falling due to-day"" ""I will write to you in a little while. May Heaven give you strength to bear the trials through which you are about to pass!"". A note for five thousand dollars was presented to me by the Notary a little while ago. Let me see it?"" he said. ""To whom is it payable?"" he added. ""Mortimer, as I live!"" he replied. ""He has forged my name also."" ""Is it possible? But this is no loss to you?"" he asked. ""If he has resorted to forgery to sustain himself,"" replied Mr Mortimer.. ""I am pained to hear that you are so deeply involved,"" said Mr. Watson. ""But, do not let it trouble you too much. I will defer my building intentions to another time, and let you have whatever money you may need."" Mr. Johnson made no answer. His eyes were upon the floor and his thoughts away back to the time when he had suffered the great disappointment of seeing his daughter marry the slow, plodding Watson. Instead of becoming the wife of the enterprising Mortimer. Watson, the son of a wealthy banker, was the father of the young Johnson.. ""You may depend on me for at least twenty thousand dollars,"" replied Watson, cheerfully; ""and for even more, if it is needed."" It was soon known that Mortimer had committed extensive forgeries upon various persons, and that he had left the city. Officers were immediately despatched for his arrest, and in a few days he was brought back as a criminal. In his ruin, many others were involved. Among these was his father-in-law, who was stripped of every dollar in his old age. ""It is the safest and the best way, and certainly leads to prosperity,"" said Mr. Johnson.. ""Happy for me that his was a"

""I believe I'll try old Mr. Green,"" said his father as he left the house.. Mrs. Green gave her husband a bowl of hot whiskey-punch. ""It is not always good,"" remarked Mrs. Green, ""to have the pores open. We are more liable to take cold"". Knowing Brooks to be a violent man when intoxicated, Mr. Green left his house hurriedly. On entering the house, a sad scene presented itself. The oldest daughter of Brooks, a girl in her seventeenth year, was lying upon a bed.. ""Had the injury been a few inches farther up, she would ere this have breathed her last,"" said the doctor--looking steadily at Brooks, until the eyes of the latter sunk to the floor. In a little while, she began to moan,. Thomas Brooks' wife asked him about the incident. He said that when Brooks is drunk, he acts like a demon. She said, ""Oh, me! to what dreadful consequences does this drinking lead!"". Mr. and Mrs. Green were talking about their friend Brooks. Brooks had lost all control over himself, said Mrs Green. Brooks was a drunkard, but he had not been drinking for years. Mrs Green said that a man's habit of drinking was formed slowly.. ""Touch not, taste not, handle not. This is the only safe rule,"" said Mrs. Green. ""The man who never drinks is in no danger of becoming a drunkard,"" said her husband. ""A more promising young man could not be found--nor one with a kinder heart"". Henry Green was suffering from a cold. He asked his son if he had gotten the Irish whiskey he had sent for. The child replied that he had not, because he had seen Mr. Brooks strike his mother.. Henry looked at the bottle, then at his father, in so strange a way, that Mr. Green, who did not at first comprehend what was in the child's thoughts wondered still more. All was soon understood, for Harry, bursting. Mrs. Green made the herb-tea for her husband, and it proved quite as"

That my powers were exceedingly limited, and my gifts few,"" he adds.. ""You will admit,"" said one -- I thought it strange at the time that there should be even one to speak a word in favor of my poor performance--""that it will do good?"" ""Good!"" was answered, in a tone slightly touched by contempt. ""Oh, yes; it. ""Tame, dull, and commonplace!"" I felt the condemnation more strongly than before.

""In that is the Divine image"" ""I am sick of the commonplace!"" he added. ""The tiller of the soil is going forth again to his work"". ""Do not turn your eyes from him, and let a feeling of impatience stir in your heart because he is not a soldier rushing to battle, or a brilliant orator holding thousands enchained by the power of a fervid eloquence,"" he said.. ""Oh, this is sublime!"" I murmured, as I gazed upon the cloudy hosts moving across the heavens in battle array.. ""Brilliant! Sublime! Grand beyond the power of descriptions"" I said, as the storm deepened in intensity. Next came the rushing and roaring wind, bending the giant-limbed oaks as if they were but wands of willow.. The author was on a mountain top when a storm swept through the valley below. The old man who had been with him said: ""There is a higher power in the gentle rain than lies in the rushing tempest"" He then said that the rain was the power of restoration and recreation.. ""Which is best? Which is most to be loved and admired?"" said the old Man. I continued to gaze upon the force of the prostrate man, until there came into it a flush of life. Then his limbs quivered; he threw his arms about. A groan issued from his. The dreamer saw a house struck by lightning, and men repairing fences, barns, and other objects upon which had been spent the fury of the excited elements. The dreamer asked: ""Which office would you like best to assume--which is the most noble--the office of the destroyer. The watchman was a humble man, forced by necessity into his position, and rarely thought of and little regarded by the many. He passed on; and, as his form left my eye, the thought of him passed from my mind. Not long after, unheralded by the sound of footsteps. ""Help! help! murder!"" shrieked a woman from the open window. With a single stroke of his heavy mace, he laid the midnight robber and assassin senseless upon the floor. How instantly was that humble watchman ennobled in my eyes! How high and important was his use in society!"". ""I am dull, tame, and commonplace beside these children of genius,"" I thought. ""Not so!"" said my companion. ""How poor and mean is the work that comes from my hands!"" ""Commonplace!"" I said. ""Thank God for the commonplace and the useful!"". ""Glorious! Divine! Godlike!"" Such were the admiring words that fell from the lips of all. ""Nothing that is useful is poor and mean. Look up!"". ""Beautiful! beautiful!"" fell, ever and anon, from a woman's lips.

""Of course, you ought to know your own state of mind best,"" said Lizzy. ""I try to make myself agreeable to every one,"" replied the even-minded girl. ""That is a duty I owe to those with whom I associate"" ""You may be able to disguise your real feelings, but I cannot,"" said Miss Hubert.. Margaret Clinton's heart had, almost unsought, been won. The manly bearing, personal grace and brilliant mind of Philip Clinton, had captivated her feelings and awakened an emotion of love. She was then aware of the rashness she had displayed, and her pride instantly took the alarm.. Clinton observed the marked change in her manner. She wished to be sought before she was won. Her lover must come, like a knight of old, and sue on bended knee for favor. Clinton was not so deeply in love as to be very seriously distressed.. Clinton was disgusted by the way Margaret looked at him when he made advances. He believed in frankness, honesty and reciprocal sincerity. The thought of being experimented upon in this way, did not in the least tend to soften his feelings towards the fair. The game which Miss Hubert was playing had been in progress only a short time, when her friend Lizzy Edgar, who was on terms of close intimacy, spent the day with her. The two young ladies attired themselves with much care, each with a view to effect. ""If she be playing a part, as I more than half suspect,"" said the young man to himself, ""her performance will end to-night, so far as I am concerned"". Clinton bowed and turned away. She had carried her experiment too far. As the young man moved across the room, he saw Lizzy Edgar sitting alone. Her face lit up with interest as she noted the various costumes.. Margaret Hubert and her sweet friend Lizzy Edgar. Margaret had a warmer color on her cheeks than usual, and her dignity towered up into an air of haughtiness. Its effect was to make his heart cold towards her, instead of awakening an ardent. Clinton lingered by the side of Miss Edgar, more charmed with her than he had ever been, until some one else came and engaged the hand of Miss Hubert. The disappointed and unhappy girl now unbent herself from the cold dignity that had marked her bearing. Lizzy Edgar was in a long-continued and wild struggle with her feelings. She wrestled vigorously, but in vain, with a passion that, but for her own folly, would have met a free and full return.. Lizzy was deceived by her friend's manner. She saw that Margaret was far from being happy, and often tenderly urged her to tell the cause. But little dreamed of the real nature of her sufferings. Lizzy's heart trembled faintly in her bosom.. Margaret Hubert and Lizzy Edgar were to marry. Lizzy asked Margaret to be by her side when the nuptial pledge was given. Margaret said she would not refuse her friend's request.. Margaret felt so sad at heart that she wept, and, weeping, wished that she could die. She felt that she was about entering upon a trial for which her strength would be little more than adequate. From the time Margaret took her place on the floor, she felt her power over herself failing.. Margaret Hubert was married to a minister in 1852. The couple had been together for a year before the marriage was annulled. Margaret Hubert is still unmarried."

For the whole tribe of American dandies, with their disfiguring moustaches and imperials, she had a most hearty contempt. Hair never made up, with her, for the lack of brains or brains.. Kate grew up as with a brother with Edwin Lee. Their intercourse was of the most frank and confiding character. But there came, at last, a change in their relationship. Edwin Lee became one of Mr. Darlington's most active, trustworthy and intelligent clerks. His kind, modest, gentlemanly deportment at home, won the favor and confidence of all. Edwin could not understand the reason of this change. Kate was the same to him; and yet not the same. When she looked him steadily in the face, his eyes would droop, involuntarily, beneath her gaze. From that moment, he became reserved in his intercourse with her. After a short time, he firmly made up his mind that it was his duty to retire from the family of his benefactor.. Edwin could not leave the home where he had been so kindly regarded for years, without offering some reason that would be satisfactory. He, therefore, sought and obtained the situation of supercargo in a vessel loading for Valparaiso. Kate heard the announcement with no less surprise than her father. The true reason, he could not, of course, give.. Edwin Darlington was to sail with the vessel. He had avoided being alone with Kate, a fact which the observant maiden had not failed to notice. The thing was so sudden, so unlooked for, and, moreover, so uncalled for, that she could not understand it. Edwin acknowledged the kindness, in the warmest terms, but remained firm in his. ""You have a reason, for going, of course. Why, then, not tell it frankly? Are we not all your friends?"" Edwin was silent, and his eyes rested upon the floor. ""And when I think it right to do a thing, I never hesitate or look back."". ""I have found out,"" she said, speaking with great self-composure, ""the reason why Edwin persists in going away."" ""Ah! what is the reason, Kate? I would give much to know."" ""He is in love,"" replied Kate, promptly. Then rising up. ""Love would make him stay,"" replied the maiden with a sparkling eye, and something of proud elevation in the tones of her voice. ""I doubt if the secret has ever passed his lips,"" replied Kate. ""Secrets like this do not always need oral or written language to make them known,"" said Mr. Darlington.. Kate Darlington, the daughter of a poor clerk, tells her father of her love for her brother. Mr. Darlington is taken altogether by surprise at so unexpected an announcement. ""Kate,"" said he, after a moment or two of hurried reflection, ""this is a very serious matter"" ""And I,"" said Kate, rising up, and taking the words from her father,. ""Father, don't let us argue this point. Do you want Edwin to go away?"" Kate asked her father. ""No dear; I certainly don't wish him to go,"" he replied. ""Nor do I,"" returned the maiden, as she leaned forward again, and laid her face upon his arm.. Edwin, we none of us wish you to go away. You know that I have urged every consideration in my power, and now I have consented to unite with Kate in renewing a request for you to remain. Up to this time you have declined giving a satisfactory reason for your sudden resolution to leave; but a reason is due to us--to me in particular. Kate Darlington married Edwin Lee, a clerk. The couple sailed on the ship ""Leonora"" to England. Kate returned to her husband after a few days. Mr. Darlington retired from his post."

Mrs. Andrews looked troubled, and moving uneasily in her chair. The music had struck up, and the dancers were in motion. ""I can't remain here!"" said Mrs Andrews. ""It's an outrage!"" said the dancer who was seated next to her. ""Not dancing, surely!"" she said. ""Cotillions, I presume,"" was answered, carelessly, ""not dancing, Surely!"". The lady by whom she was sitting comprehended now more clearly her state of mind, and laying a hand on her arm, gently restrained her. ""Why not remain? What is an outrage, Mrs. Andrews?"" she asked. ""Mrs. Burdick knew very well that I was a member of the church."" The lady's manner was indignant. ""I could not have believed it of Mrs. Burden,"" she said. ""She doesn't expect you to dance, Mrs Andrews,"" said the lady. ""But she expects me to countenance the sin and folly by my presence."". ""I know wise and good people who hold a different opinion,"" Mrs. Andrews said. ""I wouldn't give much for their wisdom and goodness--not I!"" ""What child can breathe that atmosphere for years, and not grow up with a clouded spirit?"" she asked. ""No child can,"" replied the woman, ""and not growup with a fountain of bitterness in the heart!"" ""Is, in fact, a means of grace?"" asked the woman. ""Yes,"" said the woman with a nod. ""Dancing makes people better."" ""No,"" said Mrs. Andrew. ""It's a sin to dance."". ""Did you ever dance?"" asked the lady. ""No. I say no such thing."" ""Can you say nothing worse of it?"" ""I could, but delicacy keeps me silent."" ""It is an idle waste of time,"" said the woman. ""In itself the act is innocent."". ""All good things become evil in their perversions,"" said the lady. ""The same may be said of church going"" ""Excuse me, but you are profane,"" said Mrs. Andrews. ""I trust not. For true religion--for the holy things of the church--I trust that I have the most profound reverence"" ""Let me prove what I say, that even church going may become evil."" ""I am all attention,"" said an incredulous Mrs Andrews, ""but I am profane."" ""Why everybody admits that,"" said a young man.. ""You can bear plain speaking,"" says the church member. ""I am ready to prove the negative against any allegations you can advance,"" she says. ""There has been a protracted meeting in Mr. B----'s church,"" she adds. ""And a blessed time it was,"" the man replies. ""Yes, every day; and greatly was my soul refreshed and strengthened,"" the woman adds.. ""A tree is known by its fruit,"" said Mrs. Andrews, who felt the rebuke. ""True; and by their fruits shall ye know them,"" replied the lady. ""But come, there are too many around us here for this earnest conversation. We will take a quarter of an hour to ourselves in one of the less crowded rooms"" The two ladies quietly retired from the drawing rooms. As soon as they were more alone, the last speaker resumed. ""Judge not, that ye be not judged, is the divine injunction."" ""By their fruits ye shall know them"" ""By the fruits of the tree, by their fruit, we will know them."". The author was passing in his neighborhood when he met Mrs. Eldridge. She was playing the piano, with her baby asleep on her arm, and four children dancing. The children were a more innocent, loving, happy group I have never seen. Not an unkind word was uttered by one of the children, nor did anything occur to mar the harmony of the scene. It was a sight on which angels could have looked, nay, did look with pleasure; for, whenever hearts are tuned to good affections, angels are present. The author was so interested that he forgot the questionable propriety of his conduct. He then went on to meet two other ladies, who were having a meeting of their own. The story of this meeting is told in the next chapter of his book, ""The Man Who Grew a Tree"". ""I've turned nurse for the afternoon, you see,' said Mrs. Eldridge. 'It's Alice's day to go out, and I never like to trust our little ones with the chambermaid, who is n't over fond of children' The music was suspended, and the dancing ceased, as I presented myself. The mother greeted me with a happy smile, and each of the children spoke to her visitor with an air at once polite and respectful. They've read, and played, and told stories, until tired, and now I've just brightened them up, body and mind, with a dance.' The children all looked. bright and happy they all looked, says the author.. Mrs. Eldridge's little boy refused to say his prayers. She tried in every way that she could think of to induce him to kneel with the other children, and repeat a few simple words. There seemed to be a vein in his character that argued no good. She said: 'If duly fixed, this idea will ever remain, and be the vessel, in after years, for the reception of truth flowing down from the great source of all truth' The story of Eddy's prayer is told in a book called The Little Eddy of God, published in 1881. The book is about the life of a little boy named Eddy, and his prayer to God. The author also tells of the story of the little boy's prayer to his mother, and how he became a man.. ""Tears were in the eyes of Mrs. Eldridge, as she uttered the closing words"" ""I felt that she was a true mother, and loved her children with a high and holy love"" ""The effect was all I had hoped to produce."" ""I am compelled to say, want of charity towards all who happen to differ with her"" ""There is no place in the world for a woman who is not a member of the church"" ""It is the duty of all of us to try to be the best we can be"" ""We are all part of the same family, and we are all in this together"" ""If you want to be a man, you have to be part of a family"". The author rang the doorbell and heard a clatter of feet and boisterous voices. He asked for the mother of the children, but was told she had gone to church. The cook, attracted from the kitchen by the noise, swung the door open and he entered the parlor. The children's mother, Mary, was not at home, and the cook said: 'I wish she'd stay at home' The author then went to see Mary, and found her in a state of panic. She had been taken to hospital, and had been admitted with a broken leg. She was later released, but had to have her leg re-attached.. ""At this moment a headless doll struck against the side of my neck. It had been thrown by one child at another; missing her aim, she gave me the benefit of her evil intention"" ""Such children I never saw! They don't mind a word you say, and quarrel so among themselves, that it makes one sick to hear them."" ""The language used by that child, as she escaped from the cook's hands, was shocking. It made my flesh creep!"" ""I was so ashamed of myself. I was so angry with myself. It was the worst day of my life"". ""As the table fell, it came within an inch of striking another child on the head, who had seated himself on the floor"" ""O dear!' I can hear his voice now, with its tone of hopelessness,--'This church-going mania is dreadful"" ""I tell my wife that it is all wrong. That her best service to God is to bring up her children in the love of what is good and true,--in filial obedience and fraternal affection"" ""The face of Mrs. Andrews became instantly of a deep crimson. She caught her breath, and grew very pale"" ""A fractured skull, perhaps instant death, would have been the consequence"". ""Have I not clearly shown you that even church-going may be perverted into an evil? That piety may attain an inordinate growth, while charity is dead at the root? Spiritual pride; a vain conceit of superior goodness because of the observance of certain forms and ceremonies, is the error into which too many devout religionists fall,"" she said. ""God sees not as man seeth. He looks into the heart, and judges his creatures by the motives that rule them."" ""I am a man of God, and I will not be ashamed of my God,"" she added. ""I will not turn my back on my God, or on my children."". Many a purer heart than that of the humbled Pharisee beat there beneath the bosoms of happy maidens even though their feet were rising and falling in time"

You look pale from confinement. Come; I cannot go without you."" ""I trust not, Henry,"" said his friend, William Moreland. ""Let me in turn urge you to stay."" ""It is in vain, William,"" his friend said, interrupting him. ""I cannot go with you, to-day"". ""Henry, the worst of all kinds of deception is self-deception. Don't, let me, beg of you, attempt to deceive yourself in a matter so important"" ""I don't know; I can't altogether say that it is; indeed, I never thought about it."" ""I am sure you have experienced this reluctance to resuming work after a day of pleasure. It is a universal experience"" ""Surely, my early friend and companion is not deaf to reason?"" ""No, not to right reason."". ""I have observed in you an increasing desire to get away from work. Can you tell me how many days you have been out of the shop in the last three months?"" ""No, I cannot,"" was the reply, made in a tone indicating a slight degree of irritation. ""How many is it, then?"" ""Ten days."". ""Don't make excuses, Henry. Think of the aggregate of ten lost days"" ""I am plain with you, because I am your friend, and you know it"" ""Do not, then, add fuel to a flame, that, if thus nourished, will consume you"" ""Don't you remember the day you were made sick by fatigue?"" ""Yes, true, but that is only six"" ""And the day he went up the mountain with the party"" ""Yes."". Henry Thorne's own inclinations were stronger than his friend's arguments. He wanted to go with two or three companions a gunning, and even the vision of his young wife shrinking in the keen winter wind, was not sufficient to conquer this desire. ""I will go this once, William,"" said he, at long inspiration; ""and then I will quit it. I see and acknowledge the force of what you say; I never viewed the matter so seriously before"" ""This once may confirm a habit now too strongly fixed,"" urged his companion. ""Sixty dollars a year buys a great many comforts for a poor man."". Henry Thorne and William Moreland were workmen in a large manufacturing establishment in one of our thriving inland towns. They had married sisters, and thus a friendship that had long existed, was confirmed by closer ties of interest. Henry's earnings brought many more comforts for his little family than did Henry's. The difference was not to be accounted for in the days the other spent in pleasure taking. The pair had been married about two years, at the time of their introduction to the reader, and, already, Moreland could perceive that his earnings brought much more comfort for his family than Henry's did.. William Moreland's wife, Jane, was a woman of a different class to her husband. She was more likely to spend money than save, and had less of good and comfortable clothing than her sister. The two women were close friends, and shared a love of the country. Moreland told his wife of his plans to take charge of his wife's house. He said that he would give her his full support if she would let him do so. She said she would not, and that he should take care of her house. The pair had a long conversation, and Moreland said he would take care to do this.. Jane and Ellen were talking about the coming winter. Jane said, in allusion to the season: ""It begins to feel a little chilly to-day, as if winter were coming"" Ellen replied, in a serious tone: ""Henry's earnings, somehow or other, don't seem to go far with us"" Jane replied: ""I am sorry for that. But keep a good heart about it, sister. Cold weather is coming, and we haven't a dollar laid by for anything"". ""I cannot bear the thought of your going all this winter again without one,"" said Ellen. ""I saw him yesterday, when he was well."" ""He's off gunning, I suppose, again,"" said Moreland. ""If so, it is the tenth day he has lost in idleness during the last two months"" ""I shall be sorry to do this for your sake, and for the sake of his wife,"" Moreland said. ""But I do not like such an example to the workmen and apprentices."" ""Besides being away from the shop often disappoints a job,"" said the doctor.. ""You are late this morning, Henry,"" said the owner of the shop to him, in the presence of the other workmen. ""It's only a few minutes past the time,"" was replied, moodily. ""Well, if it is, I can make it up,"" he said. ""That is not the right way, Henry. Lost time is never made up."" ""I have talked to him frequently, but he has got so that he won't bear it any longer from me,"" replied the owner.. Henry Thorne was angry with a journeyman who was disrespectful to him. He said: ""You are discharged;"" and instantly turned away. Henry Thorne then went to his cottage and found his wife, Ellen, with a baby in her lap. She had a troubled expression, and her face was paler and more care-worn than it was a year before. She said to him: ""Do you mean to say that I would cheat you, sir?"" He replied: ""No, I don't mean that."". Henry was discharged from his post at the shop. His wife, Ellen, asked him what had happened. He said he had been taken to task by the owner of the shop, and that he had not acted honestly towards him. She asked him how it had happened, and he said he did not know himself. He then told her he had gone to see a man at the upper end of the town, and had returned an hour later than usual. He was discharged, and there was no other place in the town to see him. Ellen asked him, ""O, Henry! how did that happen?"". ""But something will turn up for us, Henry, I know it will,"" said Ellen, trying to smile encouragingly. ""I answered him in anger, and was discharged on the spot. And now, what we are to do, heaven only knows! Winter is almost upon us, and we have not five dollars in the world."" ""I cannot bear from any one; I answered him ... and I was discharged,"" she said. ""And now, I cannot bear to see my child in pain,"" she added, ""and I am ashamed of myself."". Jane came in with her usual cheerful, almost happy face, bringing in her hand a stout bundle. Her countenance changed in its expression to one of concern, the moment her eyes rested upon her sister's face. Ellen could not reply; her heart was too full. Jane waited until this ebullition of feeling in some degree abated, and then said, in a tone still more tender than that in which she had first spoken,-- ""Ellen, dear sister! tell me what has happened?"" ""I am foolish, sister,"" at length, said Ellen, looking up, and endeavoring to dry her. ""That is bad, Ellen,"" replied Jane, while a shadow fell upon her face, but a few moments before so glowing and happy. Henry was discharged from the shop this morning; and now, what are we to do? We have nothing ahead, and I am afraid he will not be able to. Jane sat down with Ellen, and began to discuss the matter with earnestness and affection. After a while, each grew more composed and less reserved; and then the whole matter was talked over. ""What have you there?"" at length asked Ellen, glancing towards the chair upon which Jane had laid her bundle. ""Only a pair of blankets, and a couple of calico dresses that I have been out buying,"" said Jane. ""Let me look at them,"" said Ellen, in as cheerful a voice as she could.. Jane felt that such thoughts must pass through her sister's mind, and she also felt much pained that she had undesignedly added, by contrast, to Ellen's unhappy feelings. When she returned home, she put away her new dresses and her blankets. She had no heart to look at them, noHeart to enjoy her own good things, while the sister she so much loved was denied like present comforts, and, worse than all, weighed down with a heart-s. The sisters were separated for ten years. They became estranged from each other. The sisters' lives were separated by a distance of a thousand miles. The two sisters were not the same people. They were different people, with different feelings. The difference between them was that they were not like each other, but of different kinds. They had different feelings, and were not alike. The differences between them showed the tendency of good or bad principles, united with good or good habits. The contrast between the sisters was that the sisters were of different minds and feelings.. Thorne's family was reduced to poverty in its most appalling form. The habit of idleness he had suffered to creep at a slow but steady pace upon him. Idleness brought intemperance, and intempered, reacting upon idleness, completed his ruin, and reduced his family to poverty. Thorne's wife and two children, a boy and a girl, were seated listlessly on the. ""Mother!"" said the little boy, getting up from the floor, where he had been sitting for half an hour, as still as if he were sleeping. ""Can't I have a piece of bread, mother?"" ""What, my child?"" the mother said, stooping down and kissing his forehead, while she parted with her fingers the golden hair that fell in tangled masses over it. ""What is wrong with you?"" he asked. ""I'm sick with a southern fever,"" she. The author's sister, who had not seen her in years, was in a state of grief. She had lost her husband, who was killed in a car accident. She was left with her sister's body, which had been taken by a train. She and her sister were taken to the hospital, where they were given food and water. They were then taken home, and she was given a piece of her brother's cake. She gave it to her sister, and they ate it together, as a sign of respect for each other. She said: ""I love you, my sister, I love you so much"". William Moreland was a farmer in the village of Dorset, England. He was a friend of Ellen, the blind woman who lived in his cottage. Ellen had been forced to leave her home because of her health. William Moreland helped her care for the woman. He also helped her take care of the blind man, who she called 'the poor old blind man' He also took care of her son, who was also a farmer, and her daughter-in-law, who were also in the house. The story was told in a book called 'The Blind Man's Story'. William Moreland's wife, Ellen, received a letter from a neighbor. The neighbor brought the letter to Ellen's home. Ellen's daughter, Jane, read the letter and was moved to tears. Ellen, in tears, said: ""The Lord has blessed us with plenty, and something to spare for his needy children"" The letter was returned to Ellen, and Ellen was happy to receive the letter. The letter has been published in a book called ""The Letter from. Jane Moreland received a letter from her sister Ellen in September. Ellen had been separated from her husband, Henry, for some time. Jane wondered how her sister and her children were doing. She read the letter and felt sick. She sent it to her husband. He read it and sent it back to her. She was shocked. She had not expected to hear from Ellen again. The letter was returned to her sister. She felt sick again. She feared for her sister's safety.. ""You are good, kind and noble-hearted, William!"" exclaimed Jane, bursting into tears. ""I can't bear to see others suffering, and never will, if I can afford relief,"" he said. ""Poor Ellen! I fear she has suffered much,"" said Jane. ""And surely, if industry brought no other reward, the power it gives us to benefit and relieve others, is enough to make us ever active,"" said William. ""You are a good man, William,"" said Ellen. ""A good man,"" replied William, ""and a noble man."". . ""I don't know which is the gainer over the other, I or Ellen,"""

""Yes, love,"" was the unhesitating reply. ""Eddy must be a good boy, and mind nurse while mam. Eddy returned to the nursery, strong in his purpose, to be a good boy, as he had promised. ""Such a dear little picture-book as mamma is going to bring me home,"" he said to nurse. ""Oh! won't I be so glad. It's to be just like cousin Edie's"". Eddy's nurse told him that his mamma wouldn't be home for a long time yet. But that instant the door bell rung. Eddy bounded from the room, and his little feet were heard pattering down the stairs. After a little while he came back, and with a look of disappointment on his sweet young face, said, as he did so: ""It was only a. ""I'm tired of block houses,"" replied the little boy, ""and now that mamma has promised me a picture-book like cousin Edie's I can't think of anything else"" ""Oh, well,"" said nurse, a little impatiently, ""she'll be home in good time. Try and not think of the book. It won't do any good--it won't bring. Mrs. Herbert had scarcely passed into the street, ere her promise was forgotten. The request for a picture book seemed to her but the expression of a sudden thought. She was an indulgent mother, and rarely said ""No,"" to any request that might reasonably be gratified. There was will, therefore, in her promise. The child's request but seconded this thought. He went down into the parlor, and seating himself at the window, watched, with childish eagerness, for the form of his mother.. Mrs. Herbert meant to do as she had said. But things of more interest to Mrs. Herbert, than the simple wish of a child, so fully occupied her mind from the time she left her own door, that she never again thought of the book, until she saw Eddy's dear face at the window. It was serious, and slightly impatient, as if he were wearied with watching and waiting; but the. Mrs. Herbert's grave tone and look caused a shiver to pass inward toward the heart of the child. He understood, but too well, that the mother, whose word he had trusted so implicitly, had been faithless to her promise. The happy countenance of her child did not bring joy to the mother's heart. She knew that with a word, she must dash to the ground all his buoyant anticipations.. ""Eddy, you know you promised me to be such a good boy,"" said Mrs. Herbert. ""And I have been good,"" eagerly answered the little fellow, lifting his swimming eyes to her face. ""You may ask nurse if I havn't been good all the time,"" he added. ""Now, Eddy! I can't have this!"" Mrs. . ""Eddy, you must stop this crying!"" Firmness had changed to sternness. ""Crying will do no good. I promised you the book, and you shall have it. I had no opportunity to get it this morning. Come now! You must stop at once, or I----"" The sound of the latch-key was heard in the street door.. ""Bless us! what's the trouble here?"" the father of Eddy exclaimed, good-naturedly, as he presented himself in the parlor. ""The trouble is,"" said Mrs. Herbert, in a fretful voice, ""that I promised to buy him a book, and forgot all about it"". Eddy's mother left the room when he was born. When she returned, her countenance wore a sober aspect and there were signs of tears about her eyes. What her thoughts had been, every true mother can better imagine than we describe. No promise, not even the lightest, was ever afterwards made to her child, which was not righte"

Dear little Willie! I fear I love him too much"" Mr. Morton was a wealthy merchant of Philadelphia, and a liberal patron of the arts. He had, already, obtained several pictures from Sully, who was, with him, as an artist, a great favourite. The last order had just been sent home. It was a portrait of his youngest, and favourite child--a sweet little boy, upon whose head three summers had not yet smiled.. ""Every one who is able,"" remarked Mr. Morton, ""should have the portraits of his children taken. What better legacy could a father leave to his child, than the image of his own innocent face?"" ""The good impressions made in infancy and childhood, are rarely if ever lost,"" said Mrs. Morton. ""They come back upon every one at times, and are, frequently, all-powerful in the influence they exert against evil"" ""We may look back and see our Willie's face when but a child,"" said the artist. ""And every year he will be changing and changing; but this cannot alter, and even from. ""How like a spell to call back those innocent thoughts and affections, would be the image of a man's face in childhood! No one, it seems to me, could resist its influence."" Disease fastened upon the child, and ere the parents, and fond sisters of a younger and only brother, were fully sensible of danger, the spirit of the child had fled. We will not linger to pain the reader with any minute description of the deep and abiding grief that fell, like a shadow from an evil wing overspreading them, upon the household of Mr. Morton. Instead, we move on to scenes more exciting, if not less moving to the heart.. ""He was too pure and too lovely for the earth,"" she said, one day, to her husband, about two months after his death. ""Then do not grieve for him,"" Mr. Morton replied in a soothing tone. ""We know that he is with the angels, and where they are, is neither evil, nor sorrow, nor pain"" But the loss of their child seemed but the beginning of sorrows to Mr. and Mrs. Morton. ""Our picture cannot die. And though it is mute and inanimate, yet it is something to awaken remembrances, that, even though sad, we delight. An unexpected series of failures in business so fatally involved him, that extrication became impossible. He was an honest man, and therefore, this sudden disastrous aspect of affairs was doubly painful, for he knew no other course but the honourable giving up of everything. After opening the sad news to his wife, he called his family around him. ""My dear children,"" he said, ""I have painful news to break to you; but you cannot know it too soon. Owing to a succession of heavy failures, my business has become embarrassed beyond hope. I must give up all,--even our comfortable and elegant home must be changed for one less expensive, and less comfortable. Can you. ""Yes, dear father! be they what they may,"" Constance, the eldest, a young lady in her seventeenth year, said, looking up affectionately through her tears. Mary, next in years, pressed up to her father's side, and twining an arm around his neck, kissed his forehead tenderly. She did not speak; for her heart was too full; but it needed no words to assure him that her love was as true as the needle to the pole. Eliza, but twelve, and like an unfolding bud half revealing the loveliness and beauty within, could not fully comprehend the whole. ""Trust us, father,"" was the calm, earnest, affectionate reply of Constance. ""I feel as if I could say, With my father I could go unto prison or to death."" ""And now,"" he said, ""I am here to assign everything to you"" ""I earnestly hope that your hearts may not fail you while passing through the deep waters,"" he added. ""Think that by your patience and cheerfulness, your father's burdens will be lightened"" ""He cannot see you pained without suffering a double pang himself,"" said the father.. ""I can only hope for success in my future exertions, and pledge that success in anticipation. Can I do more?"" ""We could not ask for more certainly,"" was the cold response of a single individual. ""Appoint your trustees, and I am ready at any moment,"" said Mr. Morton. ""Trustees were accordingly appointed, and these had a private conference with, and received their instructions from the creditors"" In a week they commenced their work of appraisement. They found that the debtor had lost what they valued, above everything else--their money.. The trustees examined accounts, deeds, mortgages, and documents of various kinds. They found that the property represented by these would cover ninety cents in the dollar. Mr. Morton bowed and said, while his heart sunk in his bosom, ""To-morrow I will be ready for that"". The debtor asked the trustees for a day to prepare his family. The trustees looked at each other, and hesitated. Morton replied, while a red spot burned upon his cheek. ""I am ready now,"" he said, after a few moments of hurried self-communion. ""Then you are afraid that I will make way, in the mean time, with some of my plate!"" The trustees replied, ""I did not say so, Mr. Morton. But, you know we are under oath"". ""Do not distress yourself, dear father!"" Constance said, laying her hand upon his shoulder. ""The sooner it is over the better."" ""May he who watches over, and regards us all, bless you, my children!"" the father said with emotion, and hurriedly left them. ""That is from Guido,"" he said, looking admiringly at a sweet picture, which had always been a favourite of Mr. Guido's. ""I have always loved that picture,"" he added, ""and it is a very good one."". ""A proof, as I live! from the only plate worth looking at of Raphael's Madonna of St. Sixtus,"" says the connoisseur. ""And here is 'Our Saviour,' from Da Vinci's celebrated picture of the Last Supper; and a 'Magdalen' from Correggio. You are a judge of pictures, I see, Mr. Morton! But what is this. The trustees were examining a portrait of Willie Morton. Mr. Morton's heart leaped with a new and sudden fear. The trustees said they could not pass the portrait. The portrait was worth at least two hundred dollars. The trustee said they should be censured, and justly too, if they were to pass it. The board decided to pass the picture. The picture was returned to the trustees, and the case was closed. The Trustee said he would like to see the portrait again, but could not.. Mr. Morton's thoughts were so bewildered and his feelings so benumbed by the sudden and unexpected shock, that he could not rally his mind enough to decide what to say or how to act. To have the unfeeling hands of creditors, under the sanction of the law, seize upon his lost Willie's portrait, was to him so unexpected and sacrilegious a thing, he could scarcely realize it. He stood wrapt in painful, dreamy abstraction, until roused by the direction, given to the appraiser, by one of the trustees.. Sick at heart, Mr. Morton turned from them and sought his family. The distressed, almost agonized expression of his countenance was noticed. For a few minutes he sat with them, and then, recovering in some degree, his self-possession, he returned and kept with the trustees, until everything in the house that could be taken, was valued. But in the name of humanity spare me the portrait of my angel boy."". The Morton family were left poor, indeed. They were left with nothing but the barest necessaries for housekeeping. The mother and daughters rose to their feet, with blanched cheeks, and eyes staring wildly into the father's face. ""O no, not Willie's portrait, surely!"" the mother at length said, mournfully. ""I would not care, if they had only left us Willie's portraits!"". ""I will take it away this very night, where they can never find it,"" Mary said indignantly. ""That would be doing wrong my child,"" Mr. Morton replied. ""I owe these men, and this picture, they say, will bring a hundred and fifty dollars"" ""There is no law to protect us in keeping it,"" he said. ""Let us, then, my dear children, resolve to keep our consciences clear of wrong, and endeavor patiently to bear with our afflictions"" ""We cannot give that up. It is of no comparative value to others, and is. ""This severest trial of all, if patiently borne, will, I am sure, result in good"" - Shakespeare. Shakespeare's son Willie was killed in a car crash in 1858. The family moved to a small house at the northern extremity of the city, and furnished it with the scanty furniture that, as an insolvent debtor, the law allowed him to claim. The portrait of Willie still hung in the parlour where still hung Willie's sweet portrait, and the family gathered to remember him in the room. The story of Willie's death is told in the play The Death of Willie by Shakespeare.. The family of Mr. Morton and his family moved into their new home. The family were looking at a picture of a child when they were approached by a stranger. The child's calm, innocent face had for their eyes a melancholy beauty. They gazed upon it until every cheek was wet, and every heart oppressed. The boy was a boy of about six years old, and was the son of Mr Morton and Mrs Morton. The couple were to be married in the following year.. The family were gathered in one of the chambers, sad, gloomy, and silent. A servant came in and said that Mr. Wilkinson was below and wished to see Miss Constance. ""It is cruel for him to come here so soon,"" she said bursting into tears. ""You can do no less than see him Constance,"" her mother said. ""Do not lose that consciousness of internal truth of character which alone can sustain you in your new relations"" ""You are not changed, even if outward circumstances are no longer as they were. And if Mr Wilkinson does not regard these do not you you?"". ""We have only met as friends,"" Constance replied, while her voice trembled in spite of her efforts to be calm. ""Remember, that, all that is of real worth in you remains. Adversity cannot rob you of your true character"" ""Then I will see him, and try to meet him as I should, though I feel that the task will be a hard one,"" she replied. ""Your mother has spoken well and wisely,"" Mr. Morton said. ""If he still wishes your society, or ours. ""Pardon me,"" he said advancing and taking her hand as she entered, ""for so soon intruding upon you after the sad change in your condition. But I should have been untrue to the kind feelings I bear yourself and family, had I, from a principle of false delicacy, staid away. I trust I shall be none the less welcome now than before."" ""We must all esteem the kindness that prompted your visit,"" Constance replied with a strong effort to subdue the troubled emotions within, and which were but too plainly indicated.. ""Can I hope for a return of like sentiment, Constance?"" he at length said, tenderly. She burst into tears, but did not attempt to withdraw her hand. Mr. Wilkinson made offers of marriage, which, being accepted, he urged an immediate consummation. Delay was asked, but he was so earnest, that all parties agreed that the wedding should take place in three days. In three days the rite was said, and Wilkinson, one of the most prosperous young merchants of Philadelphia, left for New York.. ""Where are we going?"" Constance asked, as they entered a carriage on landing from the steamboat. ""To our own house, of course!"" was her husband's reply. ""You didn't tell me that you had taken a house, and furnished it."" ""Didn't I?"" ""You hardly thought that I was so simple as to catch a bird without having a cage first provided for it?"" ""I had but little time to get the cage,"" thought Constance, but she did not utter the thought.. Mr. Wilkinson, who was comparatively wealthy, was just on the eve of making proposals for the hand of Constance Morton, when the sudden reverse overtook her father. When he saw the sale of the house and furniture announced, he determined to buy all in at any price. On the day of the sale, he bid over every competitor. He proposed a partnership with the latter, but she said: ""But I have nothing, you know, Mr. Wilkinson. Mr. Wilkinson, I am not rich, but I have a good heart."". ""You have established business habits, and extensive knowledge of the operations of trade, and a large business acquaintance. With your co-operation in my business, I can double my profits. Will you join me?"" ""It were folly, Mr. Wilkinson, to say nay,"" Mr. Morton replied. ""Then I will announce the co-partnership at once,"" he said. ""And it was announced before the day of marriage, but Constance did not see it."""

Lawson said he had a business matter to attend to, and that he would. ""Gold hides a multitude of defects, you know, Fred."" ""I would be ashamed of her in company a dozen times a day if she were any thing to me."" ""She certainly hasn't good common sense"" ""She will grow older and wiser"" ""At a boarding school some thirty miles. ""I could not have asked him to do a thing more consonant with my wishes,"" continued Lawson. ""Caroline told me where she was going, and I was not long in making a visit to the neighborhood"" ""We met in a certain retired glen, where the sweet quiet of nature was broken only by the dreamy murmur of. Lawson: ""It is hopeless to think of gaining her father's consent to a marriage. He is pence-proud, and I, as you know, am penniless"" Williams: ""I do not think he would be likely to fancy you for a son-in-law"". ""I'll manage all that. What I want you to do is, first, to engage me rooms at Howard's, and, second, to meet me at the boat, day after to-morrow, with a carriage"" ""I will, certainly,"" said Williams.. Charles Lawson was a young man having neither principle nor character. He looked with a cold, calculating baseness to marriage as the means whereby he was to gain the position at which he aspired. He approached one young school girl after another, until he found in Caroline Everett one weak enough to be flattered by his attentions.. Caroline's meetings with Lawson were not continued long before he became aware of the fact, and he at once removed her to a school at a distance from the city. Lawson could have desired no better arrangement, so far as his wishes were concerned. Caroline was taking her morning walk with two or three companions, when she noticed a mark on a certain tree, which she knew as a sign that her lover. ""I cannot bear this separation. It makes me wretched,"" said Lawson. ""And I am miserable,"" responded Caroline, with a sigh, and her eyes fell to the. Caroline leaned toward the young man, but did not reply. Lawson asked: ""Is there any hope of his being induced to give his consent to--to--our--union?"" ""None, I fear,"" came from the lips of Caroline.. Caroline was to be taken to New York by her father. Lawson said that his father was a man of tender feelings. He said that if they precipitate a union, his opposition would grow weak. Caroline said that her father loved her too well.. Caroline was prepared for it; and, in the blindness of a mistaken love, ready to do as the tempter wished. Poor lamb! She was to be led to the slaughter, decked with ribbons and garlands, a victim by her own consent. Frederick Williams, the friend of Lawson, was a young attorney, who had fallen into rather wild company.. ""I will have no part nor lot in this matter,"" he said, mentally. But not long did his mind rest easy under his assumed passive relation to a contemplated social wrong, that one word from him might prevent it. He found his sister waiting for him, and, as his eyes rested upon her innocent young countenance,. The day passed with him uncomfortably enough. The more he thought about the matter, the more he felt troubled. In the evening, he met his sister again, and the sight of her made him more deeply conscious of the. Williams learned that there was a writ out against the person of Charles Lawson on a charge of swindling. The thought of his own sister was instantly associated with the scheme of some false-hearted wretch. He felt that the man who knew that another was plotting against her, and did not apprize him of the fact, was little less than a villain at heart.. Caroline was a woman, with the mind of an inexperienced child. All her ideas were false or exaggerated. She was confident that all would be forgiven after the first outburst of anger on the part of her father, and that they would be taken home immediately. She moved forward with a joyful confidence. Caroline was confident.. Lawson's marriage to Caroline was to be performed in a private parlor. The ceremony was to take place in the parlor, which was also the chamber where the wedding would take place. The wedding took place in a house called Howard's, which is now owned by Lawson's family. Lawson's wife, Caroline, was a wealthy heiress who was to marry Lawson.. Doubts as to the propriety of what she was about doing, came fast upon her mind. In the nearness of the approaching event, she could look upon it stripped of its halo of romance. Her father's anger, the grief of her mother, the unknown state upon which she wasabout entering, all came pressing upon her thoughts.. Caroline was to marry Charles Lawson. She was in tears as she waited for the ceremony to begin. Lawson was confounded by her sudden change of heart. He told her to go to her father the moment the ceremony was over. She refused and wept in his arms.. ""Charles?"" said Caroline, with a suddenly constrained calmness--""do you love me?"" ""Better than my own life!"" was instantly replied. ""Then take me to my father. I am too young--too weak--too inexperienced for this."". Caroline was forced into the next room. The clergyman began to read the service. Caroline felt like one driven forward by a destiny against which it was vain to contend. ""I will not hold you back an instant,"" said the clergyman. ""Let me go now, Charles! Oh, let me go!"". Caroline Everett was arrested by her father for swindling. She was in her father's arms, and both were weeping. Had her father been delayed a few moments longer, she would have become the wife of a man soon after condemned to expiate his crimes against society in the felon's cell.. ""Not once in a hundred instances, is a school girl approached with lover-"

Mr. Lyon asked his wife to raise money to pay off the arrears of rent for Mrs. Arnold. Mrs. Lyon replied that she would be happy to do so. Mr. Lyon said that he could make the collections himself.. Andrew Lyon, a friend of the widow, decided to help her out. He decided to raise her rent by subscription. He enlisted the help of a number of friends. The widow's landlord had threatened to put her things in the street if she didn't pay.. ""I want just one dollar from you, and as much more from some eight or nine as benevolent as yourself,"" said Malcolm Lyon. Andrew Lyon replied: ""Nothing for me, but something for a poor widow, who is behind with her. Andrew Lyon's ardor of benevolent feelings suddenly cooled at this unexpected reception. He entered his place of business with far less confidence than he had felt when calling upon Malcolm.. Andrew Lyon, a poor man, was given two dollars by Andrew Green. Lyon was embarrassed by the gesture. Green said, ""He's got a dollar out of me; may it do him, or the poor widow he. ""Catch me at this work again!"" he said, half aloud, as his thoughts dwelt upon what had so recently occurred. ""But this is not right,"" he added, quickly. ""It is a weakness in me to feel so"". Andrew Lyon started to see this individual off Andrew Lyon. ""I've come begging, Mr. Jones,"" said he, on meeting him. Lyon: ""I only want a dollar to help a poor widow pay her. Lyon returned to his shop, still more disheartened than before. He had undertaken a thankless office. ""There's no compulsion in the matter,"" he said.. ""I am trying to get ten persons, including myself, to give a dollar each."" ""Well, here's my dollar."" ""I hope you will not trouble me again in this way."". The writer says that many people are not willing to give up their time or money for charity. He says it is a mistake to think that charity is easy and that it is not a duty to help others..

""I am convinced, from close observation of Walter Gray,"" said Jane, ""that he has in his character that which should ever protect him from jest or ridicule"" Cara responded, in a tone of. ""I was really disgusted with his marked disregard of the little courtesies of social life,"" says Cara. ""He has not mingled enough in society to give him confidence,"" adds Jane.. ""And pray, who is the perfect gentleman?"" asked Jane smiling. ""Is he one of my acquaintances?"" ""Certainly he is. I mean. ""What do you know of Charles Wilton, that will warrant your throwing out such insinuations against him?"" ""Little beyond what I have learned by my own observation,"" replied Jane. ""Trust me, my friend, he is. ""Surely, Cara, long before this you have or ought to have discovered, that Charles Wilton exhibits far too much love of appearance for a sensible man,"" said her friend. ""His love of dress is a mere foible, that may. ""If he was simply fond of dress, and indulged in that fondness even to the extent he now does it might indicate a mere weakness of character, in the form of an undue love of admiration"" ""He has not the capacity. ""I should think any woman ought to be able to enjoy the company of a man of sense,"" Jane remarked. ""Certainly I do, Cara,"" replied Cara. ""I can't for my life, see how you can enjoy his. Jane Emory and Cara Linton had been law students for some years in the same office. They were friends, though altogether unlike each other. Walter Gray was modest and retiring, while Charles Wilton was a dashing, off-hand fellow.. Wilton was one of those dashing young men to be met with in all professions. He was vain of his personal appearance, and was also fond of pleasure and company. Wilton could make an effective, brilliant speech, and in ordinary cases, where an appeal. ""I suppose you are going to Mrs. Melton's this evening?"" said Wilton to his friend, a few weeks after the period indicated in the opening of this story. ""I feel as if I would like to go. A social evening, now and then,. ""I fear I am too old now to have all the rough corners knocked off, and worn smooth"" ""You'll make a ladies' man after awhile, if you persevere, and become more particular in your dress"". ""You are too matter-of-fact, by half, Walter. Your common sense ideas, as you call them, will keep you grubbing in a mole hill all your life"" ""I should like to see the woman you would. ""Common sense! Common sense! common sense! That is your hobby. Verily, Walter, you are a monomaniac on the subject of common sense."" ""I go in for uncommon sense."". ""You are behind the age, and a stranger to its powerful, onward impulses"" ""The brilliant meteor attracts a thousand times more attention, than the brightest star that shines in the firmament"" ""I have made up my mind to. ""I shall certainly be true to myself, Walter. For what pray do we toil over dry and musty law books in a confined office, months and years, if not to gain the power. Charles Wilton was a young man. He was in the employ of Walter Gray. Wilton wanted to meet a young woman. Gray was a sensible man, and knew Wilton well.. ""Wilton is quite the centre of attraction for the young ladies, this evening,"" remarked Jane Emory, who was leaning upon the arm of Walter Gray. ""And he seems to enjoy it. ""I admit the truth of what you say, and yet, the state is one to which I have not yet attained"" ""We should be governed by some higher end than the mere love of admiration--even admiration for good qualities"". ""I try to subdue in me what is evil, or that which seems to me to act in opposition to good principles,"" she said. Charles Wilton, with Cara Linton on his. ""Well, Gray, the business is all settled,"" said Wilton, one day, coming into the office of the individual he addressed so familiarly. ""Why, I've won the rich and beautiful Miss Linton,"" he said.. ""You are what some would call a lucky dog,"" said Wilton, with a smile. ""And yet there is no luck in it. 'Faint heart, they say, 'never won fair. ""She is the most sensible women it has yet been my fortune to meet,"" Wilton said. ""She is a genius, Walter. When. ""I am surprised, and I must say pained, to hear you speak thus"" Surely you love the young lady you propose to marry?"" ""Of course. Not a great. ""I would doubt, if I could, Charles,"" said Walter Gray. ""I am. Charles Wilton and Cara Linton were married in May of 1881. Walter Gray and Jane Emory were married three months later. The wedding was a splendid affair, succeeded by parties and entertainments for five or. The Melton's are sitting alone in one of their richly furnished parlors. Wilton yawns out his fatigue. ""Is there no place where we can go. Wilton asked his wife to go to the Grogans. She said she didn't want to go. Wilton said he was in no humor for music to-night. Charles Wilton and his wife were about to go to Mr. Grogan's. His wife asked him if he was willing to go. He said he was not, but that. Walter Gray and his wife Jane were at a friend's house. They were both gay, and seemed as happy, as the gayest and the happiest.. ""I am sure that I would a thousand times rather remain at home and read with you a pleasant book, or sing and play for you, than to spend an evening away from our pleasant home"" ""Suppose, then, we call over and see how they are. ""Poor Mrs. Wilton!"" remarked Mrs. Gray, now a cheerful, intelligent woman of forty. ""It makes me sad whenever I see her, or think of her."" ""Her husband was not kind to her, I believe, while she lived with him,"" said. ""It was thought at one time that Mr. Wilton would lead in the profession here,"" says the author. ""He flashed before the eyes of the crowd for awhile, but it was soon discovered that he had more brilliancy than substance"". ""Ah me! it must be a wrong beginning that makes so sad an ending"" ""I could not but mark the painful contrast in her spirits"" ""She was listless or unhappy"". Judge Gray heard the news at the same time as the lawyer. Wilton had committed a forgery. The newspapers will announce the fact to-day.. ""He has lived by gambling these six years,"" continued the lawyer, ""and I suppose he has committed this forgery to pay some '. ""Poor Cara! It will break her heart,"" Judge Gray said in a sad tone. Without industry, legal knowledge, or sound principles of action, what was he. Charles Wilton was found guilty of forgery. His wife was also found guilty. Wilton asked his friend to go and see his wife. ""This last blow, I fear, will be too much for one who"

""Hush, dear Edward!"" returned the gentle girl, who had left father, mother, and a pleasant home, to share the lot of him she loved. ""For your sake, I would not touch a shilling of his money if I starved."" ""I cannot endure this life much longer,"" said the man. ""The native independence of my character revolts at our present condition"" ""I would rather die than live in this miserable abode,"" said Agnes.. The room in which they were overlooked the sea. In this country every avenue is crowded. ""But there is another land, where, if what we hear be true, ability finds employment and talent a sure reward"" ""I will cross the ocean to seek a better fortune in that land of promise,"" said Edward. ""I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee!"" said Agnes. ""Where thou goest I will go, and where thou liest I will lie"" ""The separation, painful to both, will not, I trust, be long."" ""Yes,"" replied the young wife with enthusiasm.. ""Would you forsake all,"" said Edward, in surprise, ""and go far away with me into a strange land?"" ""It will be no stranger to me than it will be to you, Edward,"" said Agnes Marvel. ""If I go to that land of promise, it must first be alone,"" he said. ""We will not think of that,"" she replied. ""Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God."" ""I cannot help thinking of it, Edward. Therefore entreat me not to leave thee, nor to return from following after thee"" ""I will not!"" he said, ""but think, Agnes!"". Marvel's countenance became more serious. ""Agnes,"" said the young man, after he had reflected for some time, ""let us think no more about this. We will go back to London. Perhaps another trial there may be more successful"" After a feeble opposition on the part of Agnes, it was finally agreed that Edward should go once more to London, while she made a brief visit to her parents. If he found employment, she was to join him immediately; if not successful, they were then to talk further of the journey to America. But, as yet, he had found no employment. A week elapsed before another letter came from Edward. But the tone of this letter was as cheerful and as hopeful as it was possible for the young boy to write.. Edward Marvel, a young man, wrote a letter to his wife, asking for her hand in marriage. He had been at sea for a few days when he became seriously ill. He was unable to rise from his berth, and spent the rest of the voyage in bed. Marvel's letter was returned to him after five weeks, and he was able to leave for New York. He wrote: ""The moment I obtain employment, I will send for you, and then our re-union will take place with a fulness of delight such as we have not yet experienced"" The letter was sent to Marvel's wife, Anne Marvel, and was received by Anne Marvel with great joy.. ""Have you friends in this country?"" inquired a nurse who was attending the young man. Then he was removed to the sick wards of the hospital on Staten Island. Marvel was an inmate of a hospital in London. He had friends in England, but had no way of contacting them. He asked a nurse for a pen and paper to write a letter to them. The nurse gave him a pen, but he was too ill to write. He wrote a few lines, but was too weak to continue. He died soon after. The story was published in a book of the same name in the 1930s.. ""Marvel--Marvel?"" the nurse shook her head. ""There's a young woman down in the office inquiring for a person of that name"" ""I'm certain there is no one by that name for whom any here would make inquiries,"" replied the nurse. ""But he has no friends in this country,"" said the physician.. ""Your name is Marvel?"" asked the nurse. ""Yes."" ""A young woman was here just now inquiring if we had a patient by that name."" ""By my name?"" There was a slight indication of surprise. ""Did you see her?"" he asked at length, evincing some interest. He closed his eyes, and did not speak for some moments. ""There is no person here, except yourself, whose name came near to the one she mentioned"" ""Yes,"" he said. ""I did."". Marvel looked up quickly into the face of the attendant, while a flush came into his cheeks. ""No, no."" And the sick man shook his head slowly. ""There is none to ask for me"" ""Will you write?"" said the nurse after some moments. The invalid, without unclosing his eyes, slowly shook his heads. ""That cannot be. I left her far away over the wide ocean."" ""You have no friends in this country,"" said the attendant. ""We did not suppose that you were meant."". ""Dear, dear Agnes!"" murmured Edward Marvel, closing his eyes, and letting his thoughts go, swift-winged, across the billow sea. ""Shall I never look on your sweet face again? Never feel your light arms about my neck, or your breath warm on my cheek? Oh, that I had never left you! Heaven give thee strength to bear the trouble in store!"" For many minutes he lay thus, alone, with his eyes closed. ""Agnes!"" was his quick response, while his arms were thrown eagerly around the neck of his wife. ""Agnes! Agnes! Have I awakened from a fearful dream?"" ""Yes, it was indeed her of whom he had been thinking,"" she replied. ""I will always love you,"" she said. ""And I will always be with you,"" he replied. 'I will never forget you,' she said, and kissed him. ""Yes,"" he said. 'And I'll always loveYou.' ""Yes. I will forever love you."" ""Yes."" ""I'll always remember you,"" said she, ""and I will never be without you."". Two weeks before the ship in which Edward Marvel sailed reached her destination, Agnes was in New York. Before her departure, she had sought, but in vain, to discover the name of the vessel in which her husband had embarked. On arriving in the New World, she was therefore uncertain whether he had preceded her in a steamer, or was still lingering on the way. The friends to whom Agnes brought letters received her with great kindness, and gave her all the advice and assistance needed under the circumstances. But two weeks went by without a word of intelligence on the one subject that absorbed all her thoughts. Sadly was her health beginning to suffer. Sunken eyes and pale cheeks attested the weight of suffering that was on her. One day it was announced that a Liverpool packet had arrived with the. Marvel had been a passenger on board of this vessel; but, from some cause, nothing in regard to him beyond this fact could she learn. Against all persuasion, she started for the hospital, her heart oppressed with a fearful presentiment that he was either dead or struggling in the grasp of a fatal malady. On making inquiry at the hospital she was told the one she sought was not there, and she was about returning to the city, when the truth reached her ears. Tears sprung to her eyes at the thought of not being permitted to come near in his extremity. ""Do not say that. Oh, take me to him! I will save his life."". Edward Marvel and Agnes met a month from this time in New York. ""The least excitement may be fatal,"" he said. ""Oh, I will be calm and prudent."" Yet, even while she spoke, her frame quivered with excitement. ""What would I not suffer for your sake?"" she asked him. ""It is, thus far, no better with me than when we left our old home"" ""I would, in all probability, now be sleeping the sleep of death!"" he replied. ""But for your prompt resolution to follow me across the sea, I would, by all means, be alive!"". ""Let not your heart be troubled,"" said she, with a beautiful smile. ""All will come out right."" ""No, not an angel,"" calmly replied Agnes, ""only a wife"" ""Never again, in any extremity, think for a moment of meeting trials or enduring privations alone,"" she added. ""A good place awaits you so soon as strength to fill it comes back to your weakened frame."" ""Angel!"" exclaimed the young man, overcome with emotion at so unexpected a declaration. ""No. Not an angel."" ""Only a wife. Only a wife."" ""I have already made warm friends here, and, through them, secured for you employment. ""Angel! Yes, you are my good angel,"" repeated Edward. ""Call me what you will,"" said Agnes, with a sweet smile, as she brushed, with her delicate hand, the hair from his temples. ""But let me"

""No man is more willing to give than I am, if I only knew where and when to give"" ""Virtuous want is, in most cases, unobtrusive, and will suffer rather than extend a hand for relief"" ""We must seek for objects of benevolence in by-places"" ""If we look around us carefully, Mr. Edwards,"" returned the Quaker, we need be at no loss on this subject. ""Objects enough will present themselves."" ""We need not look for the perfect solution to every problem,"" says the merchant, ""but for a beginning one can start with a beginning."". ""I have had my doubts whether any who exercise the abilities which God has given them, need want for the ordinary comforts of life in this country,"" he said. ""Evil of some kind is ever the cause of destitution and wretchedness,"" he added. ""Such bitter waters as these cannot flow from a sweet fountain. We must turn aside into untrodden walks."" ""In all cases of destitute, there is something wrong, you may depend upon it,"" he concluded. ""It is the duty of those who have enough and to spare, to stretch forth their hands to aid, comfort and sustain them"". The objects of benevolence are all around us, said the Quaker. Mere alms-giving, as thee has intimated, but too often encourages vice and idleness. But thee desires to find a worthy object of beneVolence. ""True benevolences does not always require us to give alms,"" said the Friend. ""We may do much to aid, comfort and help on with their burdens our fellow travellers, and yet not bestow upon them what is called charity"" ""We have but to open our eyes and see, Mr. Edwards,"" replied the Friend, ""the. The sale had already begun, and there was a small company assembled. Among them, the merchant noticed a young woman whose face was partially veiled. She was sitting a little apart from the rest, and did not appear to take any interest in the bidding. But he noticed that, after an article was knocked off, she was all attention until the next was put up, and then, the moment it was named, relapsed into a sort of listlessness or abstraction. The articles sold embraced a great variety of things useful and ornamental. They were sold for a total of £1,000. The sale was held at the home of a Quaker merchant.. The company bid with animation, and article after article was sold off. The interest at first awakened by the scene, new to the young merchant, wore off in a little while, and turning to his companion he said--""I don't see that much is to be gained by staying here."" The auctioneer took up a small gold locket containing a miniature, and holding it up, asked for a bid. He said: ""How much for this? How much forthis beautiful gold lockets and miniature? Give me a bid"" The Quaker replied: ""Wait a little longer, and perhaps thee will think differently,"" glancing towards the young woman who has been. Auctioneer: ""Will no one give four dollars for this beautiful gold locket and miniature? It's thrown away at that price"" ""One dollar,"" was the response from a man who stood just in front of the woman. ""Two dollars! One dollar!"" cried the auctioneer. ""Only one dollar for a gold lockets and miniature worth forty"" But there was no bid. ""Why, gentlemen, it never cost less than fifty! Four dollars! 4 dollars!"" continued the auctioneers. ""It's thrown Away at that Price!"". The auctioneer looked at the young woman's face and saw that she was trembling with eagerness and anxiety. The auctioneer then looked at a coarse-looking man, the only one who seemed disposed to bid against her. The man, resolutely, said: ""Twelve shillings is bid. One dollar!"" The girl replied: ""Eleven shilings!"" The auction was held in London's St James' Hall.. The auctioneer bids for a gold locket and miniature. The miniature is that of a middle-aged lady. The original is the mother of the young woman who seemed so anxious to possess the locket. The locket was pawned by the woman's mother. The merchant asks: ""Who pawned it? Did she?"" The auctioneer says: ""Fourteen! Once!---"" The woman shrinks back from her prominent position, yet still remains in the room. The man who was bidding bids for the miniature: ""Fourteen shillings is bid. Fourteen shilings! Are you all done?"". The auctioneer was bidding against a young woman for her virginity. The first bidder, seeing that Mr. Edwards was in the field, bid in opposition. The second bidder promptly bid for the girl. The auctioneer then started bidding against the girl again. The third bidder bid for her. The fourth bid was for her to be married. The fifth bid was to be for the child to be born.. Mr. Edwards was determined to run against him, and being a little afraid that he might be left with a ruinous bid on his hands, declined advancing. The locket was assigned to the young merchant, who, as soon as he had received it, turned and presented it to the woman, saying as he did so -- ""It is yours"" The young woman caught hold of it with an eager gesture, and after gazing on it for a few moments, pressed it to her lips. She said in a low sad voice, recovering herself in a few minutes, ""I have not the money to pay for it"". The more distinctly he recalled the young woman's face, the more strangely familiar did it seem. For a few moments he lingered in the street; but his companion not appearing, he went on his way, musing on the singular adventure he had encountered. About an hour afterwards, as Mr. Edwards sat reading a letter, the Quaker entered his store. ""Did you see anything more of that young woman?"" asked the merchant. ""Yes,"" replied the Quakers. ""I could not leave one like her without knowing something of her past life and present circumstances"" ""I think even you will hardly be disposed to regard her as an object unworthy of interest. ""She asked no aid; but, with the last few shillings that remained to her in the world, had gone to recover, if possible, an unredeemed pledge--the miniature of her mother. She had obtained a small advance of money to buy food and medicine for the dying original. This is but one of the thousand cases of real distress that are all around us. We could see them if we did but turn aside for a moment into ways unfamiliar to our feet"" ""I would have felt it as a stain upon my conscience to have left one like her uncared for in the circumstances under which we found her."" ""I learned the history of her past life and present condition. Does thee remember Belgrave?"". Mary Belgrave had secretly pawned a miniature to supply the last earthly need of her mother. But the pawn broker refused to renew it and Mary's mother died last week in abject poverty, leaving Mary friendless. Mary Belgrave's father died two years ago and her mother, who has been sick ever since, died last Tuesday. Mary's father had been sick with cancer for two years. Mary had pawned the miniature to redeem it for her mother but the time for which the pledge had been taken, expired, and the pawnbroker refused to renewed it.. The merchant had resumed his seat, and although he had listened attentively to the Quaker's brief history, he did not make any reply, but soon became lost in thought. The Friend answered the question, and, as Mr. Edwards did not seem inclined to ask any more, and besides fell back again into an abstract state, he wished him good morning and retired. The poor girl was sitting alone in her room sewing, late in the afternoon of the day on which the incident at the auction room occurred, musing, as she had mused for hours, upon the unexpected adventure. She did not, in the excitement of the moment, know Mr Edwards, but in her excitement she had not thought. Mary sat sewing, as we have said, late in the afternoon of the day on which the incident at the auction room occurred, when there was a tap at her door. On opening it, Mr. Edwards stood before her. She stepped back a pace or two in instant surprise and confusion, and he advanced into the desolate room. Mary recovered herself, and with as much self-possession as, under the circumstances, she could assume, asked her unexpected visitor to take a chair, which she offered him. He sat down, and she told him of the incident, and how she had been unable to keep the thought of him from her mind. She said she had loved him with the childish fondness of a young school-girl.. ""There is another unredeemed pledge,"" said Mr. Edwards, significantly, as he sat conversing with Mary about a year after she had found a home in the house of his aunt. Allusion had been made to the miniature of Mary's mother. Mary had no good reason for declining so kind an offer. It was a home that she most of all needed; and she could not refuse one like this. ""Ah!"" was the simple response. ""Yes"" was Mary's reply, ""Yes!"" ""Yes,"" said the young man, ""I am so happy to have you as my wife."". ""That was a mere girlish pledge,"" ventured Mary, with drooping eyes. ""But one that the woman will redeem,"" said Edwards confidently, raising the hand to his lips at the same time, and kissing it. Mary leaned involuntarily towards him; and he, perceiving the movement, drew his arm around her, and pressed his"
0.85,0.95,67.23560910307899,"""What has become of the Wightmans?"" I asked of my old friend Payson. I had returned to my native place after an absence of several years. Payson looked grave. ""All broken up now,"" was answered. ""He failed several years ago"" ""Some one told me that they were very poor"" said Payson, as he used the words ""very poor,"" giving to them more than ordinary meaning. ""I see him now and then, but I don't know what he is doing."" ""I havn't met any of them for a long time,"" he said. ""Nothing wrong with them, I hope"". ""You must dine with me to-day,"" says my friend. ""I want to have a long talk about old times,"" he says. ""Very poor"" -- I could not get the words out of my ears,"" he adds. ""Mrs. Payson will be glad to see you,"" says the friend. 'I promised to be with them,' says the man. 'We dine at three,' he says, 'and then we parted' 'I could notget them out ofmy mind,' says Mr. P Grayson. 'They were estimable people,' says Payson. 'It did seem peculiarly hard that they should have suffered misfortune' 'We are all in this together,' he adds, 'but we are not all in it together'. Payson's shop was in Old Town. Wightman had failed in business several years before, and was now living somewhere in Oldtown in a very poor way. ""They are miserably poor,"" said one of his old acquaintances. ""His girls take in sewing, I have heard,"" said a third, who spoke with a slight air of contempt, as if there were something disgraceful attached to needle-work, when pursued as a means of livelihood. ""Very poor! Ah me!"" the sigh was deep and involuntary. ""Glad to see you!"" Payson extended his hand with a show of cordiality, as he entered his store between two and three o'clock on the next day.. ""Business first,"" was my answer, as I took the proffered newspaper. ""Stand upon no ceremony with me,"" said Payson. ""Go to Wilson,"" said he hurriedly, ""and tell him to send me a check for five hundred without fail"" ""It is now too late to get the money any where else,"" he said. ""Don't linger a moment,"" said the clerk, ""it is twenty five minutes to three now"" ""Just finishing up my bank business,"" he replied. ""I am so much short in my bank payments, and that it is nowtoo late to getting the money"" ""I'm not a very good writer,"" said Mr. Payson, ""but I'm a good friend."" ""I've got a lot of stories to tell,"" he added. ""But I'm not very good at telling them. ""What a life for a man to lead,"" said my friend, turning to me with a contracted brow and a sober face. ""I sometimes wish myself on an island in mid ocean"" ""Mrs. Payson is delighted at the thought of seeing you,"" he said. ""You'll find my daughters quite grown up. Clara is in her twentieth year. You, of course, recollect her only as a school girl"" ""I'm forever on the street financiering--Financierering. How I hate the word! But come--they'll be waiting dinner for us"" ""How long is it since you were here? About ten years, if I'm not mistaken?"" ""Yes,"" he replied. ""Very well."" ""I'll be in touch with you soon."". The author's friend lived in a handsome house in Franklin street. The house was showily, not tastefully, furnished, and the same might be said of his wife and daughters. The air of their dwelling was that of cheerfulness and comfort. Now, though their ample parlors were gay with rich Brussels, crimson damask, and brocatelle, there was no genuine home feeling there. The last time I saw her, Mrs. Payson wore a mousseline de lain, of subdued colors, a neat lace collar around her neck, fastened with a small diamond pin, the marriage gift of her father.. Two daughters, dressed almost as flauntingly as their mother, were presented to the public. They were the first to be given the honour of being given a tour of the museum. The second was the first woman to be allowed to see the inside of the Museum of Fine Arts, which was opened to them on the day of their visit. The third was the last to be presented, and she was given the chance to see her mother. The last was to be the last, and the first was to meet her husband, who had been waiting for her. She was the only one to see him, and he was delighted to see his wife. He said: ""I am so happy to see you, my wife, and I am so pleased to have you with me."". The ladies had not adorned their persons, nor provided their dinner, to give me welcome and pleasure, but to exhibit to the eyes of their guest, their wealth, luxury, and social importance. I did not feel honored by the really sumptuous meal the Paysons had provided for their old friend; because it was clearly to be seen that no honor was intended. The honor was all for themselves. Mrs. Payson and her daughters, had, I could see, become envious as well as proud. They wanted a larger house, and more costly furniture in order to make as imposing an appearance as some others whom they did not consider half as good as themselves. Once or twice I referred to the Wightmans; but the ladies knew nothing of them, and seemed almost to have forgotten that such persons ever lived. The ladies seemed to have almost forgotten that they ever lived, and were so envious of their friends.. ""He that wants what he is not able to buy, is a poor man, if I understand the meaning of the term,"" said Payson. ""And he who lives beyond his income, as a good many of our acquaintances do to my certain knowledge, is poorer still"" ""Now don't get to riding that hobby, Mr. Payson,"" broke in my friend's wife, deprecatingly--""don't, if you please"" ""My wife and daughters think I am made of money,"" said he, once, half laughing. ""But if they knew how hard it was to get hold of, sometimes, they would be less free in spending."" ""I tell them I am a poorMan, comparatively speaking; but I might. ""Don't mind him,"" his wife said, ""he gets in these moods sometimes"" ""My wife and daughters get one view of life, and I another,"" he said. ""It is impossible for me to get money as fast as they wish to spend it"" ""I tell them that I am a poor man, but they smile in my face,"" he added. ""Ah! how difficult it is to correct an error when once made"" ""It's hardly polite, and, in the second place, it is by no means agreeable,"" he continued. ""I suppose it was my fault in the beginning, I suppose."" ""I'm not surprised at this after what I had witnessed, about his house,"" said his wife. ""Put the scenes and circumstances together, and how could it well be otherwise? My friend, thus re-acted upon, ventured no further remark on a subject"". ""I am poor--poorer, I sometimes think, than the humblest of my clerks,"" he said. ""He is never in want of a dollar, while I go searching about, anxious and troubled, for my thousands daily"" ""I remonstrate, but it avails not, for they don't credit what I say,"" he added. ""I must deny them, or meet inevitable ruin,"" he wrote. ""When I returned from his elegant home, there was no envy in my heart"" ""My family turn dissatisfied from the costly adornments of our spacious home, and sigh for richer furniture, and a larger and more showy mansion,"" he continued. ""If I were a millionaire, their ambition might be satisfied. Now, their ample wishes may not be filled"". A day or two afterwards, I saw Wightman in the street. He was so changed in appearance that I should hardly have known him, had he not first spoken. He looked in my eyes, twenty years older than when we last met. His clothes were poor, though scrupulously clean; and, on observing him more closely, I perceived an air of neatness and order, that indicates nothing of that disregard about external appearance which so often accompanies poverty. ""One of the secrets of happiness in this life,"" said he, ""is contentment with our lot. We rarely learn this in prosperity"" ""I am sorry to hear that it is not so well with you in worldly matters as when I left the city,"" he said.. ""I find it one of the most difficult of lessons. I do not hope to acquire it perfectly,"" he said. ""And you have learned it?"" said I. ""I have been trying to learn it,"" he answered, smiling. ""But I find it ... difficult"" ""I must own, that I prepared to go to the Wightmans with some misgivings as to the pleasure I should receive,"" he wrote. ""Almost every one of their old acquaintances, to whom I had addressed inquiries on the subject, spoke of them as ""very poor"" If Wightman could bear the change with philosophy, I hardly expected to find the same Christian resignation in his wife"". ""How glad I am to see you again!"" said Mrs. Wightman. Though a little subdued, and rather paler and thinner, her face had the old heart-warmth in it. The eyes were bright from the same cheerful spirit as before. ""I have ever enjoyed one of the pleasantest meals I've ever enjoyed,"" he said. ""It was a most pleasant meal,"" he added, ""and I've never had one like it before"" ""I've never been so happy in my whole life,"" said the author. ""And I've been through a lot of things in my life,"" added the author, ""but I've not been through as much as I was when I was a little boy."" ""It's a pity I can't write about it now,"" he wrote, ""because it's. ""How are you getting along now?"" I asked. ""Very well,"" was his cheerful reply. ""How little did old friends, who covered their neglect of this family with these words, know of their real state?"" ""Sweet peace folded her wings in that humble dwelling,"" he replied. ""And that morning brought to each a cheerful, resolute spirit, which bore them through all their daily toil"" ""I am a man of the world,"" he said, ""and I will not be ashamed to say that I am proud of my family."" ""I will never forget you,"" he added, ""even if it is a long way from home"" ""You will always be my friend,"" I said, and I meant it. ""I love you, my friend. I will always love you."". ""I spent last evening with the Wightmans,"" said I. ""They are not 'very poor,' for they take what the great Father sends, and use it with thankfulness"" ""Very poor,"" I said to myself, musingly, as I walked away from the humble abode of the Wightsmans. ""Verypoor. The words have had a wrong application."" ""I am beginning to feel rich"" ""I have not met a more cheerful family for years"" ""Those who ever want more than they possess are the very poor"" ""The last payment was made a month since. I am beginning the feel rich."" ""The word 'rich' is not a word I like to use,"" said Payson.. Payson looked at me a moment or two curiously, and then let his eyes fall to the ground. ""Ah! my friend, if I and mine were only contented and thankful!"" he said. ""But such are not the Wightmans,"" I replied, ""for we are poor--very poor"" And with these words on his lips, my old friend turned from me, and walked slowly away. Not long afterwards, I heard that he had failed. ""Now you are poor, very poor, indeed!"" I thought. ""And it was so"" I added. ""You have cause to be"" ""The great Father hath covered your table with blessings"" ""And yet we are neither contented nor thankful,"" said he, ""For"

""What constitutes them such? Not mere proximity, certainly. Because a person happens to live in a house near by, can that make him or her really a neighbor, and entitled to the attention and consideration due a neighbor?"" ""It ought not,"" she said, after sitting silent a little while, ""but still, it does."". ""Who is my neighbor? is a question of importance, and ought to be answered in every mind"" ""No matter what the character, we should be kind to all,"" said Mrs. Leland Halloran. ""I do not see how we can avoid calling upon them."". ""Should we not be kind to every one?"" ""Yes, kind; but not in the acceptation of the word as you have used it"" ""But the simple fact of my calling upon Mrs. Halloran cannot, possibly, give her the power of injuring me or any one else"" ""I do not, Jane."". ""I cannot, in the true sense of the word, consider her a neighbor,"" said the father. ""To show attentions, and give eminence and consideration to an evil-minded person, is to make evil, instead of good, the neighbor."". Mrs. Leland's mind perceived only in a small degree the force of what her husband said. Mrs. Halloran claimed her place from wealth and family connexions. It was not so much a regard for her new neighbor, as a desire to make her acquaintance. In a month the two families--that is, the female members of them--had become quite intimate.. Mr. Leland often urged his wife not to be too intimate with her new neighbor. ""Some evil, I am sure, will grow out of it,"" he would say, whenever allusion was in any way made to the subject of his wife's intimacy with. Jane Leland had become intimate with Mary Halloran, a bold-faced girl. Jane was eighteen, and before her acquaintance with Mary, had been but little into company. Her intimacy with Mary soon put new notions into her head. She began to think more of dress, and scarcely a day passed that she did not go out with her very intimate and pleasant friend.. Jane Halloran's mother, Mrs. Halloran, never fancied the daughter a great deal. She would have been much better satisfied if the two young ladies had not become quite so intimate. Mary Halloran goes and comes when she pleases.. Jane went out and called for Mary, and the two young ladies made a few calls, and then walked the streets until dinner time. They were accompanied by a dashing young fellow, who had been introduced to Mary a few evenings before, and now made bold to follow up the acquaintance, encouraged by a glance from the young. Jane Leland noticed that Mary Halloran was not to her taste. Mrs. Halloran's conversation involved topics neither interesting nor instructing. Mrs Leland felt her too frequently repeated visits as an annoyance. Mrs Halloran did not return more than one out of every half dozen calls she received.. ""I do wish she had never known her."" ""So do I, from my heart"" ""It will be a difficult matter to break it off now"" ""No matter how difficult it may be, it must be done"" ""I have ceased visiting Mrs. Halloran almost entirely"". ""Better offend her than suffer, as we are likely to suffer, from a continuance of the acquaintance,"" said Mr. Leland. ""I dislike her more and more every day,"" said Mrs. Halloran. ""Let her talk. What she says will be no scandal,"" returned Mr.Leland.. ""I wish it could be prevented. But I am afraid of harsh measures."" ""Our duty to our child requires us at once to break up all intercourse with the family"" ""I am more afraid of the consequences to our daughter"" ""We know not into what company this indiscreet young lady may introduce"". Mr. Leland happened to be sitting near the window and saw him. The young man who had come home with Jane bore a notoriously bad character. It was little less than disgrace, in the eyes of virtuous people, for a lady to be seen in the street with him. Mr. and Mrs. Lander mutually resolved that all intercourse with Mrs Leland. Jane Leland was engaged to Mary Halloran. Mrs. Halloran told her that she was never engaged to a neighbor. Jane's father demanded that the intimacy between Mrs. Leland and her daughter should cease. Jane was not prepared to sacrifice the friendship of Mary.. Jane Halloran's mother told her that her father was a bad man. She asked why she should be with him, and her mother replied that he was a friend of her father's. Jane's mother then said that her daughter had been introduced to bad company by her father.. Mary Halloran was engaged to be married. Her mother asked her to excuse her daughter, as she was engaged. Mary Halloran turned away, evidently offended. Jane's mother returned from a visit with Mary Halloran. She told Jane that her husband had asked Mary to marry him. Jane was greatly disturbed. She wrote a letter to Mary, explaining her position. Mary replied, in an epistle full of sympathy for her unhappy condition.. The letter contained various suggestions in regard to the manner in which Jane ought to conduct herself, none of them at all favorable to submission and concluded with warm attestations of friendship. Mary Halloran was seriously offended at the sudden repulse both she and her daughter had met, and spared no pains, and let no opportunity go unimproved, for saying hard things of Mrs. Leland.. Mrs. Leland felt it to be her duty, as a parent, to see this lady, and frankly ask the reason of her conduct towards Jane, as well as toward her and her husband. She felt called upon to do this, in order to ascertain if there were not some things injurious to her daughter in common report.. ""It is a delicate and painful subject for me to speak of to you, Mrs. Leland."" ""No matter. Put yourself in my place, and you will not long hesitate what to do."" ""There is one young man in this city whose very name should shock the ear of. ""I was urged by my husband not to call upon her when she moved in our square, but I felt it to be only right to visit her as a neighbor"" ""Mrs. Halloran is a woman of no principle. You have deeply offended her, and she takes this method of being revenged"". ""Mrs. Halloran is not to be regarded as a neighbor,"" replied the lady. ""I am afraid your daughter is misleading you in some things, and giving color to what is said of her"" ""Impossible!"" said Mrs. Leland. ""Imp impossible!"". Mrs. Leland found a note addressed to Jane lying upon her table. It was from Mary Halloran, and in these words: ""MY SWEET FRIEND,--I saw Mr. Clement last night at the opera. He had a great deal to say about you, and uttered many flattering compliments on your beauty"". Mr. and Mrs. Leland were deeply troubled by the note. They decided not to say anything to Jane about it. The note was written by Clement Leland, their new neighbor. Mr. Lelander was shocked to see Jane leave the house with a man. He ran to the house and found her in a carriage.. Mr. Leland knew the form of his daughter. Ere the young lady and her attendant could cross the pavement, he had confronted them. Angry beyond the power of control, he seized the arm of Jane with one hand, and, as he drew away from her companion, knocked him down with a tremendous blow from the cane.. Jane either was, or affected to be, unconscious, when she arrived at home. Two days after, this paragraph appeared in one of the daily papers. ""SAVED FROM THE BRINK OF RUIN"" ""We hope it will prove a lesson that she will never forget"" ""A young man of notoriously bad character, yet connected with one of our first families"". Clement's wife, Mary Halloran, was a willing victim too many believed, for she was not ignorant of Clement's real character. She understood, better than she had ever done before, the oft-repeated remark of"

For hours every fair day, during spring, summer, and autumn, he might be seen in front of the little. Many pitied the poor cripple; many looked upon him with feelings of disgust and repulsion; but few, if any, sought to do him good. ""If good works are the only passport to heaven,"" he said to a neighbor one day, ""I fear my chances will be small"". ""If that were so you would be in your grave. But God knows best. There is something for you to do,"" said the neighbor. ""A poor, helpless creature, burdening my wife. Better for me, and for all, if I were in my grave."". The sick man did not respond warmly to this proposition. He had been so long a mere recipient of good offices. Idle dependence had made him selfish. ""Give this poor cripple a lesson every day,"" went on the neighbor, pressing home the subject. Take him in charge as one of God's children, who needs to be instructed and led up to a higher life than the.

""Take him, then, and unlock the doors of a mind that now sits in darkness, that sunlight may come in,"" he replied.. Tom Croft taught himself the alphabet and learned to construct small words. He was so successful that he soon became a scholar. The neighbor who suggested this useful employment of the invalid's time, looked in now and then to see how matters were progressing.. Tom no longer made queer faces, or looked at them wickedly, as if he would harm them if in his power, nor retorted angrily if they said things to worry him. Soon the children, who had only looked at him, half in fear, from a distance, or come closer to the. Tom was a bedridden man who read for hours every day. The children in the neighborhood, who had grown to like him, supplied him with books. Tom had some of this qualities of a sponge: it absorbed a great deal, and, like a sponge, gave out freely at every pressure. He was always talking or always listening when he had anybody who would talk or listen to him.. Tom Hicks, a cripple, was a friend of the children of the village. The children's parents were surprised when they found their sons going to his house. They questioned him closely about the nature of their intercourse with him. The story of Tom's change of character was revealed to them by a neighbor of the sick man.. Tom Croft, a cripple, was sent to school by his bedridden instructor. Mr. Croft was praised for his generous conduct, and helped by many who had, until now, felt indifferent, towards his case. Tom's eagerness to learn, and rapid progress under the most limited advantages, became generally known.. ""I owe it all to you,"" he said, as he brought the white, thin hand of his benefactor to his lips. ""And our Father in heaven will reward you."". ""You have, with but little effort, lifted a human soul out of the dark valley of ignorance, where it was groping ill self-torture,"" said the neighbor. ""The light of hope has fallen, through your aid, with sunny warmth upon a heart that was cold and barren a little while ago,"" he added.. Tom Hicks was bedridden and could not write with his bent, stiff fingers. He kept on trying and trying, until he could write with a fair hand. The infinite years to come alone can reveal the blessings that will flow from this one act of a bedridden man, who felt that in him was no capacity for good deeds, said the author.. It was five years from the day he gave the poor cripple, Tom Hicks, his first lesson. Croft, the poor bedridden man. Life's pulses were running very low. The long struggle with disease was nearly over.. ""I owe it all to you,"" replied the cripple, in a voice that trembled with feeling. ""God will reward you."" ""I have heard the good news,"" he said, as he reached a hand feebly towards Tom, ""and it has made my heart glad."". ""My benefactor!"" sobbed the cripple, as he stood by the wasted form shrouded in grave-clothes, and looked upon it for the last time ere the coffin-lid closed over it. ""What would I have been except for you?"" Think! Cast around you. Is there no poor. You may never be able to act directly on society to any great purpose, in consequence of mental or physical disabilities. But you may, by instruction and guidance, prepare some other mind for useful work, which, but for your agency, might have wasted its powers in ignorance or crime.

0.39,0.49,35.25585429314831,"""Did you ever see such a queer looking figure?"" a woman asked her companion. She was riding along in an open carriage, a short distance from the city, accompanied by a relative. She had on a faded calico dress, short in the waist; stout leather shoes; the remains of what had once been a red merino long shawl.. The young girl's countenance was youthful, but plain almost to homeliness. The smallness of her eyes, which were close together and placed at the Mongolian angle, gave to her countenance a singular aspect. The young man gently drew on the rein of his horse so as still further to diminish his speed.. ""You look like a gentleman and a lady,"" said a man whom was riding by, and happened to overhear some of their last remarks. ""Your conduct is anything but gentlemanly and lady-like,"" he said. ""I would advise them to keep you in until you had sense and decency enough not to disgrace yourselves"". ""You will hear from me in good time,"" said the stranger. ""I'll teach him a lesson!"" said the elegant young man with contempt. ""How he frightened me!"" ejaculated the young lady as her rather crestfallen companion laid the whip upon his horse and dashed ahead.. The pair were thrown from a carriage in a secluded place. The young man received only a slight bruise, but the girl was more seriously injured. The pair were riding across the country in order to reach another avenue leading into the city, but missed his way and bewildered in a maze of winding country roads. They had been thoughtless, to say the least of it.. A young man saw a woman hit her head on a stone and was unable to move. He raised his voice and cried ""Help!"" The door of a cabin flung open and a woman and boy looked eagerly around. The young man recognized instantly in the woman the person they had so wantonly insulted only an hour or. The girl was taken to a house by a kind-hearted woman. She was very ill, and the man carried her to the house. The woman was a woman of the house, and was very kind. The man asked, eagerly, if there was a doctor near.. ""He has gone for the doctor; but will be back very soon,"" said the young woman, in a kind, soothing voice. ""If you will come to the door, I will show you the doctor's house,"" she said. ""I think he must be at home, for I saw him go by only a quarter of an hour since. The young girl's face was one of identification; and even amid the terror that oppressed her heart, the unwilling visitor felt a sense of painful mortification. With a frightened cry she fell backs upon the pillow from which she had risen. ""O, I am glad!"" she repeated. ""It might have been so much worse."". The young couple looked at each other with dismay pictured in their countenances. ""I wish it were in my power to make you more comfortable,"" said the kind-hearted girl. ""What we have is at your service in welcome, and all that it is in myPower to do shall be done for you cheerfully,"" replied the young man. The young woman became sick and faint, and remained so until the physician came.. The young man dazed upon her in wonder and shame--wonder at the charm that now appeared in her singularly marked countenance, and shame for the disgraceful and cowardly cruelty with which he had a little while before so wantonly assailed her. After seeing his unhappy relative in as comfortable a condition as possible, the young man, with the doctor's aid. The young girl was not really bad at heart; but false estimates of things, trifling associations, and a thoughtless disregard of others, had made her far less a lady in act than she imagined herself to be in quality. The delicacy of her attentions, and the absence of everything like a desire to refund her of the recent unpleasant incident, marked her as possessing, even if her face and attire were plain, and her position humble.. ""O, no, sir!"" she said, drawing back, while a glow came into her pale face, and made it almost beautiful; ""I have only done a simple duty."" ""Your reward is great,"" said the father, touched with the noble answer, ""may God bless you, my good girl!"" ""If you will not receive my money, accept my grateful thanks. The humbled girl grasped her hand tightly, and murmured, ""I shall never forget you--never!"" ""Get his forgiveness, and all will be right,"" she said. ""You have mine, and also the prayer of my heart that you may be good and wise, for only such are happy"" The incident of that day were a life-lesson that never passed entirely from their remembrance."

They agreed that they would own it in common, all five of them, and each was to sit on it in turn like a goose, and so hatch the gosling.. The Fjeld 043 is a collection of short stories by the Fjelder family. The story of a gosling who chipped an egg and said, ""Herrings and brose, porridge and milk, all at once"" The story was told to a group of five children..

The goodman felt he ought to keep a workman who was so strong.. Grumblegizzard was sent to the king's grange. He was to be odd man, and help the lasses to bring in wood and water, and other small jobs. He alone ate all that was ready for the master and mistress and for the servants, and after all he was not half full. He then fell to chopping and hewing till the splinters flew about him.. Grumblegizzard went off to the smithy, and got a smith to help him to make an axe of fifteen pounds of iron. He then went into the forest and began to clear it; down toppled tall spruces and firs fit for masts. 'Twas not long before he had chopped up all that there was, both of firewood and timber, both planks and. ""He has slain twelve men,"" said the king, ""and he eats for twelve times twelve"" ""He laid a good load on a sledge, and put all the horses to it, but they could not stir the load from the spot"" ""The house was so shaken that it gave way at every joist, and he was within an ace of dragging the whole grange over on end"". ""For how many do you work, I should like to know?"" said Grumblegizzard. ""For twelve times twelve too,"" said the king. ""Then go on and fight them,"" said his king. The king took his people with him to meet the foe. The battle was fought in the middle of a field.. The king wanted a mighty club to fight with. He forged a club of fifteen tons, and it took a hundred men to turn it on the anvil. He also made a scrip for food, and stuffed it full of ox-hides. The king then decided to kill the smith.. ""Bide a bit, till I have had my dinner,"" said Grumblegizzard, as he threw himself down on the road, and fell to eating behind his great scrip. And so he toddled off down the hill with his scrip at his back and his club on his shoulder. When he had got so far that the enemy saw him, they sent out a. Grumblegizzard set off from the grange, with his scrip on his back and his club on his shoulder. But just then he got a bombshell right down his throat. He spat it out again; and then came a chain-shot and made its way into his butter-box, and another took the bit he was just going to eat from between his fingers. Then he got angry, and rose up, and took his club,. The Grumblegizzard asked his mother to give him a land-tax. She said she had never in her born days heard talk of any land- tax. He lost no time on the way, but when he got there, Old Nick was gone to serve a jury.. ""That stood as fast as the old fir-tree,"" she said, ""that grew outside the gate of hell, and was so big that fifteen men could scarcely span it when they held hands"". ""When he heard that Grumblegizzard had stridden off from his house with his big scrip full of money, he first of all beat and banged his mother, and then ran after him"". ""Here you have the land-tax,"" said Grumblegizzard, as he came to the king's grange, and dashed down the scripful of money. The king thanked him, and put a good face on it, and promised him good pay and a safe pass home if he cared to have. The Troll was said to dwell who had taken the king's grandfather's sword. Grumblegizzard got several loads of food into his big scrip, and set off again. But the Troll was not to be seen under bare sky, and the hill was fast shut. So he joined fellowship with some quarrymen, who were living at a hill farm. ""I'm a pretty good trencherman myself,"" said Grumblegizzard. ""But whoever has been here, has a sharper tooth, for he has eaten up bones and all"". The Troll's old mother, asleep and snoring, hid the sword at the bottom of his bed. The king sent four horses to fetch the sword, but they could not stir it. The Troll's mother drank the sea dry, and so she burst. The sword stayed where it was, and the king could not move it an inch.. The king could not believe his eyes when he saw Grumblegizzard again. He promised him gold and green woods; and when GrumbleGizzard wanted more work, he said he had better set off for a haunted castle. The door blew back against the wall, and he saw nothing but a gaping jaw. Old Nick begged and prayed so prettily to be let go.. ""This is a hard bargain,"" said Old Nick. And so he too had to promise to build a bridge over the Sound, so that folks could pass over it at all times of the year. So he got loose, and went home; but Grumblegizzard lay down to sleep, and slept till far on next day. So when the king came to see if he was hacked to pieces or torn to bits, he had to wade through heaps of money before. Old Nick stood on the bridge to take the toll he had bargained for. Grumblegizzard wanted the king with him to try the bridge, but he had no mind to do that. So he got up himself on a horse, and threw the fat milkmaid from the king's grange upon the pommel before him.. us: ""You caught me once, and you shan't catch me again in a cleft stick;"" and with that he flew off straight home to his old mother. Since then he has never been seen or heard in those parts. ""If he hasn't come down again, there he is still hanging with his scrip between heaven and earth, to this very day"""

He had written home for a horse and sledge and his father's fur coat, but his letter could scarcely reach our valley before the day after Christmas. His comrades had all left town, and he knew no family with whom he could make himself at home during the holidays. He wrote to his parents, but they were too far away, and the horse could not be in town before New Year's Eve. The author's letter to them could not reach them before the end of the year, and they could not afford to send him back.. The two old maids I lodged with were certainly very kind and friendly people, and they had taken great care of me in the commencement of my illness. But the peculiar ways and habits of these ladies were too much of the old school to prove attractive to the fancies of youth. Their thoughts dwelt mostly on the past; and when they, as often might occur, related to me some stories of the town, its people and its customs, these stories reminded me, not only by their contents, but also by the simple, unaffected way in which they were rendered, of a past age. It was one of those old houses in Custom House Street, with deep windows, long dark passages and staircases, gloomy rooms and garrets.. ""I tried to divert myself in my loneliness and melancholy mood by looking out at all the people who passed up and down the street,"" he writes. ""The only relief to this kind of life was a pretty niece and some merry little cousins of hers, who always made me tell them fairy tales and stories"" ""The Swan,"" as it is still called, stood there, with its dark, reddish-brown walls, its pointed gables and towers, with weather-cocks and latticed windows,"" he says. ""It was growing dusk. I could not distinguish the countenances any longer, but gazed across at the old building,"" he adds.. The Swan looked then, as now, a most respectable and sedate bird, with its gold ring round its neck, its spur-boots, and its wings stretched out as if to fly. I was about to plunge myself into reflection on imprisoned birds when I was disturbed by noise and laughter proceeding from some children in the adjoining room. ""Will you not come in to us now at once? Old Mother Skau and my brother's little girls have come; they will perhaps amuse you a little. You are so fond of the dear children."". The room was furnished in the old style, with high-back, Russia leather chairs, and one of those settees which were intended for farthingales and straight up-and-down. The walls were adorned with oil paintings, portraits of stiff ladies with powdered coiffures, of bewigged Oldenborgians, and other redoubtable persons in mail and armour or red coats. The children do so like to tumble about here before the fire in the dusk of the evening, and Madam Skau does also enjoy a quiet little chat in the chimney corner,"" said Miss Cicely. ""Oh, chat me here and chat me there! there is nothing you like yourself better than a little bit of gossip,"" said the old asthmatic lady.. ""Come and sit down here and tell me how it fares with you,"" she said. ""By my troth, you are nothing but skin and bones!"" ""I won't go; I am afraid of the brownies!"" ""Never mind, my dear, Stine says it only to get rid of you,"" said Miss Mette. ""She dare not go into the hay-loft herself—the foolish old thing—in the dark, for she knows well enough she was frightened once by the brownie herself,"" said the aunt.. ""Oh, is that you, Lieutenant? I did not know you. How pale you are! It is such a long time since I saw you!"" shouted the children all at once, as they flocked round me. ""But are you not going to say good evening to the Lieutenant, children?"" they asked. ""Now you must tell us something awfully jolly!"" they demanded. ""Do tell us about Buttercup and Goldentooth!"" I had to tell them about the brownies at Vager and at Bure, who stole hay from each other, and who met at last with a load of hay on their backs.. ""It served him right, the naughty brownie!"" they shouted, and asked for another story. ""Well,"" said I, ""I will tell you the story of Peter Gynt and the trolls. The children clapped their hands in great joy and laughed heartily. ""In the olden days there lived in Kvam a hunter whose name was Peter Gyn. He was always roaming about in the mountains after bears and elks. He had heard of a farm on Doorefell which was invaded by such a number of trolls every Christmas Eve that the people on the farm had to move out, and get shelter at their neighbours'. ""Peter thought he should be able to clear the trolls out,"" says the author. ""He had done such a thing before; and then he got leave to stay, and a pig's skin into the bargain"" The trolls had a fiddler with them, and some began dancing, while others fell to eating the Christmas fare on the table. During this some of the trolls found the shoe Peter had made and began eating it. ""Peter took out his awl and pitch and twine, and began making a big, big shoe, which it took the whole Pig's skin to make. He put a strong rope in for lacings, that he might pull the shoe tightly together, and. ""The bear put his nose out from behind the fireplace, where he was lying, and smelt they were frying something. They thought it must belong to a very big foot. They all wanted to try it on at once, so they put a foot each into it"" ""Peter made haste and tightened the rope, took one of the handspikes and fastened the rope around it, and got them at last securely tied up in the shoe"" ""The trolls had to clear out at last, but Peter stayed and enjoyed himself with all the Christmas fare the whole week"". ""Some years afterwards, about Christmas time, Peter was out in the forest cutting wood for the holidays, when a troll came up to him and shouted 'Have you got that big pussy of yours, yet?' After that the trolls were not heard of there for many years. ""Aunt Mette will tell you a story now,"" said Miss Cicely. ""I don't know exactly what I shall tell you,"" said Aunt Mette, ""but since we have commenced telling about the brownies, I think I will tellYou something about them. ""Oh, yes, yes!"" shouted the children. ""You remember, of course, old Kari Gausdal, who came here and baked bread, and who always had so many tales to tell you"" ""Well, old. Kari told me that she was in service at the orphan asylum some years ago, and at. Kari was a servant at a house in the country. The other servants warned her not to light a fire before two o'clock. She did it anyway. The fire went out in a moment. Somebody appeared to be throwing the logs about on the hearth, but she could not see who it was. Kari was anything but chicken-hearted. If he comes in my way, why, by my faith, I will send him head over heels through the door. She said. 'I have nothing to do with that brownie of yours, but if he comes into my way I will kill him'. ""I am getting so frightened!"" said one of the children. ""No, you must tell us some more stories, Lieutenant,"" said another. ""I never feel afraid when you tell us anything,"" said the third. ""You tell us such jolly tales,"" replied the fourth. ""And so I did,"" said Kari Gausdal, ""and the children went on to tell their own stories."" ""And from that time nobody saw or heard the brownie in the asylum,"" said Gausdale. ""But from that point on, the children never heard of him again."". ""There was, once upon a time,"" says the author, ""a lassie who was sent up into the hay-loft with the cream porridge for the brownie"" The story was told to the children by the author's niece, Lizzie, who was besieged by the children and had to promise to do the singing. The children asked the author to tell them a story about the Halling dance. The author said he was going to sing it, but the children wouldn't let him off.. She ate the porridge herself, and the melted butter in the bargain, and went up into the hay-loft with the plain oatmeal porridge and sour milk, in a pig's trough instead. 'There, that's good enough for you, Master Brownie,' she said. But no sooner had she spoken the words than the brownie stood right before her, seized her. The children were soon quiet, and Mother Skau commenced as follows: ""You hear a great deal about brownies and fairies and such like beings, but I don't believe there is much in it. I have neither seen one nor the other. But old Stine out in the kitchen there, she says she has seen the brownie"" The children romped about the room in uproarious joy. But as long as they danced, the ""brownie sang,"" said Cousin Lizzie, ""to the tune of the Halling."" The children then began to sing. The story ended with the children singing to the tune, and the children dancing.. People said there was a brownie in the house. Well, it so happened that Stine and the cook were sitting in their room one evening, mending and darning their things. They heard a terrible crash down stairs in the kitchen, and Stine shouted, 'Lor' bless and preserve us! it must be the brownie' When they opened the kitchen door they found all the crockery on the floor, but none of it broken. The brownie was standing on the big kitchen table with his red cap on, and hurling one dish after the other on to the floor. He was laughing in great glee. Stine was so frightened she dared scarcely move a foot.. The cook had heard that the brownies could sometimes be tricked into moving into another house when anybody would tell them of a very quiet place. She took courage and spoke to him and told him he ought to remove to the tinman's over the way, where it was so very quiet and pleasant. He seemed to feel quite at home there, although they were hammering and tapping away there all day. But people said that the gude-wife put a dish of porridge up in the garret for him every Thursday evening, and it's no wonder they got on well and became rich when they had a brownie in the house. Stine believed he brought things to them.. ""My mother, who, by the way, was a truthful woman, told a story which happened here in the town one Christmas Eve,"" said Mother Skau. ""Let us hear it, Madame Skau,"" said I. ""Yes, tell, tell,"" cried the children. ""When my mother still was in her teens, she used sometimes to visit a widow whom she knew, and whose name was Madame Evensen,"" she said. ""Whether it was the brownie or not who really helped them, I cannot say,"" she added. ""I know it is true, for an untrue word never passed her lips,"" replied I.. A woman thought she would go to the morning service on the Christmas Day. She left out some coffee with the girl before she went to bed, that she might get a cup next morning. When she woke, the moon was shining into the room, but the clock had stopped. She took her hymn-book and started for church. But when she went inside, she thought that the people were so pale and so strange. They looked exactly as if they were all dead. She must have overslept herself! She called the girl and told her to get the coffee ready, while she dressed herself. The street was very quiet; she did not meet a single person on her way to church. She sat down in her customary seat in one of the pews.. She did not know any of them, but there were several of them she seemed to recollect having seen before. When the minister came into the pulpit, she saw that he was not one of the ministers in the town, but a tall, pale man. He preached very nicely indeed, and there was not the usual noisy coughing and hawking which you always hear at the morning services on a Christmas Day. It was so quiet, you could have heard a needle drop on the floor. She began to feel quite uneasy and uncomfortable. A female who sat next to her leant towards her and whispered in her ear, 'Throw the cloak loosely around you and go, because if you wait here till the service is over. ""She got away from them safe enough; only listen! When the widow heard the voice of the person next to her, she turned round to look at her,"" says the author. ""She recognized her; it was her neighbour who died many years ago,"" he says. ""When she came out on the steps, she felt that they had got hold of her cloak,"" he adds. ""So she let it go and left it in their clutches, while she hurried home as quickly as she could"" The next day the people found the cloak lying on the Steps, but it was torn into a thousand pieces. ""By the time she got inside she was nearly half dead,"" says author. 'She was that frightened.. The children, who had expressed considerable fear and uneasiness during the latter part of the story, declared they would not hear any more such terrible stories. The lights, the Christmas cake, the jellies, the tarts and the wine soon chased away the horrible ghost story and all fear from their minds. Finally, our thoughts took a flight towards something more substantial, on the appearance of the Christmas porridge and the roast ribs of pork. The children had crept up into the sofa and on the chairs, but still they thought they felt somebody plucking at them from underneath the table. Suddenly the lights were brought in, and we discovered then, to our great amusement, that the children had put their legs on to the table, and were playing.. The author and his wife had a very uneasy night, and broke up early. He says he got mixed up with fairies, fairies and ghosts the whole night. The minister was in the pulpit; it was my grandfather, who died when I was a little boy. He made a somersault right into the middle of the church, and the surplice flew one way and the collar another. The church was lighted up, and when I came inside I saw it was our own church up in the valley. There were nobody there but peasants in their red caps, soldiers in full uniform.. The parson was in the midst of a wild dance. A big tall peasant came towards me and took me by the shoulder and said, ""You'll have to join us, my lad!"" The parson awoke and could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw the same peasant whom he had seen in my dream leaning over him. There he was, with the red cap down over his ears, a big fur coat over his arm, and a pair of big eyes looking fixedly at me. ""There lies the parson, and here am I,"" he said, with one of his well-known airs.. ""But, good heavens! is that you, Thor?"" I shouted in great joy. It was indeed my father's man, a splendid specimen of a Norwegian peasant. ""I came with your favourite, the bay mare. I had to take your father down to Næs, and then he says to me, 'Thor,' says he, 'it isn't very far to town from here' Just take the baymare and run down and see how the Lieutenant is, and if he is well and can come back with you, you must bring him back along with. The End. The End. ""Such a Christmas as I spent that year I cannot recollect before or since. Such a Christmas"" ""The End"" is a novel about a family holiday in the South"

He meditates, then falls into a doze. The day wanes. The earth is deserted; no other man breathes the air of life. I am the last; I can die. God may pardon me if He wishes, but death will console me. That mountain is as unyielding as my grief; those eagles that fly yonder must be as famished as my despair. Shall you, too, die, divine eagles? The eternal wanderer will. The last of men, all the common spirits will perish forever. The flower of them it is which will return to earth and rule. Life, like ancient Thebes, has a hundred gates. You close one, and others will open. You are the last of your species? Then another better species will come, made not of clay, but of the light itself. The ages will be rectified. The age will be reversed. The earth is bare of them. Of a surety the race of man is perished; the earth is full of them, and the world is empty.. ""What can all this posthumous joy matter to the species that dies with me? What you tell me is even better than what Campanella dreamed,"" he asks. ""Let me go and die. May the Lord hear you! But let me go, and die!"" ""Evil will end; the winds will thenceforth scatter neither the germs of death nor the clamor of the oppressed,"" he says. ""Only the song of love everlasting and the benediction of universal justice will scatter evil"" ""Go, go, go. But why this haste to end your days? The haste of a man who has lived for thousands of years"". Ahasverus was in Jerusalem at the time they were about to crucify Christ. When he passed my door he weakened under the burden of the beam that he carried on his shoulders. I thrust him onward, admonishing him not to stop, not to rest, to continue on his way to the hill where he was to be crucified. Then there came a voice from heaven, telling me that I, too, should have to journey forever, continuously, until the end of time. Such was my crime; I felt no pity for him who was going to his death. How many times have I seen the same thing since, traveling unceasingly through cities and ages!. ""What does one chapter know of the other chapter? Nothing. But he who has read them all, connects them and concludes"" ""Are there melancholy pages? There are merry and happy ones, too. Tragic convulsion precedes that of laughter"" ""Life burgeons from death; swans and swallows change climate, without ever abandoning it entirely"" ""You have beheld this, not ten times, not a thousand times, but ever"" ""What do you know of my life? Nothing; you are ignorant of human existence"" ""How laughable! Come, perpetual man, explain yourself. Tell me everything"". ""I journeyed everywhere, whatever the race, the creed, the tongue; suns and snows, barbarous and civilized peoples, islands, continents; wherever a man breathed, there breathed I"" ""I never labored. Labor is a refuge, and that refuge was denied me. Every morning I found upon me the necessary money for the day ... See; this is the last apportionment. Go, for I need you no longer"" ""Happy are those who read only one chapter of life,"" he says. ""I saw them in changing aspect. You spoke of a chapter?"" ""Yes,"" he replies.. Prometheus. My name is Prometheus. But you did not suffer, I believe. It is something not to suffer. Yes, but I saw other men suffer, and in the end the spectacle of joy gave me the same sensations as the discourses of an idiot. Fatalities of flesh and blood, unending strife. I saw all pass before my eyes, until night caused me to lose my taste for day, and now I cannot distinguish flowers from thistles. Everything is confused in my wearied retina. I am Prometheus. I have suffered the wrath of the gods.. Prometheus was condemned to the most cruel of tortures by Jupiter. Two emissaries from heaven came to secure him to the rock, and an eagle kept gnawing at his liver without ever consuming it. The chains were wrought by a divine hand. Vulcan forged them. An eagle like that which now is flying across the horizon, kept gnawed at my liver. This lasted for time beyond my reckoning. No, no, you cannot imagine this torture .... You! Prometheus! You are telling me a tale. I know that Hellenic myth.. ""You are Prometheus, creator of the first men?"" he asks. ""Are you not deceiving me? You, Prometheus? Was that not, then, a figment of the ancient imagination?"" ""Yes, it was your crime,"" he replies. ""That was my crime. ... And humanity wept far more because of your crime"" ""You, who gave me life, perverse divinity, were the cause of all,"" he says. ""I wept them for your humankind"". Hercules was bound again by the god of the underworld. The god said he would write the epitaph of a world on a stone before he died. He said: 'I represent the power of millennial despairs. All humanity is concentrated within me' The god then said he was going to summon an eagle to give him a god as a gift. He then said that Hercules would not be able to break the chains. The gods then said: ""You are raving. You are ranting"" and released Hercules. The last words of the book were: 'Hercule, Hercules, Hercules'. Prometheus. The truth unknown to man is the madness of him who proclaims it. Glory pays nothing, and dies. Kneel, and let me manacle your arms. Bend this way; now your legs. Have done, have done. It is the passions of earth turning upon me. You will not be spared a jot of your destiny; it will be fulfilled to the letter. You yourself will be the new Hercules. I, who announced the glory of the other, now proclaim yours; and you will be no less generous than he.. A new race shall people the earth, formed of the chosen spirits of the extinct humanity; the multitude of others will perish. A noble family, all-seeing and powerful, will be the perfect synthesis of the divine and the human. The ephemeral world cannot understand the world eternal; but you will be a link between the two. The despised of men shall rule over mankind. The Wanderer will find rest. You yourself, you, the chosen one, will become the King. You shall be King. Yes, Ahasverus.. The new world needs to be bound by a tradition, and none can speak of one to the other as you can. The perfect will proceed from the imperfect, and your lips will tell the new world its origin. You will relate to the new humanity all the ancient good and evil. And thus will you live anew like the tree whose dead branches are lopped off, only the flourishing ones being preserved, but here growth will be eternal. Just was the punishment; but equally just is the glorious remission of my sin. Shall I live? I myself? A new and better life? No, you are jesting with me. Very well, then; leave me.. Prometheus. The selfsame sun that is about to set. The description of life is not worth the sensation of life; you shall experience it deeply. The bosom of Abraham in your old Scriptures is nothing but this final, perfect world. There you will greet David and the prophets. There will be concentrated all that is best in nature, energizing or subtle, scintillating or pure. Swear that you are not lying. You will see whether I lie.. ""I shall gaze ever on the immense blue sky?"" he asks. ""I shall behold you forever,"" he says. ""Tell me everything. Tell me everything"" ""There will you tell to the astounded listeners, not only the great events of the extinct world, but also the ills they will never know,"" he adds. ""The soul, like the earth, will possess an incorruptible tunic"" ""Such is your destiny; neither you nor I can alter it,"" he writes.. He is dying, yet he dreams of life. He is the chosen king of a chosen people. Where one life heaped mire, another life will place a halo. The two eagles draw near. He continues to dream. The Lord said unto him: ""Thou hast seen with thine eyes, yet shalt not pass beyond"" You shall pass beyond, Ahasverus; you shall dwell in Jericho. He says: ""Let me breathe a little of the new, full life ... King, did you say? King, what do you say?"""

There is plenty of paper, indeed, but my courage is at low ebb, and as to the time that is yet left me, it may be compared to the life of a candle-flame. So goodbye, my dear sir; read this and bear me no ill will"". The writer was an attendant to an invalid colonel in Rio de Janeiro. He was tired of copying Latin quotations and ecclesiastic formulas. He asked the vicar of a small town in the interior for an attendant. The priest proposed that he take the place, and he accepted it eagerly. He then went to Rio to take leave of a brother who lived at the capital, and from there he departed for the little village of the interior. When he arrived there he heard bad news concerning the colonel.. ""I found him on the veranda of his house, stretched out on a chair and suffering greatly"" ""He had used more attendants than medicines. In fact he had broken the faces of two of them"" ""I had no fear of persons in good health, still less of invalids"" ""And you, are you a thief?"" ""No, I'm not."" ""I'm a man of charity and forbearance."" ""And I'm a doctor."" ""No. I'm an inspector."". ""Your name is Colombo?"" he asked. ""No, sir. My name is Procopio José Gomes Vallongo."" He came to the conclusion that this was no Christian name. The next day he told the vicar so, adding that he had never had a more sympathetic attendant. The fact is, we lived a regular honeymoon that lasted one week. From the dawn of the eighth day I knew the life of my predecessors—a dog's life.. ""I am nearing the end, Procopio,"" he said to me that evening. ""I can't live much longer. I am upon the verge of the grave"" ""He took pleasure in the grief and the humiliation of others,"" says the author. ""He was nearly sixty, and since he had been five years old had been accustomed to having everybody at his beck and call"" ""That he was surly one could well forgive; but he was also very malicious,"" writes the writer. ""That was the last straw"". ""Do you believe in souls of the other world, Procopio?"" he asked. ""Nonsense!"" he replied passionately. ""Under no circumstances will I excuse you. You shall go, you shall pray over my tomb"" ""My ghost will come at night and pull you by the legs,"" he added, laughing. ""I was an ignoramus, a camel, a bumpkin, an idiot, a loggerhead—I was everything!"". ""I was in a hurry to get back to Rio de Janeiro. The colonel was rapidly getting worse. He made his will, the notary receiving almost as many insults as did I"" ""Having spent nothing of my wages, I was itching to dissipate them at the capital"" ""Very probably my chance was approaching. I yearned toget back to Janeiro at the first opportunity"" ""I was always present to receive his dictionary of insults"" ""The vicar would exhort me not to abandon the colonel I always yielded"". The colonel's treatment became more strict. Within me there seethed a cauldron of aversion and hatred. The vicar promised to find a substitute for me. On the evening of the 24th of August the colonel had a violent attack of anger. He struck me, he called me the vilest names, he threatened to shoot me. Finally he threw in my face a plate of porridge that was too cold for him. The plate struck the wall and broke into a thousand fragments.. The colonel was suffering from an aneurism. I was to wake him at midnight to give him his medicine. While he slept I took a book out of my pocket, a translation of an old d'Arlincourt romance which I had found lying about. I began to read it in his room, at a small distance from his bed. But, whether it was due to fatigue or to the influence of the book, I, too, fell asleep. The cries of the colonel awoke me with a start; in an instant I was up. With a leap I rushed upon the invalid; I. ""I went into the adjoining room, and for two hours I did not dare to return. It was intense stupefaction, a kind of vague and vacant delirium"" ""I swear to you that I heard distinctly voices that were crying at me: ""Murderer; Murderer!"" ""I was ready to let myself be struck ten, twenty, a hundred times, by the colonel's hand"" ""All was quiet in the house. The tick-tick of the clock, very even, slow, dryly metrical"". ""Cursed be the hour in which I ever accepted such a position,"" I cried. I began to pace the room aimlessly; I sat down, I brought my hands despairingly to my head; I repented ever having come to the place"" ""I believe it was only then that I thought clearly about the penalty of my crime. I saw myself already being accused and threatened with dire punishment,"" he said. ""From this moment fear complicated my feeling of remorse,"" he added. ""I flamed with resentment against the priest of Nichteroy, against the doctor, the vicar—. ""I felt my hair stand on end. A few minutes later I saw three or four human shapes spying at me from the terrace, where they seemed to be waiting in ambush,"" writes Cain. ""I discovered on the neck the neck marks of my nails,"" he adds. ""It was on the contrary very important for me to hide all traces of it"" ""I looked at the corpse, with its widely distended eyes and its mouth gaping, as if uttering the eternal reproach of the centuries,"" he writes.. The first idea that came to me was to leave as soon as possible under the pretext that my brother was ill. But I considered that my immediate departure might arouse suspicion, and I decided to wait. I laid out the corpse myself, with the assistance of an old, near-sighted negro. I remained continually in the room of the dead. I wanted to assure myself that no mistrust could be read upon the faces of the others.. ""Poor Procopio! Despite what he has suffered from his master, he is strongly moved"" ""I was anxious to have it all over with. We went out. Once in the street the passing from semi-obscurity to daylight dazed me and I staggered."" ""I never smiled; I scarcely spoke; I ate very little; I suffered hallucinations and nightmares"" ""Let the dead rest in peace,"" they would say to me"" ""It sounded like irony to me."". ""I had a mass sung for the eternal rest of the colonel at the Church of the Blessed Sacrament,"" he writes. ""I knelt during the whole service and made many signs of the cross"" ""I paid the priest double and distributed alms at the door, all in the name of the deceased,"" he says. ""It is out of all reason to show so much melancholy."" ""I wished to deceive nobody,"" he adds.. ""I never mentioned the colonel without repeating, ""May his soul rest in peace!"" I told several funny anecdotes about him, some amusing caprices of his ... I never mentioned him without saying, ""He died a happy man"" ""I reread the letter five times, ten times, a hundred times; it was true,"" he says. ""I was sure that I had read wrongly,"" he adds. ""It was there in black and white, I was really the sole heir of the colonel. ""How much was he worth?"" my brother asked me. ""I don't know, but I know that he was very wealthy."" ""He certainly was—he was....""Thus, by a strange irony of fate, all the colonel's wealth came into my hands"" ""I would accept the inheritance and would distribute it in small sums, secretly"" ""It seemed the only way to recover my peace of mind and feel that accounts were straight"". ""I evoked in my imagination his cries, his struggles, his looks on that horrible night of the crime,"" says the author. ""It was not the colonel's fault, that I knew well; it was his affliction that made him so peevish and even wicked"" ""I pardoned all, everything!... The worst of it was the end of that fatal night,"" he adds.. ""His days were numbered; did not he himself feel that? Didn't he say every now and then, ""How much longer have I to live? Two weeks, or one, perhaps less?"" ""This was not life, it was slow agony, if one may so name the continual martyrdom of that poor man,"" he wrote. ""Who knows, who can say that the struggle and his death were not simply a coincidence?"" ""I was astounded. Everybody praised my conduct. Such patience, such devotion,"" he said.. The priest defended the memory of the colonel. He recalled his good qualities, his virtues; had he not been austere? ""Austere!"" they would interrupt. ""Nonsense! He is dead, and it's all over now. But he was a regular demon!"" he said. ""A queer pleasure penetrated my heart, a pleasure from which,. ""Somewhat! Why he was as furious as a snake!"" exclaimed the barber. And I continued to defend the colonel; I explained him, I attributed much of the fault-finding to local animosity. And they would start to relate other anecdotes. They reviewed the entire life of the deceased. The old folks took particular delight in recalling the cruelties of his youth.. The colonel's legacy was converted into land-titles and cash. The money was given to the poor, the church, the Sacred House of Mercy, etc. He also erected a simple marble monument on his grave. The monument was the work of a Neapolitan sculptor who remained at Rio until 1866, and who has since died, I believe, in Paraguay. The doctor's doctors were unanimous as regards the inevitable end in store for the invalid, and were indeed surprised that he should so long have resisted.. ""Blessed are they who possess, for they shall be consoled,"" he said. ""Good-bye, my dear sir. If you deem these notes not totally devoid of value reward me for them with a marble"
0.65,0.75,53.205465055176035,"Rita tells Camillo that she went to a fortune-teller because she was afraid he would forget her. Camillo laughs at her and says, ""That's just like you men; you don't believe in anything"" Rita says she was wrong. Hamlet observes to Horatio that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy. This was the selfsame explanation that was given by beautiful Rita to her lover, Camillo, on a certain Friday of November, 1869, when Camillo laughed at her for having gone, the previous evening, to consult afortune-tellers.. Camillo seized her hands and gazed into her eyes earnestly and long. He swore that he loved her ever so much, that her fears were childish. Then he reproved her, saying that it was imprudent to visit such houses. Villela might learn of it, and then ... ""Impossible! I was exceedingly careful when I entered the place."" She translated Hamlet into every-day speech. If he was skeptical, let him have patience. One thing, however, was certain: the card reader had guessed everything.. The author, who had been superstitious as a child, decided to give up his religion. He said: 'I express myself ill, for to deny is in a sense to affirm, and he did not formulate his unbelief' The author then went on to write a book about his life and the life of his wife, who died in a car crash. The book, The Death and Life of Jesus Christ, was published in 1858. The author was inspired by the story of Jesus' birth and the birth of his son, Jesus Christ. He wrote: 'He was born a Christian, but he was not a believer. He. Villela, Camillo and Rita: three names, one adventure and no explanation of how it all began. The first two were friends since earliest childhood. Villela had entered the magistracy. Camillo found employment with the government, against the will of his father, who desired him to embrace the medical profession. But his father had died, and Camillo preferred to be nothing at all, until his mother had procured him a departmental position. The third was a woman that came from Rita's province. Rita was sure that she was loved; but Camillo was not only sure that he loved him,. Villela returned from the interior, where he had married a silly beauty. Camillo had secured a house for him near Botafogo and had welcomed him home. Rita was a trifle older than both the men: she was thirty, Villela twenty-nine and Camillo twenty-six. Propinquity bred intimacy. The three became closely bound. They were true friends. They had a special bond of friendship. They shared a love for each other. They knew each other well. They loved each other very much. They became very close.. Camillo's mother died, and in this catastrophe, for such it was, the other two showed themselves to be genuine friends of his. Villela took charge of the interment, of the church services and the settlement of the affairs of the deceased. Rita dispensed consolation, and none could do it better. They read the same books, they went together to the theatre or for walks. He taught her cards and chess, and they played of nights;—she badly,—he, to make himself agreeable, but little less badly. And now came personal intimacies, the timorous eyes of Rita, that so often sought his own, consulting them before they questioned his own husband.. Camillo was overcome with emotion when he received a note from Rita. He could not tear his eyes away from the missive. The old chaise in which for the first time you rode with your beloved, snuggled together, is as good as the chariot of Apollo. Such is man, and such are the circumstances that surround him. Camillo sincerely wished to flee the situation, but it was already beyond his power. He was helpless, overcome. Vexation, fear, remorse, desire,—all this he felt, in a strange confusion.. Camillo's confidence in his wife and his esteem for his friend continued the same as before. One day, however, Camillo received an anonymous letter, which called him immoral and perfidious. Camillo took fright, and, in order to ward off suspicion, began to make his visits to Villela's house more rare. The latter asked him the reason for his prolonged absence, and Camillo answered that the cause was a youthful flirtation. Simplicity evolved into cunning.. Camillo's wife, Rita, ran to the fortune-teller to consult her upon the real reason for Camillo's actions. Rita concurred, formulating, in ill-composed words of her own, this thought: virtue is indolent and niggardly, wasting neither time nor paper. Only self-interest is alert and prodigal. Camillo feared lest the anonymous writer should inform Villela, in which case the catastrophe would follow fast and implacably. The card reader restored the wife's confidence and the young man reproved her.. Camillo asked Villela to give him the envelopes in which the letters came, so that he could compare the handwriting with that of the mail which comes to him. If any arrives with writing resembling the anonymous script, I'll keep it and tear it up. But no such letter appeared. A short time after this, however, Villelas began to grow grave, speaking very little, as if something weighed upon his mind. Camillo disagreed; to appear after so many months was to confirm the suspicions and denunciations of the anonymous letters. They arranged means for communicating with each other in case of necessity and separated, in tears.. ""Come immediately to our house; I must talk to you without delay,"" he repeated, his eyes staring at the note. Camillo left at once; as he reached the street it occurred to him that it would have been much more natural for Villela to have called him to his office; why to his house? All this betokened a very urgent matter, whether it was reality or illusion, it seemed to Camillo that the letter was written in a trembling hand. He sought to establish a connection between all these things and the news Rita had brought him the night before. But he found nothing, nobody, nobody.. Camillo walked hastily along, agitated, nervous. He did not read the letter again, but the words hovered persistently before his eyes. He returned to the street, and the thought that they had been discovered grew every moment more convincing. ""Come immediately to our house; I must talk to you without delay."" Spoken thus by the voice of the other they seemed pregnant with mystery and menace. Come immediately,—why? It was now nearly one o'clock. So clearly did he imagine what was about to take place that he began to believe it a reality, to see it before his very eyes. Yes, without a doubt, he was afraid.. Camillo was on his way to visit a fortune teller when he was stopped by a coach. He decided to wait for the coach to pass. After five minutes he noticed that the fortune-teller's house was closed. Camillo decided to go to the square and take a tilbury. He arrived and ordered the driver to be off at full speed. He was soon face to face with danger. Never, as at this moment, had he so desired to believe in card-reading. He went to see the fortune tellers and found them all closed. They were all busy with people.. Camillo's excitement was intense, extraordinary, and from the deep, hidden recesses of his mind there began to emerge spectres of early childhood, old beliefs, banished superstitions. The fortune-teller seemed to be hovering over him, far, far above, with vast, ash-colored wings. In the street men were shouting, dragging away the coach. The coachman proposed another route; he shook his head and said that he would wait. He leaned forward to get a better look at the card-reader's house.. Camillo's wife's husband sent him a letter with the words: ""Come immediately ..."" Camillo thought rapidly of the inexplicability of so many things. The voice of his mother was repeating to him a host of extraordinary happenings. The very sentence of the Prince of Denmark kept echoing within him: ""There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in our philosophy"" What could he lose by it, if...? He jumped out to the pavement, just before the fortune-teller's door; he told the driver to wait for him, and hastened into the entry, ascending the stairs.. Camillo knocked on the door of the card-reader's house. She told him to go up to the attic. He entered and was met by a woman of forty, Italian, thin and swarthy. She opened a drawer and took out a pack of worn, filthy cards. While she rapidly shuffled them she peered at him closely, not so much with a direct gaze as from under her eyes. Camillo said that he had come to consult her, and she bade him enter. Thence they climbed to a staircase even worse than the first. At the top there was a garret, ill lighted by a small window. Old furniture, somber walls, and an air of poverty. Camillo, astonished, nodded affirmatively. The fortune-teller did not smile; she simply told him to wait. She took the cards hastily once more and shuffled them with her long tapering fingers whose nails were so long and unclean from neglect. Then she began to lay them out. Camillo's eyes were riveted upon her in anxious curiosity. She spoke to him of the love that bound them, of Rita's beauty. She told him nothing would happen to him or to the other. He was aware of nought. Nevertheless, great caution was indispensable; envy and rivalry were at work.. Camillo was bewildered. The fortune-teller stopped talking, gathered the cards and locked them in the drawer. Camillo, anxious to leave, was at a loss how much to pay; he did not know her fee. The woman went to the bureau, upon which lay a plate of raisins, took a cluster of them and commenced to eat them, showing two rows of teeth that were as white as her nails were black. Even in this common action the woman possessed an air all her own. ""Go, ragazzo. Camillo took out a note for ten milreis'[5] and gave it to the card-reader. Her usual fee was two million euros. ""How much do you want to send for?"" she asked. ""Ask your heart,"" she replied. ""I can see easily that the gentleman loves his lady very much ... And well he may. For she loves the gentleman very deeply, too"" The fortune-teller had already placed the note in her pocket, and accompanied him down the stairs, chatting gaily.. Camillo was on his way to Villela's house when he received the letter. He thought it was urgent and that he had done ill to delay so long. He even contemplated taking advantage of this incident to re-establish his former intimacy in Ville La's household. Together with his plans there kept echoing in his soul the words of the fortune-teller. Camillo's story is told in the novel ""The Adventures of Camillo"" by Camillo and his son, who was born in 17th century Italy.. ""The unknown present is the same as the future. And thus, slowly and persistently the young man's childhood superstitions attained the upper hand and mystery clutched him in its iron claws"" ""The truth is that his heart was happy and impatient, recalling the happy hours of the past and anticipating those yet to come. But the woman, the cards, her dry, reassuring words, and her good-bye"" ""Such were the new elements which, together with the old, formed within him a new and abiding faith"". Camillo was shot dead by Villela in his home in Brazil. The victim was Camillo's lover, Rita. Villella shot Camillo dead with two bullets. Camillo survived the attack. He later wrote a book about the incident. The book, ""The Love-Sick Boy,"" is published by Simon & Schuster, Inc., at £16.99. For more information on the book, visit www.suspectbook.co.uk.

0.43,0.53,38.9,"The author was alone with her dying husband in a New York boarding-house. She was plunged in the profoundest grief that can come to the human soul. She gazed dully at the unconscious breathing form of the man who had been friend, and companion, and lover, during five years of youth too vigorous and hopeful to be warped by uneven fortune. She sat there in the darkness, looking at the man she had loved for five years.. She leaned suddenly over him. He was in there still, somewhere. Where? If he had not ceased to breathe, the Ego, the Soul,, the Personality was still in the sodden clay which had shaped to give it speech. She repeated the words twice, and, after them, ""forever."" And the while the sweetness of their pressure came back to her.. The dying man took no notice of her, and she opened his gown and put her cheek to his heart, calling him again. There had never been more perfect union; how could the bond still be so strong if he were not at the other end of it? He was there, her other part; until dead he must be living. Why should he be as entombed and unresponding as if the screws were in the lid? But the faintly beating heart did not quicken beneath her lips.. The green plots in the yards were not apparent, she noticed. Something heavy, like a pall, rested upon them. Then she understood that the day was over and that night was coming. She returned swiftly to the bedside, wondering if she had remained away hours or seconds, and if he were dead. His face was still discernible, and Death had not relaxed it. She laid her own against it, then withdrew it with shuddering flesh.. The author sat with her hand on her husband's heart as he died. She could not hear his breathing, but knew he was dying. She made a motion to kiss him, then threw herself back in a quiver of agony. She sat there in the hot heavy night, pressing her hand hard against the ebbing heart of the unseen, and awaited Death. She felt Death was drawing near with footsteps as measured as those of men keeping time to a funeral march.. She drew her brows together angrily, wondering at her levity, and pressed her relaxed palm against the heart it kept guard over. For a moment the sweat stood on her face; then the pent-up breath burst from her lungs. Death--where was he? What a curious experience: to be sitting alone in a big house--waiting for Death to come and snatch her husband from her. No; he would not snatch, he would steal upon his prey as noiselessly as. She realized that she was horribly frightened. Something was creeping over the window-sill. Two small green stars glared menacingly at her just above the sill. Then the cat possessing them leaped downward, and the stars disappeared. She was still quaking as she resumed her seat, and laid her hand again on his heart. She wished that she had asked Mary to sit outside the door. To call would be worse than desecrating the house of God.. She bent to him who had been her protector with a spasm of anger. Where was the indomitable spirit that had held her all these years with such strong and loving clasp? How could he leave her? Her head fell back and moved restlessly against the cushion; moaning with the agony of loss. Then fear once more took possession of her, and she sat erect, rigid, breathless, awaiting the approach of Death.. Her face, her body, were wet--as if a wave of death-sweat had broken over them. There was a stiff feeling at the roots of her hair; she wondered if it were really standing erect. Her muscles were flabby, her nerves twitched helplessly. She knew that it was Death who was coming to her through the silent deserted house. She gave a hysterical gasp. Where was the slow music?. She was no longer a human being; she was an Intelligence and an EAR. She counted the steps--one--two--three--irritated beyond endurance at the long deliberate pauses between. She wished she knew how many steps had the stair. She calculated that they would finish, just as those footfalls paused beside the bed. She was an intelligence and an ear. She knew she was not alone.. The knocking became more imperious; the very walls vibrated. Mary opened the door and entered the room she found a dead woman lying across a dead man. With a wild instinctive movement she flung herself into the arms of her husband."
0.6,0.7,50.07022471910112,"The great author had realized one of the dreams of his ambitious youth, the possession of an ancestral hall in England. It was not so much the good American's reverence for ancestors that inspired the longing to consort with the ghosts of an ancient line, as artistic appreciation of the mellowness of walls that have sheltered, and furniture that has embraced, generations and generations of the dead. The dumping of the old interiors of Europe into the glistening shells of the United States not only roused him almost to passionate protest, but. Orth had left the United States soon after his first successes, and, his art being too great to be confounded with locality, he had long since ceased to be spoken of as an American author. All civilized Europe furnished stages for his puppets, and if never picturesque nor impassioned, his originality was as overwhelming as his style. His subtleties might not always be understood--indeed, as a rule, they were not--but the musical mystery of his language and the penetrating charm of his lofty and cultivated mind induced raptures in the initiated.. Orth was too wary to become a fad, and too sophisticated to grate or bore. He was not keenly addicted to sport, but he could handle a gun. All men respected his dignity and breeding. They cared less for his books than women did, perhaps because patience is not a characteristic of their sex. A group of young literary men--and one or two women--put him on a pedestal and kissed the earth before it. He had come to be regarded as one of them, and long since he had been regarded as a man. The author was made heir to a large estate by his great-aunt. He was a prolific writer, but he longed for his own acres. He wrote many ""appreciations"" of his books, which no living person could understand. He died in London in 1881. He is survived by his wife, two children, and a daughter. He leaves behind a son, a daughter, a son and a son-in-law, and two grandchildren.. The place gratified all his ideals and dreams--for he had romanced about his sometime English possession as he had never dreamed of woman. It was not a castle nor a great property, but it was quite perfect. He often laid his hand against the rough ivied walls in a lingering caress. After a time, he returned the hospitalities of his friends, and his invitations, given with the exclusiveness of his great distinction, were never refused. He smiled with cynicism, not unmixed with sadness; but he was very grateful for the money. He bought him a country-seat.. Chillingsworth was a lonely man. Americans visiting England eagerly sought for letters to him. Women invariably described him as ""brilliant,"" a few men affirmed that he was gentle and lovable. He was well content to spend weeks at Chillingsworth with no other companion. It occurred to him how lonely he was one gay June morning when the sunlight was streaming through his narrow windows, illuminating tapestries and armor, the family portraits of the young profligate from whom he had made this splendid purchase, dusting its gold on the black wood of wainscot and floor. The boy's expression was imperious and radiant.. Orth looked at a portrait of a little girl who was quite unlike the boy, yet so perfect in her own way, and so unmistakably painted by the same hand. She was angelically fair, and, young as she was--she could not have been more than six years old--her dark-blue eyes had a beauty of mind which must have been remarkable twenty years later. She wore a long white frock, and clasped tightly against her breast a doll far more gorgeously arrayed than herself. Orth turned away abruptly, only to find himself face to face with the portrait of the girl.. Orth had studied this portrait many times, for the sake of an art which he understood almost as well as his own; but to-day he saw only the lovely child. He forgot even the boy in the intensity of this new and personal absorption. Behind her were the ruins and the woods of Chillingsworth. ""She should have made a remarkable, even a famous woman, with those eyes and that brow, but--could the spirit within that ethereal frame stand the enlightenments of maturity? Would not that mind--purged, perhaps, in a long probation from the dross of. ""I wish these children were alive,"" he thought. ""I am mooning like a barren woman,"" he exclaimed. He ransacked the library, and finally brought to light the gallery catalogue which had been named in the inventory. ""The dead's kindly recognition of the dead,"" he said, ""But I wish these kids were alive."" For a week he haunted the gallery, and the children haunted him. Then he became impatient and angry. He went back to his work, chiselling a story which was to be the foremost excuse of a magazine as yet unborn.. The Viscount Tancred and the Lady Blanche Mortlake were son and daughter of the second Earl of Teignmouth. He wrote to the present earl, asking for some account of the lives of the children. He awaited the answer with more restlessness than he usually permitted himself, and took long walks.. ""I'm such a beastly idiot about expressing myself, that I wouldn't dare to write to you at all if you weren't really great,"" wrote the author. The author was gratified that the girl had died young, but grieved for the boy. Although he had avoided the gallery of late, his practised imagination had evoked from the throngs of history the high-handed and brilliant, surely adventurous career of the third Earl of Teignmouth. ""Would that they were, and scampering about this park,"" he wrote.. He had pondered upon the deep delights of directing such a mind and character, and had caught himself envying the dust that was older still. When he read of the lad's early death, in spite of his regret that such promise should have come to naught, he admitted to a secret thrill of satisfaction that the boy had so soon ceased to belong to any one. ""I believe I not only wish those children were alive, but that they were my own,"" he admitted. ""What an old fool I am!"". Before he had written three chapters, he knew that he was at work upon a masterpiece. He was experiencing a pleasure so keen that once and again his hand trembled, and he saw the page through a mist. The old mansion echoed with their laughter, with their delightful and original pranks. He had loved and brooded over them long ere he had thought to tuck them into his pen, and on its first stroke they danced out alive. Mr Mr Mr. Mr. Caulfield was a man of no delusions. He knew his highest satisfaction in chiselling the statuettes, extracting subtle and elevating harmonies.. Orth knew nothing of children, therefore all the pranks he invented were as original as his faculty. He ignored the second Lord Teignmouth; he was himself their father. Oddly enough, the children had no mother, not even the memory of one. Orth wrote the book more slowly than was his wont, and spent delightful hours pondering upon the chapter of the morrow. He looked forward to the conclusion with a sort of terror, and made up his mind that when the inevitable last word was written he should start at once for Homburg. He was a man of the world, and he was a son of the earth.. He nerved himself to nurse the little girl through her wasting illness, and when he clasped her hands, his own shook, his knees trembled. Desolation settled upon the house, and he wished he had left one corner of it to which he could retreat unhaunted by the child's presence. He took long tramps, avoiding the river with a sensation next to panic. For two months he lived in his fool's paradise, and then he knew that the book must end. He was driven to the brink of madness. His eyes hungered for them. They were his now.. Orth's boxes were packed. He sent the manuscript to his publisher an hour after it was finished. He left the next morning for Homburg. There, in inmost circles, he forgot his children. He visited in several of the great houses of the Continent until November. He returned to London to find his book the literary topic of the day. His secretary handed him the reviews. For once in a way he read the finalities of the nameless. He knew then how men feel when their sons go forth to encounter the world and ask no more of the old. companionship.. Ralph Orth was hailed as a genius, and compared in astonished phrases to the prodigiously clever talent which the world for twenty years had isolated under the name of Ralph Orth. Orth had waited twenty years; but his past was bedecked with the headstones of geniuses long since forgotten. He was gratified to come thus publicly into his estate, but soon reminded himself that all the adulation of which a belated world was capable could not. Orth's estate was in Hertfordshire, a Wordsworthian shire, steeped in the deepest peace of England. He cancelled all his engagements and went down to Chillingsworth. He spent a haunted night, but the next day stranger happenings began. The ivy on his old gray towers had been young with his children. He had a typical English sunset to gaze upon, a red streak with a church spire against it. His woods were silent. In the fields, the cows stood as if conscious of their part.. Orth, like others of the transplanted, experienced to the full the country's gift of foot-restlessness and mental calm. Calm flees, however, when the ego is rampant, and to-day, as upon others too recent, Orth's soul was as restless as his feet. He had walked for two hours when he entered the wood of his neighbor's estate, a domain seldom honored by him. He heard children's voices, and turned with the quick prompting of retreat. As he did so, he came face to face, on the narrow path, with a little girl. For the moment he was possessed by the most hideous sensation which can visit a. Orth took the child's hand in his. It was very warm and soft. ""Take me to your mother,"" he said, firmly; ""now, at once"" ""I'm Mrs. Jennie Root's little girl--my father's dead. My name is Blanche--you are sick! No?--and I live in Rome, New York State"" ""We've come over here to visit pa's relations,"" the child said. ""I never had so many questions asked me all at once,"" the girl said.. The child led him to an old house, where an old man was reading his Bible. The old man said: ""You can return and play afterwards. And as I wouldn't have you disappointed for the world, I'll send to town for a beautiful doll"" The child said: 'I'll go with you, please.' The man replied: 'Yes, of course, I will.' The pair went back to the house and played for a while. The child then said: 'I'll take you to the park, and you can play with the other children'. The ceiling was supported by the trunk of a tree, black, and probably petrified. The windows had still their diamond panes, separated, no doubt, by the original lead. Beyond was a large kitchen in which were several women. ""Of course you've fallen in love with Blanche, sir, "" said one of them. ""Everybody does"" ""Yes, that is it. Quite so."" Confusion still prevailing among his faculties, he clung to the naked truth.. ""He'll never talk of family secrets,"" said an elderly woman, who introduced herself as the old man's daughter. ""There are secrets in every family, and we have ours, but he'll never tell those old tales. All I can tell you is that an ancestor of little Blanche went to wreck and ruin because of some fine lady's doings, and killed himself"" The story is that his boys turned out bad. One of them saw his crime, and never got over the shock; he was foolish like, after. The mother was a poor scared sort of creature, and hadn't much influence over the other boy.. Orth typed the woman as belonging to the small middle-class of an interior town of the eastern United States. He learned that the woman's husband had kept a hat store in Rome, New York; that her boys were clerks, her girls in stores, or type-writing. For the moment, he forgot the child. He questioned, and learned, that her sons were clerks and her girls were type-writers. He also learned that she had a daughter, and that she looked like any lady's child. Orth gasped. It was the first time he had ever heard a native American use the term. The Root family were all very happy together. All were robust, except Blanche. They kept her and little Blanche--who had come after her other children were well grown--in comfort. The boys broke out, occasionally; but, on the whole, were the best in the world, and her girls were worthy of far better than they had. ""Is that really all you can tell me?"" he asked. ""That's all,"" replied the daughter of the house. ""And you couldn't pry open father's mouth."". ""She was so white and dainty, she just looked it."" The creative gift is in very close relationship with the Great Force behind the universe; for aught we know, may be an atom thereof. The author of ""The Secret Life of Bees"" was inspired by the experience of his own child. The book is published by Simon & Schuster, priced £16.99.

What relation was she to the lady who drove the young man to destruction?"" ""The closest,"" interrupted Lady Mildred. ""She was herself!"" ""The most beautiful woman I have ever seen,"" said Orth, ""and I've seen a lot."" ""I'm not sure what I'm doing here,"" said the woman, ""but I'm sure I'm not doing anything wrong."". ""Wally was up here just after I read your book, and I discovered he had given you the wrong history of the picture,"" Lady Mildred said. ""Blanche Mortlake--that Blanche-- there had been several of her name, but there has not been one since--did not die in childhood, but lived to be twenty-four. She was an angelic child, but little angels sometimes grow up into very naughty girls,"" she said. Lady Milded, gratified by the success of her bolt, proceeded less dramatically: ""I think you would probably become a monomani. ""She was alone one summer at Chillingsworth--where she had taken temporary refuge from her husband"" ""She amused herself--some say, fell in love--with a young man of the yeomanry, a tenant of the next estate"" ""He was wild about her, and she pretended to be about him. Perhaps she was, for women have stooped before and since"" ""The worst, and what makes the ugliest stain in our annals, is to come"" ""We are not to be surprised by the worst of the worst"". Orth followed her, and forced his way into her house. It is said she melted, but made him swear never to attempt to see her again. He returned to his home, and killed himself. A few months later she took her own life. That is all I know. It was quite enough for me,"" said Orth. The next night, as his train travelled over the great wastes of Lancashire, a thousand chimneys were spouting forth columns of fire. Where the sky was not red it was black. The place looked like hell. Another time Orth's imagination would have gathered immediate inspiration from this wildest region of England.. Orth was in a subjective world, searching for all he had ever heard of occultism. He recalled that the sinful dead are doomed, according to this belief, to linger for vast reaches of time in that borderland which is close to earth. Only those who dare to make mistakes succeed greatly, only those who shake free the wings of their imagination brush, once in a way, the secrets of the great pale world, he writes. The author's work has been published in several editions, including the latest edition of The Doors of Perception, published by Oxford University Press.. Orth's love for the child was so strong that he monopolised her. He had a room fitted up as a nursery and filled with the wonders of toyland. He took her to London to see the pantomimes and buy presents for her relatives. Before a month had passed she was living in state at Chillingsworth and paying d. The author's wife, who died in 2011, was a friend of the family. She died of cancer in 2012. The novel was published in 1881. It is now considered one of the greatest novels ever written."

He had been sent to a Lycee in Paris at the age of twelve, graduated from the University of Paris at twenty-two. He returned to San Francisco upon the death of his father a year later.. Louis le Grand was sent to the College Louis le Grand by his parents. He became a prodigal with his pen. The entire French colony read these letters. He was practising on his family. After many mutations his style became so formal and precise that M. Dupont became alarmed. Cesar Dupont had not seen Louis for several years. He asked, abruptly: ""Have you given a thought to your future career, Louis?"" Louis's lip curled. ""I have no more intention of being a professor than of beinga merchant,"" he said in his cold, precise voice.. Louis Dupont's father asked his son if he would write a novel. Louis was shy, but said he would. He was also a realist by temperament and mental habit. ""Romance? No, Monsieur. Nor do I need the great world. Only one thing interests me--crime."". ""I shall never care for society, for I am too timid and dislike women"" ""I love the lonely grandeur of nature, and music, and great books and pictures"" ""But--that is it--your gifts are literary--but yes!"" ""I do not like the idea of wasting them on that lamentable subdivision of human society"". ""Be careful of that style of yours, my son. It is growing a little too academic"" ""I purpose to write novels--not mere stories"" ""With them crime is an incident, not a motif"" ""You would also make money as well as achieve fame"" ""Quite so"". ""When I shall write as spontaneously as the spring bubbles or the ice melts, when my brain hardly knows what my pen is doing, when I experience that terrific uprush that would drown the more conscious parts of the intellect were it not for the perfect mastery of technique--that is it, monsieur! I am still an infant with my tools. Do not permit my style to cause. ""I wish to live in my mind, my imagination,"" writes the author. ""I wish ... to spend every hour when I do not exercise for my nerves or sleep to refresh my faculty, in writing, writing--that one day shall be creating"" ""I hate it--realities. I hate it,"" he writes.. The last revision was devoted exclusively to the study and improvement of every sentence in the long book. Three successive sets of servants, mistaking this accomplishment in petrifaction for a form of insanity which might at any moment express itself in violence, left abruptly. Finally, old Madame Dupont established in the kitchen wing an elderly Frenchman and his wife who had once presided over a hotel. Louis van Gaal was hailed by the intellectuals, but fell short of popular recognition. He was determined to enthrall, to create the perfect illusion. He always felt, despite his love of his work, as cold and deliberate as a mathematician. And yet he spun his complicated plots with the utmost facility.. Louis XIV was a French writer born in San Francisco in 18th century. He was a follower of Cesar Dupont, who was a monk in the Middle Ages. He spent his days writing, taking his walks at midnight, never leaving the house otherwise unless to visit a bookstore or sit in the back of a box at the play.. Louis XIV was a friend of M. Cesar's, and they dined together at the old Dupont mansion on Nob Hill. Louis was suffering from an influenza and his mother was in bed with an influenza. Louis paced up and down the library and unburdened himself while. M. Cesar made the comment about every seven months. He loved Louis, who was sweet of nature, but was beginning to regard him as hopeless. To-night, however, he was admitting a ray of hope.. Louis Bac is a great admirer of M. Louis Bac, celebrated novelist. He has given up a dinner at the club to a distinguished guest from abroad to tell you that I insist you give yourself one more chance. Louis was alert and suspicious at once.. ""I have lost my old longing for Paris. What difference where a failure exists and plods?"" ""I feel convinced that she alone could make you fall madly in love--"" Louis was quite cold. ""A wife in my house! Oh no, M. Cesar; I should hate it. Louis was petrified. Cesar rose and laid his hand solemnly on his young friend's shoulder. ""For your art, my son, for your divine gift. For both you would lay down your life. Is it not? Another year of this unnatural existence and you will go sterile. And what substitute for you?"". Louis sat at his bedroom window, for the moon was high and the night was clear. He stared instead at the cross on Calvary, that gaunt hill that rises above the cemeteries of Lone Mountain. The emblem of the cross was in tune with his mood to-night, for he felt neither romantic nor imaginative. The writer's spirits have remained so persistently at zero as during the past week. Never before had their melancholy been darkened by fear, rent by panic. He would go out to Lone Mountain, shut himself in the family vault, lie down on the stones, and either drink poison or cut his wrists.. Louis had for some time believed, with his critics and M. Cesar, that he would come into the full fruition of his gifts only after some great, possibly terrific, adventure of the soul had banished forever that curious lethargy that possessed the unexplored tracts of his genius. He was willing to go to the stake.. The old butler was forced to leave his post in the middle of the day. He had to go back to his office and get his car. He was going to be late for work, but decided to take a break in the garden. The garden was full of flowers, and he wanted to see them.. Louis observed with delight that she was more than pretty, and realized that M. Cesar had with purpose restrained his enthusiasm. Certainly it gave Louis a distinct throb of satisfaction to discover for himself that the young girl was beautiful and of no common type. She might be as practical as most Frenchwomen, but she looked romantic, passionate, mysterious.. Louis Bac felt neither jealousy nor any other of the master passions. He appreciated that the young lady destined for him was intelligent, and emanated a warm magnetism. She had both coquetry and indubitable sincerity. Every man at the table was craning his neck, and M. Constant looked ready to fight twelve duels. And he, Louis Bac. Louis was infatuated with Berthe Dupont, but he felt no desire to impropriate her. He was incapable of those profound and racking passions experienced once at least by ordinary men. He had a rotten spot where fiction generated instead of those abnormal impulses that made of men so inflicted social outlaws. It was Berthe for him or no one.. ""It was night--a beautiful, romantic night. Berthe was beautiful, seductive at all times"" ""He ran lightly down the stairs and let himself out of the house as silently, although his servants slept far in the rear"" ""Even at the top of the hill not a policeman nor a chance pedestrian was in sight"". Louis was walking along Taylor Street when he heard a taxicab in his wake. He darted within the sheltering walls of the covered stair. A man with a black bag jumped out, and was immediately admitted. Louis, to his surprise, discovered that he was experiencing something. Louis ran lightly up the stairs, dismissing even the agreeable idea that he was also to experience the sensation of being his own housebreaker, so to speak. When he reached the upper terrace he took off his shoes and carried them to a little pagoda behind the house. It was possible that he would have to make a hasty exit by way of Jones Street.. Louis knew every detail of that room; he crept down its length without encountering a chair, and opened the door. He knew that Madame had given the jeune fille the room next to hers, but the connecting door was sure to be closed. If Madame heard the slightest sound she would ring the bell connecting with the servants' rooms in the mansard.. Berthe lay with her arms tossed outward, her head thrown back, as if consciously drawing attention to the classic outlines under the firm flesh. Louis, his heart thumping, but his head cool and his hands quiet, walked over to the bed. He did not feel that intoxication of the senses, that unreckoning fury of the male, that. He hated her unreasonably for disappointing him, for failing to melt the ice in his blood. He would make her believe she was being murdered, then get out while she was still too terrified and breathless to cry for help. He picked up a pillow she had tossed to the floor and pressed it against her face. She made a sudden downward movement, gurgling.. Louis had forgotten his original intention merely to terrify. The literary cultures in his brain had suddenly become personal and imperative. He was as ruthless as man ever is when supreme desire and opportunity coincide. He meant to kill Berthe Dupont and gratify the clamoring male within him to the full. He desired to stop it. His head was light and full of pleasant noises.. The body lay limp and flabby at last. He was about to remove the pillow, but his artistic soul uncurled itself and made indignant protest. He lifted the clammy hand and felt the pulse. It was still. So was the heart to which he laid his ear briefly. This was his moment.. He found Berthe's jewel-box in another drawer, wrenched a few diamonds from their setting and threw a brooch"
0.28,0.38,26.35761589403974,"Weigall, continental and detached, tired early of grouse shooting. But when in England in August he always accepted whatever proffered for the season. The amusements of life, he argued, should be accepted with the same philosophy as its ills.. Weigall's friend, the chum of his college days, disappeared two days ago. He had been making love to Adeline Cavan, and apparently in the best of spirits. Weigall: ""I'm not sure why I'm here, but I'm glad I. The body of the man who was reported missing has not yet been found. He was last seen leaving the hotel in the early hours of the morning. The body was not found until the morning of August 2, 2013. He had been missing for two days.. Weigall walked through the woods until he was ready for sleep. He smiled as he recalled a remark of Gifford's: ""An English wood is like a good many other things in life-- very promising at a distance, but a hollow mockery when you get within"". Weigall strolled along, smoking, and thinking of his friend, his pranks. They had walked the streets one hot night after a party, discussing the various theories of the soul's destiny. That afternoon they met at the coffin of a college friend whose mind had been a blank for the past. ""I cherish the theory,"" Gifford had said, ""that the soul sometimes lingers in the body after death"" ""During madness, of course, it is an impotent prisoner, albeit a conscious one,"" Weigall had replied. ""Fancy its agony, and its horror!"". ""Absolutely. The body and soul are twins, life comrades--sometimes friends, sometimes enemies, but always loyal in the last instance"" ""Suppose you were not sealed up properly, and returned after one of your astral flights to find your earthly part unfit for habitation?"". Weigall was not a coward, but he recalled uncomfortably the tales of those that had been done to death in the Strid. He left the wood and walked out on the huge slippery stones which nearly close the River Wharfe at this point.. Weigall stood, visioning skeletons, uncoffined and green, the home of the eyeless things which had devoured all that had covered and filled that rattling symbol of man's mortality. It was covered with slime; he had never seen it look so. Weigall dashed to the nearest tree, dragged and twisted off a branch with his strong arms, and returned as swiftly to the Strid. The hand was in the same place, still gesticulating as wildly; the body was undoubtedly caught in the rocks below. Weigall let himself down upon a lower. Weigall forgot the slippery stones, the terrible death if he stepped too far. He pulled with passionate will and muscle. The fingers clutching the branch were as familiar as his own. Most of the pleasures of his life, good and bad, were identified in some way with this friend.. Weigall had loved several women; but he would have flouted in these moments the thought that he had ever loved any woman as he loved Wyatt Gifford. There were so many charming women in the world, and in the thirty-two years of his life he had never known another man to whom he had cared to give. Weigall plunged into the shallow pool, lifted Gifford in his arms and returned to the bank. He laid the body down and threw off his coat that he might be the freer to practise the methods of resuscitation. But he sprang to the side of the man and bent down and peered into his face. There was no"

His niece Ag- gie was a plump girl with clear blue eyes.. Sam Gates met his niece twice a day. She always said, in exactly the same voice: ""Well, uncle, is there any noos?"" He had never lived further than five miles from Halvesham. For nearly sixty of those years he had bent his back above the soil.. He had had many interesting chats with Mr. James at "" The Cowman,"" and three years ago had sold a pig to Mrs. Waig. There was also a famous occasion when he had visited London. Didn't the silly gaffer know that for the last three weeks he had been thinning out turnips for Mr. Dodge on this very same. He noticed the back of Aggie disappear in the distance. It was a mile to the cottage, and a mile and a half to Halvesham. He dismissed her from his thoughts and took a long swig of tea out of a bottle. In some dim way he felt happy in his solitude amidst this sweeping immensity of earth.. The war was "" a plaguey noosance,"" said Sam Gates. He spat on his hands, and blinked up at the sky. And suddenly the aeroplane behaved in a very extraordinary manner. It was well over the sea when it seemed to lurch in a drunken manner.. Sam Gates was in a terrible state. The aeroplane was more than a hundred yards away. He waved his arms, and called out: ""Hi ! you there, you mustn't land in they swedes ! They're Mister Dodge's"". Sam approached within earshot of the aviator, and cried out: ""You mustn't rest your old airj'plane here. You've kicked up all Mr. Dodge's swedes. A nice thing you've done ! "" The aviator turned and covered him with a revolver.. Sam sat watching the madman work fever- ishlv. At the end of ten minutes he seemed to have solved his troubles with the machine, but he still seemed very scared. When his repairs were completed, he straightened his back and wiped the perspiration from his brow.. The aviator muttered some words that sounded some- thing like "" mare vudish ! "" and then turned to his ma- chine. He appeared to be dazed and in a great state of doubt. He fumbled with some. Old Sam w^as hale and hearty. He had no desire to die so ignominiously. The pleasant smell of the downland was in his nostrils. He mounted the seat of the car, content- ing himself with a mutter: ""Flyin' about the country with all they tarn. Sam was borne up above his fields and out to sea. He felt in some vague way that he was going to die. He offered up a mild prayer to God, Who, he felt, must be very near. He could not turn in his seat and he could see nothing but sea and sky.. He was protected by a screen, but it seemed very cold. He felt out-raged and yet at moments there was something entranc- ing in the wild experience. He seemed to be living at an incredible pace. Perhaps he was really dead, and on his way to the Kingdom of God ? Perhaps this was the way they took people ?. The pilot was flying through the sky above a foreign country. He thought the machine was blown to pieces, but then it dived and ducked through the air. He felt the thing glide gently and bump into a field. Some men ran forward and approached them, and the mad aviator called out to them. They all spoke this foreign gibberish.. The mad aviator pointed at Sam and said something, and the man with the medals started at sight of him, and then came up and spoke to him in English. He seemed intensely interested, and also pulled his hair and beard to see if they came off. So well and naturally did he and the aviator speak English that after a voluble cross-examination they. ""It is a most remarkable resemblance,"" said the man with medals. "" Paul Jouperts has given us more valuable information than any one at present in our service,"" he said. ""There is an award of twenty-five thousand francs on liis head"". The English are attacking Hill 701, which we have for tactical reasons decided to evacuate. If after the at- tack they find the dead body of Paul Jouperts in, say, the second lines, they will take no further trouble in the matter. And consequently Paul Jou perts will be able to prosecute his lab. Old Sam felt that somehow things were not becoming too promising, and it was time to assert himself. The English attacked unexpectedly at dawn. We have already evacuated the first line. We shall evacuate the second line at eleven-fifty. It is now ten-fifteen. There may be just time."". The country was barren and horrible, full of great pits and rents, and he could hear the roar of artillery and the shriek of shells. Overhead, aeroplanes were buzzing angrily. He seemed to be suddenly trans- ported from the Kingdom of God to the Pit of Dark-. The party hurried out and dived behind a mound. He was pulled down a kind of shaft and found himself in a room buried right underground. Three officers were drinking and smoking. One came up and pulled his beard and spat in his face, and called him "" an old English swine"". Old Sam lay panting against the mud wall, expecting every minute to be blown to pieces by one of those infernal things. He fancied he heard a whistle amidst the din. Suddenly one of the soldiers who had accompanied him came stealthily round the corner. When he was within five yards the soldier raised his rifle and pointed it at Sam's body.. He was lying on the ground, and a man came up and said: ""Well, old thing, you were very nearly in hell. Who the devil are you?"" He replied: "" Ay, I can walk all right."" The man helped him out of the room, into a courtyard. ""By God! It's Paul Jouperts!"" exclaimed the colonel. The officer looked up, and exclaimed: ""Good God ! Bradshaw, do you know who you've got. ""Good ! damn good ! Isn't it amazing, sir, the way they not only leam the language, but even take the trouble to leam a dialect ? "" The older man busied himself with some papers. ""Let's. ""I sits under the Reverend David Pryce, mister, and a good God-fearin' man he be"" ""I works for Mr. Dodge what owns Greenway Manor and 'as a stud.

""Ye haven't a bite o' somethin' to eat, I suppose, mister, and a glass o' beer ? I usually 'as my dinner at twelve o'clock"" The officer saluted and went out, and in a few minutes a tray of hot food and a large bottle of beer was brought to the old man. The colonel smoked a pipe while waiting for a message. The gardener at the convent of St. Eloise had been arrested. The police had every reason to believe that he was Paul Jouperts. The colonel's eyes beamed as he smoked.. "" Oi want to get back 'ome in toime for tea,"" he said. Colonel says, ""You will probably hear more of this. You have probably been the means of delivering something very useful into our hands. Your own honor is vindicated"". Commander Jennings is leaving at three o'clock,"" said the colonel.

An old lady down the street had died from pneumonia the previous evening, and the event supplied a fruitful topic of conversation.Prominent in this little group was Baldwin Meadows, a sallow-faced villain with battered features and prominent cheek-bones, his face cut and scarred by a hundred fights. By his side lurched an enormous coloured man who went by the name of Harry Jones. No one knew how he lived. And so—one foregathered in a cheerful spot amidst friends, and drank forgetfulness. The things that one could get! Everywhere were germs eager to destroy one.. The Agent was a pimply-faced young man who was known as The Agent. He had no other name, and most emphatically no address, but he ""arranged things"" for people, and appeared to thrive upon it in a scrambling, fugitive manner. The other two people were Mr. and Mrs. Dawes, who were both negative people. Mrs. Daws' aunt used to work in a corset shop in Wych Street. When she said that, The Agent remarked: ""Where was Wych St, ma?"" ""Lord!"" exclaimed Mrs Dawes. ""Don't you know, dearie? You must be a young 'un"". Baldwin Meadows cleared his throat, and said: ""Wych Street used to be a turnin' runnin' from Long Acre into Wellington Street."" ""Oh, no, old boy,"" chipped in Mr. Dawes, who always treated the ex-man with great deference. ""If you'll excuse me, Wych Street was a narrow lane at the back of the old Globe Theatre, that used to pass by the church"" ""I know what I'm talkin' about,"" growled Meadows.. ""The Gallows Ring"" was not popular in Wapping, for the reason that many of their depredations had been inflicted upon their own class. Their leader, Ben Orming, had served seven years for bashing a Chinaman down at Rotherhithe. Every member of ""The Gallow's Ring"" had done time, but they still carried on a lucrative industry devoted to blackmail, intimidation, shoplifting, and some of the clumsier recreations. When Meadows and Harry Jones took it into their heads to do a little wild prancing they took the trouble to go up into the West-end of Wapping.. The Gallows Ring was an ungentlemanly set, but they always treated them with a certain external deference. Something had evidently miscarried with the Ring. They considered the Ring an unpleasant crowd to quarrel with. The three of them sat in a bar and whispered in sullen accents. Mrs. Dawes said: ""Ben, you're a hot old devil, you are. We was just 'aving a discussion like. Where was Wych. ""I know where Wych Street was—it was just sarth of the river, afore yer come to Waterloo Station,"" he said. Meadows turned on him fiercely. ""What the blazes does a blanketty nigger know abaht it?"" he asked. ""Yer both wrong, cap'n. You's. ""I didn't ask yer what you thought,"" growled Ben. ""Well, I suppose I've a right to an opinion?"" ""You always think you know everything, you do,"" said Mrs. Dawes. ""You can just keep yer mouth shut,"" said Ben. The affair might have been subsided at that point, but for Mrs. Dawes' emotions over the death of the old lady in the street had been so stirred that she had been, almost unconsciously, drinking too much gin.. ""The Gallows Ring"" fought two men and a woman. Mr. Dawes merely stood in a corner and screamed out: ""Don't! Don't!"" Mrs Dawes stabbed the man who had pushed her through the wrist with a hatpin. Meadows and Ben Orming closed on each other and fought savagely with the naked fists. The whole affair was a matter of minutes. Mr Booth was bawling out in the street. People were running in all directions. The pain maddened him to a frenzy. A whistle sounded. The bar was in a complete state of pandemonium. In three minutes the bar was. in a state of. pandemonium.. Ben and the other man, whose name was Toller, dashed to the door. On the pavement there was a confused scramble. Two policemen appeared. One was laid hors de combat by a kick on the knee-cap from Toller. The two men fled into the darkness, followed by a hue-and-cry. They tacked through alleys and raced down dark mews, and clambered over walls. Fortunately for them, the people they passed, who might have tripped them up or aided in the pursuit, merely fled indoors. The people in Wapping are not always on the side of the pursuer. But the police held on.. The siege of Aztec Street lasted three days and four nights. On forcing a panel of the front door, Sub-Inspector Wraithe, of the V Division, was shot through the chest. You may remember that, on forcing aPanel of theFront door, sub-instructor Wraitshe was shot. The siege ofAztec Street. lasted three day and four night. The Siege of Azteca Street, was a siege of London, England, by the British Army. The Battle of the Bulge, August 1914, was fought on Aztec St, London. The battle was won by the Army, who were supported by the Royal Marines.. Ben Orming's body was never found, but that of Toller was discovered near the front door with a bullet through his heart. Whether killed by a chance bullet from a sniper or whether killed deliberately by his fellow-criminal was never revealed. For when the end came Orming had apparently planned a final act of venom. It was known that in the basement a considerable quantity of petrol had been stored. The contents had probably been carefully distributed over the most inflammable materials in the top rooms. The fire broke out, as one witness described it, ""almost like an explosion."" Orming must have perished in this. The roof blazed up, and the sparks carried across the yard and started a stack of light timber in the annexe of Messrs. Morrel's piano-factory.. The factory and two blocks of tenement buildings were burnt to the ground. The estimated cost of the destruction was one hundred and eighty thousand pounds. The casualties amounted to seven killed and fifteen wounded. At one point a certain Mrs. Dawes was put in the box. At the inquiry held under Chief Justice Pengammon various odd interesting facts were revealed. Mr. Lowes-Parlby, the brilliant young K.C., distinguished himself by his searching. ""We was arguin' as to where Wych Street was, sir."" ""Wych Street? Do you mean W-Y-C-H?"" ""Yes, sir"" ""Well, what was the subject of the dispute?"" ""Diseases!"" ""Was there a serious dispute about diseases?"" "". ""Mr. Lowes-Parlby, when I was your age I used to pass through Wych Street every day of my life. I think it hardly necessary for you to contradict me."" ""Yes, my lord, I believe the witness refers to the same street you mention, though, if I may be allowed to qualify your lordship's description of the locality,"" replied the counsel. ""Well, sir, my aunt who died from eating tinned lobster used to work at a corset-shop. I ought. ""Oh, no, Mr. Backer!"" exclaimed Lowes-Parlby. It was not his place to dispute with a chief justice, although that chief justice be a hopeless old fool. Another eminent K.C., an elderly man with a tawny beard, rose in the body of the court, and said: ""If I may be allowed to interpose, your lordship, I also spent a great deal of my youth passing through Wych Street"" ""The matter is entirely irrelevant to the case,"" replied the chief justice. ""It certainly was,"" said the witness.. The findings of this Special Inquiry do not concern us. It is sufficient to say that the witnesses already mentioned all returned to Wapping. The man who had received the thrust of a hatpin through his wrist did not think it advisable to take any action against Mrs. Dawes. The coloured man, Harry Jones, had died in hospital, but Mr. Booth, the proprietor of the Wagtail, Baldwin Meadows, Mr. Dawe, and the man who was stabbed in the wrist, all gave evidence of a rather nugatory character. Lowes-Parlby could do nothing with it. He was pleasantly relieved to find that he was only required as a witness of an abortive discussion.. Francis Lowes-Parlby, K.C. was one of the darlings of the gods. His father had distinguished himself at the bar before him, and had amassed a modest fortune. At Oxford he had carried off every possible degree. Lady Adela Charters, the daughter of Lord Vermeer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, was his fiancée. She was young and almost pretty, and Lord Ver meer was immensely wealthy and one of Britain's most influential men. Such a combination was irresistible. There seemed to be nothing missing in the life of Francis Lowes Parl by. He liked to give the appearance of knowing everything. The brilliant career just ahead of him at times dazzled him.. He attended every meeting of the Aztec Street inquiry, but from beginning to end he never volunteered an opinion. He had never taken sick, never eaten the requisite dinners, never passed an examination in his life; but the law of evidence was meat and drink to him. He passed his life in the Temple, where he had chambers. Some of the most eminent counsel in the world would take his opinion, or come to him for advice. He was very old, very silent, and very absorbed. He entered the particulars in a little book which he kept for purposes of that kind. But before doing so, he entered a little apophthegm in another book.. Old Stephen was present at the dinner at Lord Vermeer's. The sentence ran: ""The basic trouble is that people make statements without sufficient data"" The reason for this was to impress Mr. Sandeman, the London agent of the Ameer of Bakkan. The story of Old Stephen is told in the book, The Secret History of the English Renaissance. The book is published by Simon & Schuster, Inc., at a cost of £16.99.

The dinner was a great success, but there was no love lost between Lowes-Parlby and Mr. Sandeman. They were both clever, both comparatively young, each a little suspect and jealous of the other. It is difficult to ascribe the real reason of their mutual animosity, but on the several occasions when they had met there had invariably passed a certain sardonic by-play. Mr Sandeman was said in some quarters that Mr Vermeer was jealous of him. The dinner was also attended by Sir Henry and Lady Breyd, and Stephen Garrit.. Mr. Sandeman had dined well, and he was in the mood to dazzle with a display of his varied knowledge and experiences. The conversation drifted from a discussion of the rival claims of great cities to the slow, inevitable removal of old landmarks. Lowes-Parlby changed the subject abruptly. ""Talking of landmarks,"" he said, ""we had a queer point arise in that Aztec Street inquiry. The original dispute arose owing to a discussion between a crowd of people in a pub as to where Wych Street was."" Lord Vermeer. ""A perfectly absurd discussion,"" said Lord VerMeer.. ""I have a perfectly clear recollection of Wych Street. When I was a student I used to visit there to buy books"" ""It ran parallel to New Oxford Street on the south side, just between it and Lincoln's Inn Fields"" ""Why, I should have thought that any man over forty would remember exactly where it was"" ""I know my Paris, and Vienna, and Lisbon, every brick and stone, but I look upon London as my home. I know my London even better."" ""I'm sorry, my lord. I'm so sorry."" ""It's just that I don't know where it is."". ""Wych Street"" was a little further east of what is now the Gaiety Theatre. It used to run by the side of the old Globe Theatre, parallel to the Strand. Lowes-Parlby turned on Mr. Sandeman and said: ""Oh, nonsense! You may know something about these—eastern cities; you certainly know nothing about London if you make a statement like that"" ""Wycle Street"" is now a street in central London, running parallel to The Strand and the Globe. The whole thing was so absurd—so utterly undignified. He gulped down half a glass of port and muttered just above a whisper: ""Damned impudence!"" Then, in the rudest manner he could display, he turned his back deliberately on Sandeman and walked out of the room. To the devil with Sandeman! But what would his future father-in-law think? He had never before given way to any show of ill-temper before him. He forced himself into a mood of rather fatuous jocularity. They would have lots of fun together in the days to come.. Lowes-Parlby was in the library of the Sandeman when the door opened. Adela was laughing, and discussing which was the most honourable position for the great Sandeman to occupy. He smiled confidently at Adela, and said: ""Why, of course; with pleasure"" The door opened again, and a messenger came in. Lowes-parlby turned again to his inamorata. ""Excuse me, sir. His lordship says will you kindly go and see him in theLibrary?"" ""Why yes, with pleasure,"" Adela replied.. ""What the devil have you done?"" Lord Vermeer asked. ""Sandeman has gone,"" the servant replied. ""By God, I should think you might be sorry! You insulted him. My prospective son-in-law insulted him in my own house!"" ""I'm awfully sorry. I didn't realize,"" said the servant. ""I didn't. realize!"" said the Lord. ""You insulted him! In my own home!"" said Lord VerMeer. ""Oh, I'm sorry."". ""Listen to me. Do you know that the government were on the verge of concluding a most far-reaching treaty with that man?"" ""Your insult was a most intolerable piece of effrontery, not only to him, but to me."" ""Bakkan is one of the most vulnerable outposts of the Empire. It is a terrible danger-zone"" ""Before we know where we are, the whole East will be in a blaze"" ""This contract we were negotiating would have countered this outward thrust"". ""I really can't see, sir, how I should know all this,"" Lowes-Parlby said. ""You insulted him about the merest quibble—in my house!"" ""I don't want your sorrow. I want something more practical."" ""What's that, sir?"" ""You will drive straight to Mr. Sandeman's, find him, and apologize"" ""I'm very sorry,"" he replied. ""I didn't mean to offend you."" ""I know you don't,"" he said, ""but I'm sorry."". Lord Vermeer gave Lowes-Parlby until midday to-day to apologize. If he didn't, he would hound him out of his profession. Lowes' instinct was to apologize, but he was outraged by the triviality of the matter. He drove back to his flat at Knightsbridge, thinking about his actions. He had to think before acting. Any apologizing that was done should be done after a night's reflection. The fundamental purposes of his being were to be tested. He was at a great crossing. He knew that. Some deep instinct within him was grossly outraged. Is it that a point comes when success demands that a man shall sell his soul?. Lowes-Parlby sat before the fire thinking. Would Adela be—just the right woman? In very truth, did he really love Adela? Or was it all—a rag? Was life a rag—a game played by lawyers, politicians, and people? It was past midnight when he suddenly muttered a low ""Damn!"" and walked to the bureau. He took up a pen and wrote: ""Dear Mr. Lowes, I love you very much. I am so sorry for what has happened to you. I hope you will forgive me for it. I will always love you."". ""I must apologize for acting so rudely to you last night. It was quite unpardonable of me"" ""I can't think how I made the mistake. Please forgive me."" ""Yours cordially, Francis Lowes-Parlby"" ""It's all positively absurd!"" ""It was quite right about the position of Wych Street"" ""You were quite right,"" said the man. ""I'm very sorry about it."" ""I am very sorry,"" replied the man, ""but it was quite correct"". ""I'm not sure I'm ready to go home,"" he says. ""I'm so tired. I've been up all night. I want to go back to bed"" He's not alone. He's in bed with his wife. She's asleep. He is in bed. He can't get out. He says he's not ready to leave. He wants to stay. But he can't. He has to go. He must go home. He'll go back. He will go back and get his wife, he says, but he won't be able to. He won't get her back.. ""I have seen lives lost, ruin brought about, endless suffering,"" he says. ""I have been impressed, very impressed indeed"" ""I've seen a young man's brilliant career almost shattered,"" he adds. ""Only last week, a young boy's life was almost destroyed"" ""Even in my own field of—limited observation—the opinion of an outsider, you may say—so often it happens,"" he writes. ""So often, it happens—the trouble caused by an affirmation without sufficiently established data"". The Lord Chief justice grunted. He put the nuts back on the dish, and then, in an apparently irrelevant manner, he said abruptly: ""Do you remember Wych Street, my lord?"" He took a pencil from his pocket and sketched a plan on the tablecloth. After all, why argue with the law? The law wa. The law was there to be followed."

But he liked to go with his grandfather to the stone-yard. While the old man was busy, he would play among the chips. Sometimes he would make a little statue of soft clay; sometimes he would take hammer and chisel, and try to cut a statue from a piece of rock.. The story of a young boy who became a stone-cutter is told in the novel ""The Little Engine That Could"" The boy, named Antonio, was born into a poor family but grew up to become a well-known and talented artist. The story of Antonio's life is told by his grandson, who is called ""The Great"" and is called a ""sculp-tor"" by his family. The boy's story is told through the eyes of Antonio, who tells it to his grandson's friends. The tale is said to have been inspired by the story of the Little Engine that Could, and the story is believed to be based on a true story.. The boy could not cook, and he was not old enough to wait on the table; but he could wash the pans and kettles, and as he was smart and quick, he could help in many other ways. Then there was a crash in the dining room, and a man rushed into the kitchen with some pieces of marble in his hands. He was pale, and trembling with fright. ""I have broken the statue that was to stand at the center of the table. I cannot make the table look pretty without the statue. What will the Count say?"". Antonio Ca-no-va left his pans and kettles, and went up to the man who had caused the trouble. ""If you had another statue, could you arrange the table?"" he asked. ""Cer-tain-ly,"" said the man; ""that is, if the statue were of the right length and height."" ""Will you let me try to make one?"" asked Anto-nio. ""Perhaps I can make something that will do,"" he said.. Two hundred pounds the lump weighed, and it had just come in, fresh and clean, from the dairy on the mountain. With a kitchen knife in his hand, Antonio began to cut and carve this butter. In a few minutes he had molded it into the shape of a crouching lion; and all the servants crowded around to see it. ""How beautiful!"" they cried. ""It is a great deal pret-ti-er than the statue that was broken."". ""Truly, my friends,"" he said, ""this is as much of a surprise to me as to you.""

""My name is Antonio Canova,"" said he, ""and I have had no teacher but my grandfather the stonecutter"" ""How odd that he should choose to make it of butter!"" asked the Count's friends. ""None but a very great artist could ever carve such a figure,"" they said. ""And how odd that they should have chosen butter!"" they added.. The best artists in the land were impressed with his work. They invited him to a dinner. He became known as one of the greatest sculptors in the world. He died in 1875.

Dick saw the wagon standing by the inn, and he thought that it must be going to the fine city of London. The driver asked him some questions; and when he learned how poor Dick was, and that he had neither father nor mother, he told him that he might do as he liked. Dick ran as fast as he could, from one street to another, trying to find those that were paved with gold.. Dick was so hungry that he began to ask those whom he met to give him a penny to buy something to eat. ""Go to work, you idle fellow,"" said some of them; and the rest passed him by without even looking at him. Dick grew so faint and tired that he could go no farther.

He is also said to be a great lover of the arts. He wrote a book about his life. The book is called ""The Monk and the Queen of Amboise"" and is published by Macmillan, London, 1962. The author is also the author of ""The Art of Painting,"" published by Harper's Magazine, London.. The monk was at this time a man whose qualities had grown rapidly. He was a great favourite with the ladies, who crammed him with wine, confectioneries, and dainty dishes. He rendered himself so obnoxious to Louis the Eleventh, that that monarch seriously commanded his provost-royal to remove him from his sight. It has been related in the first volume of these Tales, how the monk was saved through the mistake of Sieur Tristan. The monk's story is told in the second volume of this series of Tales. The first volume, published in 1805, is called The Monk of Turpenay. The second volume, released in 1815, is entitled The Monk's Story. The third and final volume of the Tales, published in 1815 and 1816, is known as The Monks. ""The ladies can laugh without blushing, or blush without laughing, as it suits them best,"" says the king. ""The old courtiers, of course, understood,"" he adds. ""They stood, by the ladies' permission, beside their chairs, to laugh at the same time as they did"" The king's story is told in a book called ""The King's Story,"" published in 17th century England. The book was written by the king's son-in-law, who later became king himself.. The Abbot of Turpenay tells the story of the two popes at Rome. He says that they granted titles and rights to each adherent, which made double owners everywhere. The monasteries and abbeys that were at war with their neighbours would not recognise both the popes, and found themselves much embarrassed by the other. The Abbot always gave the verdict to the enemies of the Chapter, who always gave it to the enemy of the Monasteries. The story is told in a low, soft, flute-like voice.. The abbey of Turpenay had a heavy trial on concerning the settlements of certain rights with the redoubtable Sire de Cande, an idolatrous infidel. This wicked schism brought about considerable mischief, and proved abundantly that error is worse in Christianity than the adultery of the Church. This devil, sent upon earth in the shape of a nobleman, was, to tell the truth, a good soldier, well received at court, and a friend of the Sieur Bureau de la Riviere. He was a person to whom the king was exceedingly partial--King Charles the Fifth, of glorious memory. You may be sure that his neighbours were terribly afraid of him, and to save their skulls let him have his way. He did exactly as he pleased in the valley of the Indre, where he used to be. The Pope was well pleased at the ecclesiastical schism, and waited for the decision of our abbey, concerning which pope they should choose, to pillage them. He was quite ready to recognise the one to whom the abbot of Turpenay should refuse his obedience. He would, however, have preferred him under the ground to above it, and heartily wished him bad luck. In the whole valley the noble abbey alone showed fight to this demon, for it has always been a doctrine of the Church to take into her lap the weak and suffering, and use every effort to protect the oppressed.. The abbot, to whom at that time, the care of our glorious abbey was committed, led a most holy life, and prayed to God with devotion. But he would have saved his own soul ten times, of such good quality was his religion, before finding a chance to save the abbey itself from the clutches of this wretch. Now you see of what stuff this horrid man was made. The abbot's gown floated him on the Indre, and he made his way comfortably to the other side, which he attained in full view of the lord of Cande, who was not ashamed to enjoy the terrors of a servant of God. The lord was a good man, but he would not have been able to save his own life from the abbot.. Agnusius of Tarsus was a monk at the beginning of the reign of St. Paul. He was a follower of the false god Aegipan, and was a friend of the Pope. He said that God was disgusted with His creation, and would have nothing more to do with it. He also said that the trumpets of Jericho were no longer made in any portion of the world. The Pope was so upset by this that he ordered that all the oxen in the province would have to be yoked to the chariot of Providence. The chariot came in time, but not in time for the Pope to get it in time to save the day. The pope was so angry that he had to order that the oxes were yoked in the first place, and that the king's chariot had to be made.. ""He was like him, strong in the stomach, had crooked legs, arms hairy as those of a saddler, a back made to carry a wallet, a face as red as the phiz of a drunkard, glistening eyes, a tangled beard, was hairy faced, and so puffed out with fat and meat that you would have fancied him in an interesting condition. He was as fond of his bed as a beggar with sores, and would go about the valley fuddling, faddling, blessing the bridals, pl. Amador was a member of the ecclesiastical militia. He was a pilferer, a loiterer, and a bad soldier. He claimed to have enough fat to feed a dwarf. He set off across the country, heedless of the cruelty and ill-treatment of the Sieur de Cande, saying that he had that within his gown which would subdue him. He went his way with nothing but the said gown for his viaticum, but then in it was enough fat for a dwarf to feed him. The Sieur of Cande was a man of the militia, who was a prisoner of the abbey. He said to the abbot that he would attempt to save the ab Abbey. The abbot agreed to postpone the case if he succeeded in putting an end to it.. Amador was sent to Tours by the abbot of Cande. He entered the chateau during a heavy rainstorm. A servant took pity on him and told him to make himself scarce. Amador was then asked what made him so bold as to enter a house where monks were hated more than a red leper. He replied: ""I am on my way to Tours, sent thither by my lord abbot"" Amador later died in Tours, France, in 1235. He was buried in the town of Tours. He is buried in a mausoleum, near the town's cathedral, in the village of Amadour-sur-Tour. He died in 1236.. The servant reported these words to his master, who at first wished to have the monk thrown into the big trough of the castle among the other filth. But the lady of Cande, who had great authority over her spouse, and was respected by him, reprimanded him, saying, that it was possible this monk was a Christian. I hope that he will find mercy in his hour of need,"" he said. The monk was taken to Turpenay, where he remained until the end of the year. The abbey was later dissolved. The monastery was later taken over by the town of Cando. The monks were later taken to the town's castle, where they remained until 12th century. The church was later absorbed by the city of Turpenays, and the monks were eventually driven from the castle. The town was later abandoned.. The story is based on the life of Amador, a monk at a chateau in France. The monk was forced to work in the rain. The story is told by a maid, Perrotte, who hated monks. The wench told the story to her master, the lord of the chateaux, who had secret relations with his wife's maid, to put an end to his ill-will towards the luckless Amador. The plot worked and the monk was made to work under the pigsty. The tale is told in a book called ""The Monk's Wife"" by Jean-Michel Basquiat.. Amador received on the nose, cheeks, and other portions of his face a slash of the whip, which made him see all the lights of the Magnificat. The Sieur de Cande, busy chastening his greyhounds pretended not see the monk. He requested Amador to pardon him this accident, and ran after the dogs who had caused the mischief to his guest. Amador said: ""I thank the lady and lord, not for their hospitality which is a Christian thing, but for having sent as an ambassador to me, a poor sinner, an angel of such delicate beauty that I fancy I see the Virgin over our altar"" He then asked the lady of the house to step in, and said: ""I invite you in his name and that of the Lady of the House to step into."". The monk remained in the draught between the door and the window until the moment when the Sieur de Cande, his wife, and his aged sister, came and sat in their chairs at the head of the table. Not one made room for the man of God. The monk suspected the relations of Perrotte and the chevalier, concerning whom it is possible that the lasses of the valley had already whispered something into his ear. The Sieur of Cande let him sit at the extreme end of thetable, in a corner, where two mischievous lads had orders to squeeze and elbow him. He was not allowed to leave the room until he had finished.. The monk was forced to drink seven large jugfuls of white wine without making belch, break wind, sweat or snort. The varlet who served a caudle baptised his head with it, and took care to let the burning liquor trickle down poor Amador's backbone. All this agony he endured with meekness, because the spirit of God was in him, and also the hope of finishing the litigation by holding out in the castle. Nevertheless, the mischievous lot burst out into such roars of laughter at the warm baptism given by the cook's lad to the soaked monk, even the butler making jokes at his expense. Even the lady of Cande was compelled to notice what was going on at the end of the table. The monk was eventually rescued by a group of men from the town, and taken to the castle, where he was taken prisoner. The story of the. ""Truly,"" said she to herself, ""God has put great strength into this monk!"" said the old lady. ""Truly"" she said, "" God has putgreat strength in this monk"" The monk, perceiving that the. old lady and her charge, the lady and the servants had seen him manoeuvring the bone, pushed backed his. sleeve, showed the powerful muscles of his arm, placed nuts near his wrist on the bifurcation of. the veins, and crushed them one by one by pressing them with the palm of his hand so vigorously that they appeared. like ripe medlars. The old lady forbade the pages, servants, and others to torment the poor man, to whom out of mockery they had just given some rotten apples and maggoty nuts.. The monk crushed the seeds between his fingers and cut them in two. He also crunched them between his teeth, white as the teeth of a dog, husk, shell, fruit, and all. He made in a second a mash which he swallowed like honey. Everyone declared that the monk was a man capable of throwing the castle into the moat. The women were silent, that the men believed the devil to be in the monk. The monk was taken to a wretched little closet where Perrotte had arranged her machine in order to annoy him during the night. He was then imprisoned in the closet where he was kept in the dark. The woman had arranged the machine to annoy the monk during the day.. The tom-cats of the neighbourhood had been requested to come and confess to him, invited to tell him their sins in embryo towards the tabbies who attracted their affections. The little pigs for whom fine lumps of tripe had been placed under the bed in order to prevent them becoming monks, were very desirous. At every movement of poor Amador, who would find short horse- hair in the sheets, he would bring down cold water on to the bed, and a thousand other tricks were arranged. Everyone went to bed in expectation of the nocturnal revels of the monk, certain that they would not be disappointed, since he had been lodged under the tiles at the top of a little tower.. The Sire came to stay with his dear Perrotte, who slept in the next room. Amador drew from his bag a knife, and dexterously extricated himself. Then he began to listen in order to find out the ways of the place. He heard the master of the house laughing with his maid-servant. Suspecting their manoeuvres, he waited till the moment when the lady of the House should be alone in bed, and made his way into her room with bare feet. He appeared to her by the light of the lamp in the manner in which monks generally appear during the night--that is, in a marvellous state, which the laity find it difficult to sustain.. ""Know, madame, that I am sent by Jesus and the Virgin Mary to warn you to put an end to the improper perversities which are taking place,"" he said. ""If you speak truly, my father, I will submit to your guidance,"" said she, springing lightly out of bed. ""You will find them all amassed in our Holy Church, which is the consolation of the afflicted,"" he continued. ""Behold in me the messenger, ready to pay these debts if you do not renounce them."" ""What is the use of being a lady if the seigneurial dues are received elsewhere?"" she asked. ""According to this, your servant is the lady and you are the servant,"" he replied. ""Are not all the joys bestowed upon her due to you?"". ""You are for sure, a messenger of God, because you have been in a single day that which I had not noticed here for a long time,"" said the monk. ""Avenge me quickly, then, my father,"" said she, ""that I may begin to cry out."" ""Thereupon the monk avenged her most monastically with a good and ample vengeance, that she indulged in as a drunkard who puts his lips to the bunghole of a barrel,"" said Amador. ""When a lady avenges herself, she should get drunk with vengeance, or not taste it at all,"" said a later version of the story. ""You are a messenger for God,"" said one of the monks. ""I have seen you in a day, and I have seen your face, and you have seen mine."". The chatelaine was revenged to that degree that she could not move; since nothing agitates, takes away the breath, and exhausts, like anger and vengeance. Amador promised to aid her in it as long as her ire lasted. He pointed out to her canonically what a Christian thing it is to revenge oneself, because all through the Holy Scriptures God declares Himself, above all things, to be a God of vengeance. And moreover, demonstrates to us, by his establishment in the infernal regions, how royally divine a thing vengeance is, since His vengeance is eternal. But although she were avenged, and doubly and trebly revenged, yet would she not forgive, in order that she might reserve the right of avenging. The chatelaine confessed that she had never understood the commandments of the Church, and invited her well- beloved monk to enlighten her thoroughly concerning them. The sight that met her eyes displeased the lady beyond the power of words to express, as it appeared by her discourse, of which to roughness was similar to that of the water of a big pond when the sluice-gates were opened. From which it followed, that women with monks ought to revenge themselves, under pain of not being Christians and faithful servants of celestial doctrines, and that they should not be taken in flagrant delectation. The lady, who had been excited by the vengeance which had refreshed them, went into the room where the jade was amusing herself, and by chance found her.. ""Out upon virtue! my lord; I've had my share of it. You have shown me that religion in conjugal faith is an abuse"" ""How many children have you consigned to this common oven, this poor-box, this bottomless alms-purse, this leper's porringer, the true cemetery of the House of Cande?"" ""I will have handsome cavaliers, in order that I may have an heir"" ""I have no son.. ""I will shout, and shout to make myself heard, heard by the archbishop,"" said the lady. ""I will have sewn up in a sack, and thrown into the Indre,"" replied the lord. ""Do not dishonour your husband!"" said the lord, ""I the legitimate children."" ""You can get the bastards, I the legitimate kids,"" replied his wife.. ""Silence, madame!"" said the sire, as shamefaced as a blind man's dog. ""I have been too grossly outraged,"" said the lady of Cande. ""This is the reason that certain women govern their husbands, because mind is the master of matter"" ""I will not be silent. Hi! there,"" she called out. ""Hi! there!"" said he. ""What is your name?"" she asked. ""The king."" ""The abbot."" ""I am the abbot,"" he said. ""And I am the king of the kingdom of Cand. ""Am I too hallowed for you to touch? Am I a holy shrine? Was there need of a papal brief to kiss me? God's truth! have you had so much of me that you are tired?"" ""Do charming wenches know more than ladies? Ha! perhaps it is so, since she has let you work in the field without sowing"" ""Thank God! I am quit of you and your whims, because I intend to retire to a monastery"" ""I will practice it with those whom I take into my service, for it is settled that I am free. That is as we should be"" ""Your society was wearisome, and the little pleasure I derived from it cost me too dear"" ""You are a man of the world, and I am one of the people of the earth."". ""Abandon your anger, my daughter,"" said the monk. ""It is commanded us by the Church to forgive those who trespass against us"" ""To begin with, I shall have this trollop thrown into the river, sewn up in a sack, for having diverted the seed of the House of Cande from its proper channel,"" said Amador. ""For the rest I will--"" said the daughter. ""I shall be more comfortable in this monastery with my daughter, than in this place of abominable wickedness"" ""You can inherit from your wench. Ha, ha! The fine lady of Cando! Look at her!"" said the avenging monk, appearing suddenly upon the scene.. The monk took the hand of the sire, placed it in that of the lady, and added -- ""Go and talk over the pardon"" Then he whispered into the husband's ears this sage advice: ""My lord, use your best argument, and you will silence her with it"" ""Pardon your maid-servant, who will pray heaven for you. Thus God, supplicated by all, will have you in His keeping, and will bless you with male lineage for this pardon"" ""To pardon is a most holy work. From that comes the jubilee, which is a day of great rejoicing, because all debts and offences are forgiven. Thus it is a source of happiness to pardon"". ""By the body of the Jupiter! There's good in this monk after all,"" said the seigneur, as he went out. ""You are to blame, my dear, for having wished to torment a poor servant of God,"" said Amador. ""Argue continually, and thus you will always have the upper hand of your wife,"" he added. ""I will not let you go without a fight,"" replied Amador, ""and I will win."" ""I am not afraid of a fight. I am afraid of nothing,"" replied Perrotte, ""but I will not give in to it."" ""You will not be able to do anything to me,"" replied the monk, ""because I have. The monk told the young Demoiselle de Cande that he could grant her an indulgence. The young lady was so pleased with this relic that her brain became muddled and she indulged as devoutly in indulgences as the Lady of Cande had indulged in vengeances. But, remember, this pleasure was due to him for the trouble he had taken. The monk had hoped for this occurrence, since his mouth had watered at the sight of this fair blossom, whom he also confessed, because the elder lady could not hinder him from bestowing upon the younger one, who wished it, what remained of the indulgence. But he was not so lucky. The younger Demoiselles was not as fortunate. She was not able to indulge in the same way as her older sister.. The servants all believed the monk to be a devil who had carried off the cats, the pigs, and also their masters. Every one slept, thanks to the monk, so long, that no one in the castle was up before noon, which was the dinner hour. ""Come, my father,"" said the chatelaine, giving her arm to the Monk, whom she put at her side in the baron's chair. ""The Sire of Cande said not a word,"" replied the Sire, ""because the monk was at my side."" ""The monk was in the room at meal time,"" said the. ""Fill up Father Amador's goblet,"" said the sire. ""Father Amador has no bread,"" said a little lady. ""Page, give some of this to Father Amadore,"" said madame. ""What do you require, Father Am"

She had just been looking at that daring speculator ""working with his hyena"" ""You think that beasts are wholly without passions?"" I asked her. ""Quite the reverse; we can communicate to them all the vices. ""He had one of those intrepid heads, stamped with the seal of warfare, and on which the battles of Napoleon are written,"" says the author. ""He would not hesitate to make friends with the devil himself,"" he adds. ""When I was expatiating on the courage of M. Martin, he smiled, shook his head knowingly. ""The Frenchman in Egypt"" is an epic which one might call ""The Frenchman In Egypt"" During the expedition in Upper Egypt under General Desaix, a Provenal soldier fell into the hands of the Mangrabins, and was taken by these Arabs into the deserts beyond the falls of the Nile. The Mangrabin's camped round a well overshadowed by palm trees under which they. Frenchman was captured by a group of men in the desert. They tied his hands and left him to die in the sand. He escaped and set out to find the French army. He was killed by his own horse after lashing it with his spurs. The story is told in the novel, The Thief, by Jean-Paul Sartre.. ""In spite of the beauty of an Oriental sky at night, he felt he had not strength enough to go on. Fortunately he had been able to find a small hill, on the summit of which a few palm trees shot up into the air"" He repented having left the mangrabins, whose nomad life seemed to smile on him.. The silence was awful in its wild and terrible majesty. Infinity, immensity, closed in upon the soul from every side. The sky was lit with an Oriental splendor of insupportable purity, leaving naught for the imagination to desire. Heaven and earth were on fire.. The Provenal threw his arms around the trunk of one of the palm trees, as though it were the body of a friend, and then in the shelter of the thin straight shadow that the palm cast upon the granite, he wept. He cried aloud, to measure the solitude.. The Provenal was twenty-two years old; he loaded his carbine. He hoped to live long enough to await the passing of some Arabs, or perhaps he might hear the sound of cannon. At this time Bonaparte was traversing Egypt. The instinct which binds us to life awoke again in his heart. This thought gave him new life.. The author cut down one of the palm trees that had served him for shelter the night before. He was unable to cut the palm in pieces, though he succeeded in cutting it down in pieces. The author put a barrier at the entrance of his house to prevent the animals from coming to drink.. The story is about a soldier who fell asleep in the desert. He heard a noise and saw two faint yellow lights in the darkness. The soldier was terrified. He tore off the leaves of a tree and used them to mend the mat on which he was to sleep. The story is told in the book The King of the desert by Toni Morrison.. The Provenal was not educated enough to know under what species his enemy ought to be classed. He endured a cruel torture, noting every variation of the breathing close to him without daring to make the slightest movement.. The lion of Egypt slept, curled up like a big dog, the peaceful possessor of a sumptuous niche at the gate of a hotel. Its eyes opened for a moment and closed again; its face was turned toward the man. A thousand confused thoughts passed through the Frenchman's mind.. ""She's had a good dinner,"" he thought, without troubling himself as to whether her feast might have been on human flesh. ""She won't be hungry when she gets up,"" he added. ""I'm sure she'll be hungry again,"" he said.. The panther's fur on her belly and flanks was glistening white. Many small marks like velvet formed beautiful bracelets round her feet. Her. The Provenal would doubtless have admired the grace of the animal, and the vigorous contrasts of vivid color which gave her robe an imperial splendor. But just then his sight was troubled by her sinister appearance. The presence of the panther, even asleep, could not fail to produce the effect which the magnetic eyes. ""The day before yesterday the Arabs would have killed me perhaps,"" he said. Like men driven to bay who defy death and offer their body to the smiter, so he, seeing in this merely a tragic episode, resolved to play his part with honor to the last. ""All right, make a little toilet,"" the Frenchman said to himself, beginning to recover his gaiety with his. The rigidity of her metallic eyes and their insupportable luster made him shudder, especially when the animal walked toward him. But he looked at her caressingly, staring into her eyes in order to magnetize her, and let her come quite close to him. Then with a movement both gentle and amorous, he passed his hand over her whole body.. The panther let him go out, but when he reached the summit of the hill she sprang with the lightness of a sparrow hopping from tw. The sultana of the desert showed herself gracious to her slave. She lifted her head, stretched out her and manifested her delight by - the tranquility of her attitude. It suddenly occurred to the soldier that to kill this savage princess with one blow he must poignard her in the throat.. The Provenal ate his dates, leaning against one of the palm trees, and casting his eyes alternately on the desert in quest of some liberator and on his terrible companion to watch her uncertain clemency. The panther looked at the place where the date stones fell, and every time that he threw one down her eyes expressed an incredible mistrust.. The soldier tried if he might walk up and down, and the panther left him free. The cold cruelty of a tiger was dominant, it was true, but there was also a vague resemblance to the face of a sensual woman. The face of this solitary queen had something of the gaiety of. The man, keeping the dagger in one hand, thought to plunge it into the belly of the too-confiding panther, but he was afraid that he would be immediately strangled in her last conclusive struggle. The first piece of good luck emboldened him to tempt the future, and he conceived the wild hope of continuing on good terms with the panther.. The soldier thought of his first sweetheart, whom he had nicknamed ""Mignonne"" by way of contrast, because she was so atrociously jealous. At the setting of the sun Mignonne gave, several times running, a profound melancholy cry. The soldier noticed what a pacific attitude his companion remained in. ""She's been well brought up,"". The soldier waited with impatience the hour of his flight, and when it had arrived he walked vigorously in the direction of the Nile. But hardly had he made a quarter of a league in the sand when he heard the panther bounding after him.. The soldier was caught by a panther in the desert. The panther's ferocity was rendered gentle by the man. The soldier could not explain to himself the reason for their strange friendship. He slept and awoke to find Mignonne waiting for him. She received the wonted caress of her companion.. ""Don't you take to eating Frenchmen, or I shan't like you any longer,"" said the Provenal. ""You are a nice girl, aren't you? Just look at that! So we like to be made much of, don. The Provenal's life was filled with contrast and his life began to be diversified. He discovered in the rising and setting of the sun sights unknown to the world. He knew what it was to tremble when he heard over his head the hiss of a bird's wing, so rarely did they pass. He studied in the night time the effect of the moon upon the ocean of sand.. At last he grew passionately fond of the panther; for some sort of affection was a necessity. He passed whole hours in remembering mere nothings, and comparing his present life with his past. He had sacrificed his shirt to make a flag with, which he hung at the top of a palm tree.. Mignonne was not angry when he took hold of the tuft at the end of her tail to count her rings. It gave him pleasure to contemplate the supple, fine outlines of her form, the whiteness of her belly, the graceful pose of her head. The agility and youthful lightness of her movements were a continual surprise.. ""It's horribly difficult, but you will understand, after what the old villain told me over his champagne,"" says the author. ""I don't know if I hurt her, but she turned round, as if enraged, and with her sharp teeth caught hold of my leg,"" he adds. ""She rolled over, giving a cry that froze my heart; and. ""It was as though I had murdered a real person,"" he said. ""I've certainly carried my carcass about a good deal, but never have I seen anything like the desert. Ah! yes, it is very beautiful!"""
0.64,0.74,54.58902893662347,"The house was crowned by a triangular roof of which no example will, ere long, be seen in Paris. The roof projected three feet over the roadway, as much to protect the threshold from the rainfall as to shelter the wall of a loft and its sill-less dormer-window. It was evident that every beam quivered in its mortices at the passing of the lightest vehicle. The walls of this tumbledown abode seemed to have been decorated with hieroglyphics.. The house was built of planks, overlapping each other like slates, in order, no doubt, not to overweight the frail house. On the first floor four tall, narrow windows, close together, were filled as to the lower panes with boards. The windows of the second floor, where the Venetian blinds were drawn up, revealing little dingy muslin curtains behind the large Bohemian glass panes, did not interest him either. The young man seemed very scornful of this part of the house; his eyes had not yet rested on it. He was studying it with the enthusiasm of an antiquary.. The shop was built in the 19th century and is located in the centre of Paris. The shop is located on the Rue de Rivoli, near the Champs-Elysees and the Chateau de Versailles. It is currently owned by a family who live in the nearby town of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The owner of the shop, a young man, has lived in the shop for some time. He has visited the shop several times and has been amused by some of the details of the building. He says that the shop is a good example of the work of French carpentry, but that the details are laughable.. The cat held in one of its forepaws a racket as big as itself, and stood on its hind legs to aim at hitting an enormous ball, returned by a man in a fine embroidered coat. Drawing, color, and accessories, all were treated in such a way as to suggest that the artist had meant to make game of the shop-owner and of the passing observer. Time, while impairing this artless painting, had made it yet more grotesque by introducing some uncertain features which must have puzzled the. The Spinning Sow, the Green Monkey, and others, were animals in cages whose skills astonished the passer-by, and whose accomplishments prove the patience of the fifteenth-century artisan. To the right of the picture, on an azure field which ill-disguised the decay of the wood, might be read the name ""Guillaume,"" and to the left, ""Successor to Master Chevrel"" Sun and rain had worn away most of the gilding parsimoniously applied to the letters of this superscription. The stranger was certainly not standing there to admire the cat, which a minute's attention sufficed to stamp on his memory. Such curiosities did more to enrich their fortunate owners than the signs of ""Providence,"" ""Good-faith,"" ""Grace of God,"" and ""Decapitation of John the Baptist,"" which may still be. A young man in a white cravat and white gloves walked through the streets of Paris. He was dressed a la Caracalla, a fashion introduced as much by David's school of painting as by the mania for Greek and Roman styles which characterized the early years of this century. He must have seemed as curious to the shopkeeping folk of the ""Cat and Racket"" as the "" cat and racket"" was to him. He had just come, no doubt, from a wedding or a ball; for at this early hour he had in his hand a pair of white gloves.. The stranger's forehead had a stamp of doom. The fire that flashed in his black eyes, gloomy and sparkling by turns, was in harmony with the singular outline of his features. When the stranger's brow expressed passion the furrows formed in it were terrible in their strength and energy. But when he recovered his calmness, so easily upset, it beamed with a luminous grace which gave great attractiveness to a countenance in which joy, grief, love, anger, or scorn blazed out so contagiously that the coldest man could not fail to be impressed. He was so thoroughly vexed by the time when the dormer-window of the loft was. The poet's story is about a group of young men in London. The men were playing a game of charades with a man they called a ""lover"" The men had been waiting for the man to come out of his room to play with them. The lads were delighted to see him come out with a fine white shower of hair. The man's face showed his contempt for the lads' efforts. The story is told in the book ""The Lads' Game of Lads"" by William Shakespeare. The book is published by P.S. Cottesloe, £3.99, with p&p.. The girl's face was as fresh as one of the white cups that bloom on the bosom of the waters. Though wrapped in brown stuff, her neck and shoulders gleamed here and there through little openings left by her movements in sleep. No expression of embarrassment detracted from the candor of her face, or the calm look of eyes immortalized long since in the sublime works of Raphael. There was a delightful contrast between the cheeks of that face on which sleep had, as it were, given high relief to a superabundance of life, and the antiquity of the heavy window with its clumsy shape and black sill. Like those day-blowing flowers, which in the early morning have not yet unfurled their cups,. The ""Cat and Racket"" was a shop in Paris, owned by a man named Guillaume. The shop was closed when a woman was seen in undress in the shop. The man who opened the door was a man-servant with a sign saying ""Guillaume, successor to Chevrel"" The shop's shutters were removed by magic, leaving the shop empty. The door was then opened by a woman, who was apparently distressed at being seen in unclothed state. The sash of the shop fell, and the shop was destroyed by the fall of the sash.. Monsieur Guillaume was a merchant clothier in Paris. His connections were the most extensive. He was always ready to deliver the required quantity of cloth. He knew a thousand ways of extracting the largest profits. He would mention his notary as an accommodating man, and managed to get a second profit out of the bargain. It was a proverb among the traders of the Rue Saint-Denis: ""Heaven preserve you from Monsieur Guillaume's notary!"" to signify a heavy discount. The old merchant was to be seen standing on the threshold of his shop, as if by a miracle, the instant the servant withdrew.. Monsieur Guillaume wore loose black velvet breeches, pepper-and-salt stockings, and square toed shoes with silver buckles. His gray hair was so accurately combed and flattened over his yellow pate that it made it look like a furrowed field. His little green eyes, that might have been pierced with a gimlet, flashed beneath arches faintly tinged with red in the place of eyebrows. Anxieties had wrinkled his forehead with as many horizontal lines as there were creases in his coat.. The head of the Guillaume family was a notable upholder of ancient practices. He might be heard to regret the Provost of Merchants, and never did he mention a decision of the Tribunal of Commerce without calling it the Sentence of the Consuls. This colorless face expressed patience, commercial shrewdness, and the sort of wily cupidity which is needful in business. At that time these old families were less rare than they are now, in which the characteristic habits and costume of their calling, surviving in the midst of more recent civilization, were preserved.. The stranger looked at the clothier's cashier's corner. Monsieur Guillaume naturally thought that this sinister personage had an eye to the till of the Cat and Racket. So much affection for his dwelling seemed suspicious to a trader who had lived long enough to remember the law of maximum prices. But at this moment the old clothier paid no heed to his apprentices. He was absorbed in trying to divine the motive of the anxious looks which the young man in silk stockings and a cloak cast alternately at his signboard and into the depths of his shop.. Monsieur Guillaume was playing a practical joke on his three apprentices. One of the apprentices was watching the windows of the third floor. The draper and his amorous apprentice were suddenly relieved from the fears which the young man's presence had excited in their minds. ""Well, gentlemen, what ails you that you are standing there with your arms folded?"" said Monsieur Guillaume to his three neophytes. ""What is it that makes you stand there?"" asked the draper. ""It's just that I want to see you,"" said the amorous apprentices.. Guillaume regarded it as his duty to keep them under the rod of an old-world despotism. He made them work like Negroes. These three assistants were equal to a business which would harry ten such clerks as those whose sybaritical tastes now swell the columns of the budget. Not a sound disturbed the peace of this solemn house, where the hinges were always oiled, and where the meanest article of furniture showed the respectable cleanliness which reveals strict order and economy. The old shopkeeper could not help smiling. He was a man of the people. He had a heart of gold.. The three young men would write the date of the first appearance of the cheese on their plates. They would then leave it untouched for the rest of the meal. The boys would also write the dates of the salad and the bread they had eaten that day. They were always prepared for the meal, and would leave the cheese untouched. They also left the bread untouched for dessert, which they also left untouched. The three boys would then go to the church for the evening's service, and leave the bread and cheese untouched for them to eat. They never left the table until the meal was over.. Mesdemoiselles Virginie and Augustine, simply attired in cotton print, each took the arm of an apprentice and walked in front, under the piercing eye of their mother. The second apprentice received no salary. As for the eldest, whose twelve years of perseverance and discretion had initiated him into the secrets of the house, he was paid eight hundred francs a year as the reward of his labors. On certain family festivals he received as a gratuity. The old houses were a school of honesty and sound morals. The masters adopted their apprentices. The young man's linen was cared for, mended, and often replaced by the mistress of the house. If an apprentice fell ill, he was the object of truly maternal attention. In a case of danger the master lavished his money in calling in the most celebrated physicians, for he was not answerable to their parents merely for the good conduct and training of the lads. The master draper would have been more likely to steal a piece of cloth than to infringe this time-honored etiquette.. Guillaume had two daughters. The elder, Mademoiselle Virginie, was the very image of her mother. Joseph Lebas, the chief assistant, was an orphan without any fortune. He did not share the symmetrical ideas of his master. He would not for an empire have given his second daughter in marriage before the elder. The unhappy assistant felt that his heart was wholly given to the younger. It is necessary to inquire a little further into the springs of the absolute government which ruled the old cloth-merchant's household. The passion had grown up in secret, which had grown. up insecret.. Madame Guillaume, daughter of the Sieur Chevrel, sat so upright in the stool behind her desk, that more than once she had heard some wag bet that she was a stuffed figure. Devoid of attractions or of amiable manners, Madame Guillaumes commonly decorated her head with a cap of a particular and unvarying shape, with long lappets, like that of a widow. Her speech was curt, and her movements had the stiff precision of a semaphore. Her eye, with a gleam in it like a cat's, seemed to spite the world because she was so ugly..  Augustine was little, or, to describe her more truly, delicately made. Full of gracious candor, a man of the world could have found no fault in the charming girl. Her silent and placid face was full of the transient melancholy which comes over all young girls who are too weak to dare to resist their mother's will. The two sisters, always plainly dressed, could not gratify the innate vanity of womanhood but by a luxury of cleanliness which became them wonderfully, and made them harmonize with the polished counters and the shining shelves. As their style of living compelled them to find the elements of happiness in persistent work, Augustine and Virginie had hitherto always satisfied their mother, who secretly prided herself on the perfect. The French were brought up to a commercial life. They knew nothing of the pleasures of the world. They were as skilled in darning as in embroidery. Their mother often talked of having them taught to cook, so that they might know how to order a dinner and scold a cook with due knowledge. They very rarely suffered their eyes to wander beyond the walls of their hereditary home, which to their mother was the whole universe. They had studied nothing but grammar, book-keeping, a little Bible-history, and the history of France in Le Ragois.. When the great drawing-room on the second floor was to be prepared to receive company. The meetings to which family anniversaries gave rise filled in the future of earthly joy to them. The arrangements, made necessary by the way in which everything was packed away, made a variety in the monotonous lives of the three women, who came and went and exerted themselves as nuns would to receive their bishop. The plate, the Dresden china, the candlesticks. ""The portress nun"" allowed her daughters to play backgammon and other games in her bedroom. The girls were too tired to go to the great balls, so they stayed in the house and played. ""We have done nothing today,"" the girls would tell their mother after the games were over. ""It is better than going to the balls,"" said their mother, ""because we can play."" ""We can't play,"" said the girls, ""and it's not fun."" ""It's better than the balls, because we can't go to them,"" replied the mother.. The daughters of the Marquis de Guillaume wore dresses the shabbiness of which made them blush. Their style of dancing was not in any way remarkable, and their mother's surveillance did not allow of their holding any conversation with their partners beyond Yes and No. The law of the old sign of the Cat and Racket commanded that they should be home by eleven o'clock, the hour when balls and fetes begin to be lively. Augustine, however, had been gifted by chance with a spirit lofty enough to feel the emptiness of such a life. Her blue eyes would sometimes be raised as if to pierce the depths of that gloomy staircase and those damp store-rooms.. Augustine's expression of vague longing, her gentle voice, her jasmine skin, and her blue eyes had lighted in poor Lebas' soul a flame as ardent as it was reverent. From an easily understood caprice, Augustine felt no affection for the orphan; perhaps she did not know that he loved her. And so Augustine's gentle voice and blue eyes lighted the soul of the orphan, who had been abandoned by her mother. And as the orphan's soul burned, Augustine's desire to know more of the world grew. And her heart was filled with love, and she felt that all things were of higher value. The two young people's eyes meet by sheer need of change in the midst of persistent work and cloistered peace, was sure, sooner or later, to give rise to feelings of love. Nothing could be more natural than these two passions at cross-purposes, born in the silence of the dingy shop, as violets bloom in the depths of a wood. The.  Augustine of Aphorism: The habit of seeing always the same face leads insensibly to our reading there the qualities of the soul, and at last effaces all its defects. The habits of the heart and mind are the same, but the soul is different. The soul of the mind is the same but the personality is different, and the soul changes with it. The habit is the soul of a person, the personality of a human being, is different but the spirit of a man. The spirit of the human being is different and the personality changes with the soul.. This was the state of the affairs in the tiny republic which, in the heart of the Rue Saint-Denis, was not unlike a dependency of La Trappe. So the hapless assistant, whose heart was as warm as his legs were long and his chest deep, suffered in silence. To give a full account of events as well as of feelings, it is needful to go back to some months before the scene with which this story opens. At dusk one evening, a young man passing the darkened shop of the Cat and Racket, had paused for a moment to gaze at a picture. The painter was a young painter who had just returned from Rome. He had long been a prey to the fire of Italian passion. His heart craved one of those modest and meditative maidens whom in Rome he had unfortunately seen only in painting. He thirsted for real nature after long dwelling in the pompous land where art has everywhere left something grandiose. Right or wrong, this was his personal feeling. The painter's heart, which had long. been a victim of the passion of Italian art, craved. one ofthose modest andMeditative Maidens whom he had fortunately seen only. in Rome.. The artist involuntarily compared her to an exiled angel dreaming. Augustine seemed to be pensive, and did not eat. By the arrangement of the lamp the light fell full on her face, and her bust seemed to move in a circle of fire, which threw up the shape of her head."

The author calls on the help of the holy to help him write the book. The book is called ""The Marriage of the Lady of the Isle of Wight"" and is published by Piatkus, London, in 18th century. It was written by a son of the Sire of the same name, who died in 1816. The work is published in French, with English translations.. Always leading a solitary life, this said man had no idea of making himself agreeable to others, having only been mixed up with wars and the orgies of bachelors. In short, he looked the ugliest man in Christendom. As far as his heart, his head, and other secret places were concerned, he had properties which rendered him most praiseworthy. An angel (pray believe this) would have walked a long way without meeting an old warrior firmer at his post, a lord with. When he was sixty in appearance, although only fifty in years, he determined to take unto himself a wife, in order to obtain lineage. While foraging about for a place where he might be able to find a lady to his liking, he heard much vaunted, the great merits and perfections of a daughter of the illustrious house of Rohan. The young lady in question was called Bertha, that being her pet name. Imbert having been to see her at the castle of Montbazon, was, in consequence of the prettiness and innocent virtue of the said Bertha de Rohan, seized with so great a desire to possess her. He determined to make her his wife.. The Sire de Bastarnay was Duke by the grace of Louis the Eleventh. He was also his chamberlain and ambassador in the countries of Europe. His loyalty was an heritage from his father, who from his early youth was much attached to the Dauphin, whose fortunes he followed, even in the rebellions, since he was a man to put Christ on the cross again if it had been required by him to do so. He got her with a child so roughly that he had proof of the result two months after marriage, which rendered the Sire Imbert joyful to a degree.. The French king was a man of great virtue. He was a lover of his mother's breasts. He would have slaughtered any one who had said an evil word about her. He gave up the government of his house to the said Bertha. He made her mistress of his deeds and actions. She was queen of his honour, guardian of his grey hairs. He gnawed at her breasts, hungry, as often as he would, and was, like a lover, always there. She nourished him with her milk, and made of him a lover's lieutenant. She gave him her pretty breasts, which he gnawed.. This good mother knew no other pleasures than those of his rosy lips. She had no other caresses that those of her tiny little hands, which ran about her like the feet of playful mice. She read no other book than. Bertha made herself a child as he was a child, educated him in the perfect religion of maternity. She behaved as the best and happiest mother that ever lived, without disparagement to our Lady the Virgin, who could have had little trouble in bringing up our Saviour, since he was God. After six years had passed away, the mother was compelled to give her son into the hands of the grooms and other persons to whom Messire de Bastarnay committed the task to mould him properly. Then did Bertha shed many tears, her happiness being gone. She was the mother of the future king of France, who was born in 1788.. The writer has taken care here to give the mute reasons for this strange antipathy; I mean the distastes of Bertha. I love the ladies above all things, knowing that for want of the pleasure of love, my face would grow old and my heart torment me. Did you ever meet a scribe so complacent and so fond of the ladies as I am? No; of course not. And this is true, or no doctrine istrue, and you must burn the Gospels as a pack of stories if you have not faith in this innocent remark.. The good man Bastarnay was not a smart young fellow of an amorous nature, and acquainted with the pranks of the thing. He did not trouble himself much about the fashion in which he killed a soldier so long as he killed him. The perfect heedlessness in the matter of death was in accordance with the nonchalance of life, the birth and manner of begetting a child, and the ceremonies thereto appertaining.. The good sire was ignorant of the many litigious, dilatory, interlocutory and proprietary exploits and the little humourings of the little fagots placed in the oven to heat it. The ladies love better than their salvation, because there is more of the cat than the woman in them. This shines forth in perfect evidence in. Women are different from men in that they pick their food and eat it with finesse. They play with their knife and spoon as if they are only ate in consequence of a judge's order. This is the reason that the sons of Adam delight in them, since they do everything differently to themselves, and they do well. Imbert de Bastarnay, an old soldier, ignorant of the tricks of love, entered into the sweet garden of Venus as he would into a place taken by assault, and placed a child as he'd an arrow in the dark. He did not pay any attention to the cries of the poor inhabitants.. Bertha was not used to such treatment (poor child, she was but fifteen), she believed in her virgin faith, that the happiness of becoming a mother demanded this terrible, dreadful bruising and nasty business. So during his painful task she would pray to God to assist her, and recite /Aves/ to our Lady, esteeming her lucky, in only having the Holy Ghost to endure. By this means, never having experienced anything but pain in marriage, she never troubled her husband to go through the ceremony again. Now seeing that the old fellow was scarcely equal to it--as has been before stated--she lived in perfect solitude, like a nun. She hated the. This is the true history of certain unhappy unions, according to the statement of the old men and women, and the certain reason of the follies committed by certain women. Therefore study well this page, in order that you may wisely look to the proper government of your wives, your sweethearts, and all females generally. And particularly those who by chance may be under your care, from which God preserve you.. Bertha lived near the town of Loches, in the castle of her lord, and there resided, with no desire to do anything but look after her household duties. The said Bastarnay took great pleasure in beholding this child come, go, and frisk about like a willow-switch, as lively as an eel, as innocent as her little one, and still most sensible and of sound understanding. He never undertook any project without consulting her about it, seeing that if the minds of these angels have not been disturbed in their purity, they give a sound answer. The king invited the lady of Bastarnay to his town of Loches. She was the centre of the homage of all the young nobles, who feasted their eyes on this apple of love. But you may be sure that all of them, old and young, would have suffered death a thousand times over to have at their service this instrument of joy, which dazzled their eyes and muddled their brains.. Bertha was more talked about in Loches then either God or the Gospels. A young lady having early perceived that one of her lovers was smitten with Bertha, took such a hatred to her that from it arose all the misfortunes of the lady of Bastarnay. From the same source came her happiness, and her discovery of the gentle land of love, of which she was ignorant. This wicked lady had a relation who had confessed to her, directly he saw Bertha that to be her lover he would be willing to die after a month's happiness with her. Bear in mind that this cousin was as handsome as a girl is beautiful, had no hair on his chin,. Bertha's eyes full of limpid water, no marks on the temples, no little black speck on the point of her little nose, white as snow, where usually the marks of the amusement are visible. No wrinkle on her brow; in short, no habit of pleasure apparent on her face--clear as the face of an innocent maiden. The plotting lady suspected that poor Bertha was a maiden in matters of love, when she saw her eyes full. of water. The young gentleman out of the way, the lady came rubbing her nose against Bertha's.. Bertha was told of a young and noble lady, of the family of a Rohan, who at that time had need of the assistance of a lady of position to be reconciled with the Sire Louis de Rohan. Bertha consented without hesitation, because the misfortunes of this girl were known to her, but not the poor young lady herself, whose name was Sylvia, and whom she had believed to be in a foreign land. It is here necessary to state why the king had given this invitation to the Sires de Bastarnay. The king had wanted to impress the Rohan family with his good will.. Imbert had a suspicion of the first flight of his son the Dauphin into Burgundy, and wished to deprive him of so good a counsellor as was the said Bastarnay. Therefore he took Bertha back to his castle; but before they set out she told him she had taken a companion and introduced her to him. It was the young lord, disguised as a girl, with the assistance of his cousin, who was jealous of Bertha, and annoyed at her virtue. Imbert drew back a little when he learned that it was Sylvia de Rohan, but was also much affected. The young man was brought up by the Cardinal Dunois. He was a page for the king. The old lord thought him very modest and timid. He made a vow to build a pillar at his own expense in the cathedral. He gave, indeed, fifty gold marks to pay God for his delight. The young man then made his way to the city of Tours. He then made a deal with the king to marry the young woman. The deal was agreed and the young man married the young lady. The king was then able to leave the country. The boy was so happy that he made a promise to his lord to keep.. The story of the death of the Sire de Sacchez is told by the son of the Sieur de Montmorency. The young Sire was the son-in-law of the late Sire of the Mont morency, who was killed in battle. The story is told from the point of view of a young man, who had a hard job to get through the first day of his new job. The tale is told in the form of a speech by the young man's cousin, Bertha. The narrative is succinct, as all good speeches should be, but the story is not.. ""Do you like music? We will play together. Let us sing the lay of some sweet ancient bard. Eh? What do you say? Come to my organ; come along. As you love me, sing!"" ""Ah! sweet coz you have a wonderful glance in your eye; you move I know not what in my heart."" ""That it is which has been my ruin,"" replied the false Sylvia. ""Cousin, does love then, commence in the eyes?"" said the lover. ""In them is the forge of Cupid's bolts, my dear Bertha,"" replied the cousin. ""Let us go on with our singing,"" said Sylvia. ""Ah! cousin, what a deep and powerful voice you have,"" replied Bertha. ""It seems to pierce me,"" said the impudent Sylvia. They then sang, by Jehan's desire, a lay of Christine de Pisan.. ""Let us leave off singing,"" said Bertha; ""it has too great an effect upon. ""Ah! dear cousin of my soul, I don't know how to hold the needle in my fingers, having been accustomed, to my perdition to do something else with them"" ""Eh! what did you do then all day long?"" ""Ah! I yielded to the current of love, which makes days seem Instants, months seem days, and years months"" ""In the married state everything is duty, but in love everything is done in perfect freedom of heart"" ""Oh no,"" said Sylvia; ""because in the marriedState everything is Duty, but In Love everything is. ""Cousin, let us change the conversation; it affects me more than did the music"" ""This difference communicates an indescribable soft balm to those caresses which are the flowers of love"" ""Give me thy hands, that I may eat them; give me thine ears, thatI may bite them"" ""Thou art thy mother's blessing, her unclouded joy, the delight of her every hour"". ""Ah! cousin,"" said Sylvia, ""you are speaking the language of love to him"" ""Yes, cousin; therefore the heathen always portrayed him as a little boy."" ""Would you like to have another?"" whispered Jehan, at an opportune moment, into his cousin's ear. ""Ah! Sylvia! for that I would ensure a hundred years of purgatory, if it would only please God to give me that joy"" ""If I hear the sound of a cry in the castle, my heart beats ready to burst. I fear man and beast alike for this innocent darling"". ""I believe that my breath is in him, and not in myself,"" she said. ""I live not in me, but in him alone"" ""I like to endure these miseries, because when I fidget, and tremble, it is a sign that my offspring is safe and sound"" ""It would only be following the commandments of God to win this saint to love,"" said Bertha. ""And he thought right"" ""Nothing would give her greater pleasure,"" said her cousin. ""Nothing"" was the answer to Bertha's question. ""What would give you greater pleasure?"". ""My lord, inflamed with desire, soon tumbled, happy at being able to catch an occasional glimpse of the wondrous charms of the chatelaine,"" says the author. The two cousins were in a chamber richly ornamented with carpeting, fringes, and royal tapestries. The curfew rang, and found the two cousins in a room richly decorated with carpet and fringes. ""You can imagine that her companion modestly declined their services, and told her cousin, with a little blush, that she was accustomed to undress herself ever since she had lost the services. Bertha, believing herself to be with an experienced girl, did not omit any of the usual practices. She washed her feet, not minding whether she raised them little or much, exposed her delicate little shoulders, and did as all the ladies do when they are retiring to rest. At last she came to bed, and settled herself comfortably in it, kissing her cousin on the lips, which she found remarkably warm. ""Are you unwell, Sylvia, that you burn so?"" said she.. ""I do not know I ought to obey you, sweet cousin,"" said the youth. ""Tell me, why not?"" said the false maiden. ""Ah! deeds are better than words,"" replied the young man. ""I love thee more than God, and would endure a thousand deaths for the happiness I ask of thee"" ""I will kiss you in a peculiar dove-like fashion,"" replied Bertha. ""And then your misfortunes will have been a salutary lesson to two poor weak women"" ""And I will kiss your neck,"" said Bertha, ""and then your lips, and your breasts, and. ""Ah!"" said Bertha, fast bound in love without knowing it; ""this is better. I must take care to tell Imbert about it"" ""Say nothing about it to your old husband,"" said her cousin. ""How could he make his hands pleasant like mine?"". ""So beautiful is the music, that I hear nothing else, and so flaming are their luminous rays, that my eyes are closing"" ""Do you know that it is a living flower, which should be fondled thus, and not used like a trombone, or as if it were a catapult of war?"" ""Now this was the gentle way of my beloved Englishman"" ""The angels are come!"" ""Ah! cousin, the angels are coming!"" ""The joys of love burst forth"". Bertha imagined herself to be in Paradise, so happy did she feel; and woke from this beautiful dream in the arms of Jehan. She fell upon her knees before her /Prie-Dieu/, joined her hands, and wept more pearls than ever Mary Magdalene wore. ""Ah! I am dead"" she cried; ""I am deceived by a devil who has taken the face of an angel. I am lost"" ""I would give a thousand lives for you if he had them,"" said Jehan, ""for I am. Hearing that she said nothing against him, Jehan rose, quite aghast to see Bertha take this charming dance for two so to heart. Implore the pardon"

The old chronicler who furnished the hemp to weave the present story, is said to have lived at the time when the affair. The story of the Tryballot and his son. The son was a skilled artisan, so economical and careful that he left considerable wealth to his son, but he frittered it away. The old man was very popular in the duchy, where everyone had grown used to him, so much so that if the month went by without anyone seeing his cup held towards them, people would say, ""Where is the old man?"". From his earliest youth Tryballot was fascinated by the habits of the birds. He would study their habits, and took delight in watching with what grace they came and went, flew off loaded, and returned, watching with a quick eye the snares and nets. One day his father told him that he would be wise to model himself after them, for that if he continued this kind of life, he. Tryballot was a man who spent all his money on gambling and drinking. He was so successful that he was able to leave his wealth to the devil. Tryballot had no friends, and no one knew him. He chose to work in a profession in which there was nothing to do and plenty to gain. He died in a rage, but when the devil cut him up, he said he had studied philosophy in the school of the birds.. The good man watched the peasants planting, sowing, reaping, and making harvest, and said to himself, that they worked a little for him as well. Thinking this over, he remembered the indulgences of the blackbirds and the sparrows. Then the good Tryballot selected for his profession that of begging money at people's houses, and. Vieux par-Chemins was at all the weddings, baptisms, and funerals, because he went everywhere where there was, openly or secretly, merriment and feasting. He religiously kept the statutes and canons of his order--namely, to do nothing. According to him, suppers produced gout in the rich.. Vieux par-Chemins kept three dice to remind him to spend his coppers, in order that he might always be poor. But he was so wealthy that one day at the Paschal feast, another beggar wishing to rent his profit from him, Vieux Parchemins refused ten crowns for it. In fact, the same evening he spent 14 crowns in drinking the health of the alms-givers.. Vieux par-Chemins lived a happy life. He did nothing except according to his fancy, and lived nobly without labour. He believed that if he had persevered in the race for wealth he would have been spoiled and buried years before. It is possible he was right. He had the healthiest colour and complexion imaginable.. His secret virtues brought about, it is said, that popularity which he enjoyed in the provinces. He was always ready to give the ladies his assistance in counting the joists. Advancing in age, this great quintessencer found himself disdained, although his notable faculties of loving were in no way impaired. He declared before the judge that that had caused the greatest astonishment of his long and honourable life.. A man saw a girl who by chance was a maiden and minding cows in the fields. She was awakened by the deed of the old man, who had stolen from her that which a poor girl could only lose once. She cried out so loudly that the people working in the field ran to her, and were called upon by her as witnesses. He made answer to the peasants,who had already raised their hoes to kill him,. The girl, interrogated by the provost, declared that she was sleeping in order to do something. She thought she was dreaming of her lover, with whom she was then at loggerheads. This trial caused so great a commotion in the town of Rouen, that the duke was sent for. He wanted to know if the thing were true, and to find out if it was true.. Vieux par-Chemins was brought to the palace to make his defence. The duke listened to the arguments of the beggar and said that he was a man of good parts. He then ordered him to be hanged at the foot of the ladder. But a lady told the duke that religion demanded that he should have a fair chance.. The cowherdess dressed herself as if for a ball. She brought intentionally into evidence two hillocks of such snowy whiteness that the whitest linen neckerchief would have paled before them. This noble lady, who was one of those who rouse one's manhood, had a smile ready on her lips for the old fellow.. ""I have gained my pardon but I cannot answer for my saviour,"" he said. The guards, whose business it was to proceed to a verification, believed the culprit to be the devil. He was marched in triumph through the town to the palace of the duke. The affair was thought so much of that the town voted for the erection of a column on the spot.. The statue was still to be seen when Rouen was taken by the English, and the writers of the period have included this history among the notable events of the reign. The town offered to supply the old man with all he required, and see to his sustenance, clothing, and amusements. The good duke arranged matters by giving the injured maiden a thousand crowns and marrying her to. The House of Bonne-C------ was known by this name, and founded families in many provinces. The first Sieur de Bon-Chose lived another 27 years, and had another son and two daughters. But he grieved much at becoming rich, and no longer being able to pick up a living in the street.

Tristan was not a merry fellow, but he was the son of the king. He was a terrible man, but his father was a good king. The king's sons were the provstroyal and the provestroyal.. The name ""Pit"" is a French word for a person with a long name. It means ""to be happy"" or ""to laugh"" or to be happy. The word ""pitt"" means to smile. The name ""pit"" is also used to refer to a person who is happy, as in the case of the ""pint"" of the pitt, which is a person's name. ""Pitt"" is the name of a man who is happiest when he is smiling. The ""pett"" in the name is a word for ""to smile"". Petit was all the more suited to his occupation of watching and catching evil-doers. Can you find in all Christendom a more virtuous provost? No! All provosts hang too little, or too much, while this one just hanged as much as was necessary to be a provost. He had for his wife in legitimate marriage, and much to the astonishment of everyone, the prettiest little woman in Bourges. When he was between the sheets he never troubled himself about thieves. He was a bit of a cuckold, for all vice, he went to vespers. For all wisdom he obeyed God, when it was convenient. The town's sheriff had a wife so beautiful that a donkey would bray with delight. The town's wags said she did not keep her affections solely for him. Petit's wife was a virtuous woman, who had a lover for pleasure and a husband for duty. If you can point out one to me, I'll give you a kick or a half-penny, whichever you like. The story of Petit and his wife is told in the novel ""The Last Sheriff"" by William Faulkner, who died in 1849. The novel is published by Macmillan at a cost of $25,000.. The good Madame Petit was not one of those ladies who are always on the move, running hither and thither, can't keep still a moment, but trot about. She was a good housewife, always sitting in her chair or sleeping in her bed, ready as a candlestick, waiting for her lover when her husband went out. This dear woman never thought of dressing herself only to annoy and make other wives jealous. She had nothing in them to keep them steady, but are so light that they run after a gastric zephyr as after their quintessence. She never thought about dressing herself to annoy or make other women jealous.. The provost's lieutenant in duties matrimonial, duties which are so heavy that it takes two men to execute them, was a noble lord, a landowner, who disliked the king exceedingly. The Constable, who was a thorough Scotch gentleman, had seen by chance Petit's wife, and wished to have a little conversation with her comfortably, towards the morning. But Petit refused to listen to the said constable. After certain arguments, reasonings, tricks and messages, which were of no avail, he swore by his great black /coquedouille/ that he would rip up the gallant although he was a man of mark.. The constable wagered his big black /coquedouille/ before the king and the lady of Sorel, who were playing cards before supper. But he swore nothing about the lady. This denotes a good Frenchman, for in such a dilemma there are certain offended persons who would upset the whole business of three persons by killing four. /Douille/ signifies in Brittany, a girl, and /coque/ means a cook's frying pan. The king was well pleased, because he would be relieved of this noble, that displeased him, and that without costing him a Thank You.. ""Coquin"" is a French word for a knave. The word is derived from the word ""coquedouille"" which means a household utensil in the shape of a kettle used for cooking things. ""Coquin,"" as the word means ""to eat up,"" came from the French word ""cquédouille,"" which means to eat up.. ""Come to supper,"" said Madame Agnes.

""You've insulted me. I've. The king ordered the provost to return to town to seize an English nobleman. The provost was joyous at the chance to speak to the king. He was in town just at that time when the two lovers were singing the first note of their evening hymn. The king's words to the lovers: ""Tell your mistress I will not stint her in anything she desires"" The lovers were killed in a duel at the end of the day, with the king's son the victor, and the king was taken to prison for a short time.. The king and his wife were in bed together when the constable and the provost arrived. The king argued that he had a right to kill the man, not the woman. The constable argued that the king was clement, and that he should not kill the woman, but not the man. The queen was pleased, and so was the king. The lord of cuckoldom and its surrounding lands was pleased.. ""I would scrunch the five hundred thousand devils of nature, flower and seed, and send them flying,"" said the provost. ""That is contrary to the laws of the Church and of the State,"" replied the king. ""We can then only kill the knight--Amen,"" said constable, ""Kill the horseman"" ""I clearly perceive you to be the centre of all justice,"" said a courtier.. The provost, believing he would certainly be Chancellor of France if he properly acquitted himself of the task, went from the castle into the town. He arrived at the nobleman's residence, arranged his people outside, placed guards at all the doors, opened noiselessly by order of the king. He then climbs the stairs, asks the servants in which room their master is, puts them under arrest, goes up alone, and knocks at the door of the room where the two lovers are tilting in love's tournament, and says to them-- ""Open, in the name of our lord the. The king's provost asked the lover to accompany him to the castle. The lover thought it was a piece of treachery on the part of the constable. The king then decided to take the lover with him. The provost refused to take his lover. The lord then took the cuckold with him and took the lover away from the court and the king's household. She was later found dead. The constable was found guilty of murder. The court was cleared of any wrongdoing. The queen was acquitted of any wrong-doing. The trial was adjourned until later.. ""No one more than myself hates the English, who took my estates in Piccadilly,"" he said. ""A chamberlain is worth two of you, and I will beat you yet,"" he warned the constable. ""Willingly,"" said the provost, ""I give you permission to search by night and by day, every nook and cranny of my house"" ""Only allow me to cover with a cloth or a handkerchief this fair lady, who is at present in the costume of an archangel, in order that you may not know to what husband she belongs,"" he added.. ""I am an old bird, not easily caught with chaff,"" said the lord. ""These English have flesh as white and soft as women, and I know it well, because I've hanged so many of them."" ""I will go and ask my lady-love to consent for a moment to abandon her modesty,"" he said.. The lady had folded up all her clothes, and put them under the bolster, had taken off her chemise, that her husband should not recognise it, had twisted her head up in a sheet, and had brought to light the carnal convexities which commenced where her spine finished. The provost looked up the chimney, opened the cupboard, the clothes' chest, felt under the bed, in the sheets, and everywhere. Then he began to study what was on the bed.. ""You must forgive me doing my duty, but I must see otherwise"" ""What do you call otherwise?"" said the lord. ""The physiognomy of the other"" ""Or, if you prefer it, the. The king's wife was so modest that she would die rather than expose an atom of her body, he said. The constable, followed by the provost, went to the latter's house in less time than it would have taken a beggar to empty the poor-box. They succeeded in waking the lady, who pretended to be terrified, and was so soundly asleep that her eyes were full of gum. The king said: ""True,"" said the king; ""it was not made to be shown."". The provost was in great glee, saying to the constable that someone had certainly deceived him, that his wife was a virtuous woman. The constable turned on his heel and departed. The good provost began directly to undress to get to bed early, since this adventure had brought his good wife to his memory. When he was harnessing himself, and was knocking off his nether garments, madame, still astonished, said to. ""And you saw without my permission a lady of the court! Ha! ha! heu! hein!"" ""Well,"" said she, ""am I nicer?"" ""Ah,"" said he, ""in a great measure"" ""Ah! You won't love me any more are after seeing how beautiful court ladies are!"" ""Nonsense, my child!

0.49,0.59,37.07592891760905," Angelo Cappara was an Italian sculptor and engraver. He was a friend of Charles the Eighth. He is said to have been charming as a dream and melancholy as a dove left solitary in its nest by the death of its mate. He died in 1855. The work he created has since been ruined. He has been described as 'charming' and 'magnificent' by his friends.. The Florentine, out of bravado, came to the court gallantly attired, and from the timidity of youth and misfortune dared not ask his money from the king. The courtiers and the ladies used all to admire his beautiful works, and also their author; but of money he got none. And this was the reason thereof: this sculptor knew the curse of poverty, which mars and troubles all the actions of life.. Master Angelo had a large heart, a head full of poetry, and lofty imaginings. He had little confidence in himself, like all poor and unfortunate people. He fancied that he was ill-fashioned, either in body or mind, and kept his thoughts to himself. I am wrong, for he told them in the clear starlight nights to the shadows, to God, to the devil, and everything about him. At such times he would lament his fate in having a heart so warm, that doubtless the ladies avoided him.. Cappara was a young sculptor. He was smitten with the young ladies. He would seek them out and kiss, fondle, caress, bite, and clasp them. The ladies would criticise these beauties, and all of them were smitten. Cappara died in a tragic accident in 1837. He is buried in the Capparas' ancestral home. The story of his life is told in the play, The Capparinas.. Among these high-born ladies there came one day one by herself to the young Florentine. She asked him why he was so shy, and if none of the court ladies could make him sociable. Then she graciously invited him to come to her house that evening. He was so much over head and ears in love, that the perspiration trickled down his back. He knew not what to do with his heart, which leaped and bounded like a goat.. The sculptor found her seated by the fire in a high chair, and the lady immediately commenced to converse at her ease. Angelo could find no other replies than ""Yes"" and ""No,"" could get no other words from his throat nor idea in his brain. He would have beaten his head against the fireplace but for the happiness of gazing at and listening to his lovely mistress, who was playing there like a young fly in the sunshine. Because, which this mute admiration, both remained until the middle of the night, wandering slowly down the flowery path of love, the good. The Florentine chiselled away at his statues, thinking of his evening, and thus spoiled many a nose thinking of something else. When he was in the presence of his sovereign, her feminine majesty made itself felt, and poor Cappara, such a lion in street, looked sheepish when gazing at his victim. This notwithstanding, towards the hour when desire becomes heated, he was almost in the lady's lap and held her tightly clasped.. The sculptor had obtained a kiss, had taken it, much to his delight. When they give it, the ladies retain the right of refusal, but when they left it to be taken, the lover may take a thousand. This is the reason why all of them are accustomed to let it be taken. The Florentine has stolen a great number, and things were going on admirably, when the lady, who had been thrifty with her favours, cried, ""My husband!"". ""The Florentine"" is a novel about a lover and his wife. The love story is told through the eyes of the lover. The lover is afraid his wife's husband will cross him. The woman is afraid of her husband's friends. The lovers kiss for hours. The kiss becomes passionate.. ""I will not kill you, madame,"" said he, ""but I will mark your face in such a manner you will never again coquette with young lovers whose lives you waste"" Then he raised his arm, and held the sword ready to cut off a good slice of the fresh fair cheek, where still all the traces of his kiss remained. If he complain to the king, my friends will say, they thought they were playing a joke on one of their own set.. ""Hold your tongue,"" said he; ""you told me that you loved me better than anything"" ""Ah, woman of the court and wicked heart, thou lovest, then, thy face better than thy lover."" With a single blow Angelo slashed her face, then left her house, and quitted the country. But she spoke not a word in spite of her agony; she loved her Cappara more than life itself.. Cappara, the Florentine, was hanged at Blois. On the day of execution a noble lady was seized with a desire to save this courageous man. She begged the king to give him to her, which he did willingly. Cappara declaring that he belonged entirely to his lady, the memory of whom he could not banish entirely, entered the Church, became a cardinal and a great savant, and used to say in his old age that he had existed upon the remembrance of the joys tasted in those poor hours of anguish..

His father had fallen into great disgrace, and left his son Jacques penniless in Touraine. Jehan had in his head a firm intention to save his father, and make his fortune at the court. At early dawn this good Tourainian left his lodging, and, enveloped in his mantle, all except his nose, walked about the town without any trouble of digestion. He entered the churches, thought them beautiful, looked into the chapels, flicked the flies from the pictures, and counted the columns all after.. The author feigned to recite his paternosters, but really made mute prayers to the ladies, offered them holy water when leaving, followed them afar off, and endeavoured by these little services to encounter some adventure. He had in his girdle two doubloons which he spared far more than his skin, because that would be replaced. Each day he took from his little hoard the price of a roll and a few apples, with which he sustained life, and drank at his will and his discretion of the water of the Loire. This wholesome and prudent diet kept him frisky and light as a greyhound, gave him a clear understanding and a warm heart for the water.. Jacques de Beaune was walking along the embankment. He nearly ran against a veiled lady whose sweet odour gratified his amorous senses. She wore a beautiful dress of Italian velvet, with wide slashed satin sleeves. Through her veil a white diamond of reasonable size shone upon her forehead like the rays of the setting sun. She walked like a lady who was only accustomed to a litter. One of her pages followed her, well armed. She was evidently some light o'love belonging to a noble of high rank or a lady of the court, since she held her dress high off the ground, and bent her back like a woman of quality.. Jacques de Beaune followed his mistress along the bank of the Loire towards Plessis. He wanted to find out where she would lead him to Paradise or hell. He turned briskly round with a savage and threatening face, like that of a dog whose says, ""Stand back, sir!"" But the good Tourainian had his wits about him and he managed to stay on his feet. The story was published in 17th-century France. The novel was written by Jean-Baptiste de Beauvoir and published in Paris in 1799.. Jacques de Beaune was a thorough ladies' man. He could walk by the side of a princess without disgracing her. He had a brave and resolute air which please the sex. If he was a little browned by the sun from being so much in the open air, his skin would look white enough under the canopy of a bed. The glance, keen as a needle, which the lady threw him, appeared to him more animated than that with which she would have honoured her prayer-book. He thought that if a cat may look at king, he, a baptised Christian, might certainly look at a pretty woman, he stepped forward, and feigning to grin at the page.. The Sieur de Beaune followed into the town the lady, who returned by the Rue des Trois-Pucelles. She led the gallant through a labyrinth of little streets, to the square in which is at the present time situated the Hotel de la Crouzille. There she stopped at the door of a splendid mansion, at which the page knocked. A servant opened it, and the lady went in and closed the door. The Sieur was left open-mouthed, stupefied, and as foolish as Monseigneur St. Denis when he was trying to pick up his head. He raised his nose in the air to see if some token of favour would be thrown to him.. Jacques de Beaune, delighted at this, flung himself against the wall, crying ""I am killed,"" with a feeble voice. Then stretching himself upon the fragments of broken china, he lay as if dead, awaiting the issue. The servants rushed out in a state of alarm, fearing their mistress, to whom they had confessed their fault, and picked up the wounded man, who could hardly restrain his laughter at being then carried up the stairs. ""He is covered with blood,"" said the butler, who while feeling his pulse had wetted his hand. ""I will pay for a mass to St. Vincent de Paul,"" replied the guilty one.. The Tourainian's doublet caught on a projection. The Regent's servants brought Jacques de Beaune into a room, and laid him stiff and stark upon a table. ""He groans,"" said the culprit, with a sigh of relief. ""Certes, he's dead enough, he is so heavy."" ""Run and fetch a surgeon,"" cried Madame de Beaujeu. ""Run here, run there!"" The servants were down the stairs in a trice. ""Ah! I am in the house of a very great lady,"" thought Jacques.. ""Madame,"" cried Jacques de Beaune, springing from the table, and falling at the feet of the Regent. ""I will live to serve you, and am so little bruised that that I promise you this night as many joys as there are months in the year"" ""Ah! God wishes to punish me. Just for one little time in my life has there been born in me, and taken possession of me, a naughty idea, and my patron saint is angry, and deprives me of the sweetest gentleman I have ever seen,"" he said. ""By the rood, and by the soul of my father, I will hang every man who has had a hand in this!"". ""I fell madly in love with you, yet dared not, by reason of my great respect for your person, make an advance,"" he said. ""You can imagine how intoxicated I must have been with your royal beauties, to have invented the trick to which I owe the happiness of being at your feet"" The lady of Beaujeu, without appearing to be astonished while listening to the promises of this young man, kept this ambitious speech in the depths of her memory or of her registry of love, which caught fire at his words. ""In this critical and autumnal season, women formally virtuous and loveless desire now here, now there, to enjoy, unknown to the world, certain hours of love. The Regent put on the stern look of her father. Then she raised the Tourainian, who still found in his misery the courage to smile at his mistress. ""I am your very faithful subject, Jacques de Beaune, son of your steward, who has fallen into disgrace in spite of his faithful services,"" he said. ""Ah, well!"" replied the lady, ""lay yourself on the table again. I hear someone coming."" The good fellow perceived, by the soft sound of her voice, that he was pardoned the enormity of his love.. The Regent bathed her lover's temples, undid his doublet, and verified better than an expert how soft and young was the skin on this young fellow and bold promiser of bliss. Jacques stood up, and appeared to come to his senses, thanked the Regent most humbly, and dismissed the physicians, master surgeons, and other imps in black, saying that he had thoroughly recovered. But humanity never misbecomes those of royal blood. The Regent was amazed to see the Regents act thus, and all the bystanders, men and women, were amazed to hear her say it.. ""I cannot permit it,"" said she. ""Persons who come to my house should not meet with such treatment as you have encountered"" The page who had attended the lady during her promenade stepped forward. ""I give thee command of a company of archers,"" she said. ""Well said,"" replied the Regent. ""D'D'Orsay,"" said the page, ""I pray both pardon and reward him"" ""Well-said,"" replied she, ""D’Orsaye,’’ ‘I will have him found out and hanged by the provost.’. ""For the future do not throw things out of the window"" - Jacques de Beaune. ""But for the future, do notthrow things out the window."" - the Regent. ""For the present, don't throw anything out the windows. But for the present do not do anything at random."" ""For all I know, I am a good man, but I am not a very good man at all"" - the Sieur Jacques. ""I am a man who does everything at random. I am like a father in disposition, and did everything at Random"" -  the Regents' daughter.. The Regent sent for one of her secretaries, an adept in all arts necessary for the perfect government of a kingdom, and ordered him to give her secretly a false message during the supper. Then came the repast, which the lady did not touch, since her heart had swollen like a sponge, and so diminished her stomach, for she kept thinking of this handsome and desirable man. Jacques did not fail to make a good meal for many reasons. The messenger came, madame began to storm, and to knit her brows after the manner of the late king. ""Is there never to be peace in this land? Pasques Dieu!"" she asked.. ""You shall be my squire, Sieur de Beaune. You wish to serve the state. The occasion is a good one. Pasques Dieu! come! There are rebels to subdue, and faithful knights are needed"" ""You will rejoin me with my household at the Chateau d'Amboise...."" ""And looking at Jacques, she said, ""You shall Be my squires, Sieurs de Be aune"" ""In less time than an old beggar would have taken to say thank you, the horses were bridled, saddled, and ready. Madame was on her mare, and the Tourainian at. Jacques de Beaujeu was wounded by one of his servants. He was taken to the castle by the Regent. The Regent asked him if he was bruised. Jacques replied that he had been injured by the servant. The knight was taken away by his captors. The story was told in a book called ""Jacques"" by Jacques de BeauJeu. The book was published in 1763.. ""I am astonished,"" replied the Regent, ""never to have seen until today a noble youth whose courage is so apparent in his countenance"" ""I see well,"" continued he, ""my noble and beautiful mistress, that your servant has found favour in your sight."" ""There, there!"" replied she; ""did you not. ""You are agreeable to me, you please me, and you wish to do well,"" said the Regent to her lover. ""You may be sure that she had highly perfumed and elegantly attired herself for the night, and shone with desire for embraces"" ""In spite of her feeble resistance she was, like a young girl, carried by assault in her royal couch,"" she said. ""From play to quarrel, quarrel to riot, from riot to ribaldry, from thread to needle"" ""The Regent declared that she believed more in the virginity of the Holy Mary than in the promised dozen dozen"" ""You are a good lady, and a good man, and I am glad to have you as my wife,"" said Jacques.. Jacques de Beaune did not find this great lady so very old between the sheets, since everything is metamorphosed by the light of the lamps of the night. Jacques, happier at this sight than at that of the King on a hanging day, renewed his undertaking. Madame,. The French king's son was given the manor of Azay-le-Brule by the Regent of France. He was also given a fief, fiefs, and rights to the Isles of the Indre and the forest of Azy. He presented his liege homage to the Regents with a list of 11 periphrases. The king was given a chapel at Azay and the right to fish in the forest. He also received the right of fishing in the Isles and the meadows of La Carte. He is said to have also been given the fief of the forest and the land of La. The Tourainian had the great self-confidence to regale the Regent, keeping for her on her waking the salute of an honest man, as it was necessary for the lord of Azay to thank his sovereign. But when nature is oppressed, she acts like a spirited horse, lays down, and will die under the whip sooner than move until it pleases her to rise reinvigorated. The Regent got up, and while she was breakfasting with Jacques, he seized the occasion of this insufficiency to contradict her esquire, and pretend, that as he had not gained his wager, he hadn't earned the manor. ""Pasques dieu!"" replied the Regent with a forced laugh. ""I give you the place of the Sieur de Vieilleville in my house"" ""But my dear lady and noble sovereign it is not proper for either you. ""May I be hanged,"" said Jacques, turning the thing into a joke, because there was a shade of anger in the face of Madame de Beaujeu. ""Then, my lady,"" replied her good companion, ""I shall certainly be your squire"" ""I will give you Azay, and will place you in a royal office if you can, without injury to my honour, state the case in full council,"" said the king. ""If one word falls to the damage of my reputation as a virtuous women, I--"" ""If you can state it in fullCouncil, then I will give it to you,"" replied the queen.. A new squire came to accompany his mistress to a sitting of the council. He begged them to decide a point of law which concerned both himself and the property of the Crown. Jacques de Beaune, without being nervous at the sight of this august court, spoke as follows:--""Noble Lords, I beg you, although I am about to speak to you of walnut shells, to give your attention to this case, and pardon me the trifling nature of my language"" ""Listen to him,"" said the Regent. ""He speaks truly."" ""He spoke truly,"" replied the Queen, ""and he spoke truly."". ""That is, I believe the knotty point of the case,"" said Jacques turning towards the Regent. ""The younger boasted that he could throw twelve times through it a stick which he had in his hand at the time--as many people have who walk in a garden--and with each flight of the stick he would send a nut to the ground"" ""The other wagered to the contrary,"" went on the pleader. ""Now the first named throws his stick with such precision of aim, so gently, and so well that both derived pleasure therefrom"" But by chance the last of the fallen nuts was empty, and had no nourishing pulp from which could have come another nut tree. ""Has the man with the stick gained his wager? Judge,"" said the Regent. ""He is rather too clever,"" said she, tapping her squire on the cheek, ""He will be hanged one of these days"" She meant it as a joke, but these words were the real horoscope of the steward. He mounted the gallows by the ladder of royal favour, through the vengeance of another old woman, and the notorious treason of his secretary.. The Ganelon and bad servant gave, it is said, to Madame d'Angouleme, the receipt for the money which had been given him by Jacques de Beaune, then Baron of Samblancay. Of his two sons, one was Archbishop of Tours the other Minister of Finance and Governor of Touraine. But this is not the subject of the present history. Now that which concerns the present narrative, is that Madame de Beaujeu, to whom the pleasure of love had come rather late in the day, well pleased with the great wisdom and knowledge of public affairs which her chance lover possessed.. The first French king, Charles VII, was born in 17th century France. He was the son of a Huguenot who had lived in France for more than a century. He died in 1799, leaving his son Charles VII in charge of the country. Charles VII was the first French monarch to be born in France. The king was born on September 14, 17th Century, in the village of Chateau de Chateauneuf- sur-Bresse. He is the son-in-law of the Huguet, who died in 18th century.. The castle of Samblancay was hanged before it was finished. Since that time no one has been found with sufficient money to complete it. Nevertheless, King Francis the First was once his guest, and the royal chamber is still shown there. The castle is now owned by the French government. It is located in the commune of Saint-Germain-en-. The king wished to know what his minister meant by these strange words. Jacques de Beaune narrated to him the history with which you are acquainted. Francis the First, who was partial to these spicy stories, thought the adventure a very droll one. His mother, the Duchess d'Angouleme, in the decline of life, was pursuing the Constable of Bourbon, in order to obtain of him one of these dozens of lands. The king was more amused thereat because at that time his mother was pursuing him. The story was told to him by the Duchess of Bourbon and his wife.. The Chateau d'Azay was built by Samblancay, the son of the king of the Tourainian. The story has been handed down from father to son, and lord to lord. The author of our days, who brought this history to light, although a learned man, has allowed himself to be deceived by certain chroniclers, since the archives of the Roman Empire make no mention of an acquisition of this kind. It is therefore the falsest of falsities which attributes the dozen of the tourainian to a German knight, who by this deed would have secured the domains of Austria to the House of Hapsburgh. The castle is still respected down to the present day.. ""I am angry with him for having believed that a ""braguette"" nourished with beer, could have been equal to the alchemical operations of the Chinonian 'braguettes,' so much esteemed by Rabelais,"" writes the author. ""I have for the advantage of the country, the glory of Azay, the conscience of the castle, and renown"

She lived on the same side of the Loire as St. Cyr, about as far from the bridge which leads to the cathedral of Tours as Marmoustier is distant from it. She had to deliver the greater part of her work in Chateauneuf and other places. Seven years before marrying old Taschereau, she had just reached the right age to be loved, without making a choice from any of the lads who pursued her with their intentions. She was a very beautiful woman, and her name is still remembered today.. A young noble of the court perceived her one day when she was crossing the sun in the glare of the noonday sun. She was one of those girls who take great care not to be contaminated, but who, if by chance, let things take their course. These characters demand our indulgence. We should not be ashamed of them, they are the best of the best, and we should be proud of them. We must not be afraid of their virtue, we must not let them corrupt us. We are not afraid of the good things they have done for us, but we should not let the bad things happen.. A young lord, besides ruffles to starch, had many precious draperies and things. He resolved to give the custom of his house to this girl, whom he stopped on the road. He was the Sire du Fou, the king's chamberlain. This encounter made her so joyful that her mouth was full of his name. She talked about it a great deal to the people of St. Martin, and when she got back to the washhouse was still full of it. On the morrow at her work her tongue went nineteen to the dozen,. The first time this giddy wench, with her head full of Monsieur du Fou, had to deliver the linen at his hotel, the chamberlain wished to see her. He wound up by telling her that she was not at all silly to be beautiful, and therefore he would give her more than she expected. The deed followed the word, for the moment his people were out of the room, he began to caress the maid, who thinking he was about to take out the money from his purse, dared not look at the purse, but said, like a girl ashamed to take her wages-- ""It will be for the first time"". La Portillone awaited his return in his room, weeping and saying to the servant that she had been robbed. A canon of the Chapter used to give her large sums for that which M. du Fou wanted for nothing. If she loved a man she would think it wise to do things for him for nothing, because it would be a pleasure to her. But the chamberlain had treated her roughly, and not kindly and gently, as he should have done, and that therefore he owed her the thousand crowns of the canon.. The injured maiden replied that she did not wish the death of her man, but that he should pay her a thousand gold crowns, because she had been robbed against her will. ""Ha! ha!"" said the judge, ""what he took was worth more than that."" ""For the thousand crowns I'll cry quits, because I shall be able to live. The girl related naively how she was arranging the young lord's ruffles in his wardrobe, when he began to play with her skirt. ""I must know how the affair occurred,"" said the judge. ""Did you take pleasure in the affair?"" she asked. ""No,"" said she. ""A wench's antics to incite him"" said theJudge. ""Ha! ha!"" said La Portillone. ""By that speech he thought that you gave him leave to go on.. ""My anguish can only be paid for with a thousand crowns,"" said La Portillone. ""I believe no girl could be thus treated against her will,"" said the judge. ""Go and fetch my needle and the red thread that I sew the law paper bags with,"" he told his servant. ""Now go and fetch a big needle, pierced with a pretty little hole, and a big red thread, such as the judges use,"" he said. ""And a little red thread to sew a little hole in the top. The judge said he would make Monseigneur offer a compromise. The nymph suspected the judge's argument, wetted the thread, stretched it, and came back again. She remained standing to see the question decided, very much disturbed, as was also the complainant at these mysterious preparations. The judge gave the poor nymph fair play, holding the eye steady for her. But when she wished to slip in the thread that she had twisted to make straight, he moved a little, and the thread went on the other side. The waggish judge gave her fair play.. The judge moved, twisted about, and wriggled like a bashful maiden. The girl kept trying at the eye, and the judge kept fidgeting. The marriage of the thread could not be consummated, the bodkin remained virgin. The servant began to laugh, saying to La Portillone that she knew better how to endure than to perform. Then the roguish judge laughed too. The fair Port. The pretty wench, who declared she had been forced, remained thoughtful, and sought to find a means to convince the judge by showing how she had was compelled to yield. ""Monseigneur, in order that the bet made the fair, I must do exactly as the young lord did,"" she said. ""Let us hear them,"" replied the judge. ""Think, too, how easy is the one affair, and how difficult the other."". The judge was trying to put a thread into a case. The thread came out of the case out of order. The judge tried to put the thread in the case. But the thread kept coming out out oforder. The Judge laughed at the thread. He could not help it. He was a good judge. He laughed too, so saucy and comical and arch was she. She kept the poor judge with the case in his hand until seven o'clock, keeping on fidgeting and moving about like a schoolboy let loose. She burst out laughing.. The judge, convinced, told La Portillone that he would speak to Monseigneur du Fou, and would himself carry the affair through. On the morrow the judge went to the Court and saw Monseigne du Fou. The judge recounted the young woman's complaint, and how she had set forth her case. This complaint lodged in court, tickled the king immensely. The king said he would keep the affair dark for valid reasons, and that he was not guilty.. The king declared the girl was quite worth a hundred gold crowns, and the chamberlain gave them to the judge, in order not to be taxed with stinginess. The judge came back to La Portillone, and said, smiling, that he had raised a hundredgold crowns for her. But if she desired the balance of the thousand, there were at that moment in the king's apartments certain lords who, knowing the case, had offered to make up the sum for her, with her consent. The little hussy did not refuse this offer, saying, that in order to do no more washing in the future she did not mind doing a little hard work now. She gratefully acknowledged the trouble the good judge had taken, and gained her thousand crowns in a month.. The king sent La Portillone to his retreat of Rue Quinquangrogne, on the mall of Chardonneret. She went there, and the more willingly because she did not care very much for the king. When the good man came who confessed the king in his last hours, and was afterwards canonised, La Portilone went to him to polish up her conscience, did penance, and founded a bed in the leper- house of St. Lazare-aux-Tours. Many ladies whom you know have been assaulted by more than two lords, and have founded no other beds than those in their own houses.. The Reproach is a novel about a woman who washed dirty things and married a man who later cuckolded her. The author, who was once an honest girl, says the story is a proof of her merit in marrying Taschereau. The story proves that with strength"
0.86,0.96,74.4413407821229,"Children up to the age of ten years, for after that they become men or women, and cutting their wisdom teeth, are not worth what they cost; the worst are the best. Watch them playing, prettily and innocently, with slippers; above all, cancellated ones, with the household utensils, leaving that which displeases them, crying after that which pleases them. They are in every way lovable; besides which they are flower and fruit--the fruit of love, the flower of life. The finest work of man is neither poetry, nor painted pictures, nor music, nor castles, nor statues, be they carved never so well, nor rowing, nor sailing galleys, but children.. Queen Catherine was at that time Dauphine, and to make herself welcome to the king, her father-in-law presented her with Italian pictures. Do not expect a man to be innocent after the manner of children, because there is an ingredient of reason in the naivety of a man, while the naivete of children is candid, immaculate, and has all the finesse of the mother, which is plainly proved in this tale. This is as true as the double chewing machine of a cow. The story of the painting is told in the novel The Adventures of Houdini, which was published in 17th century France. The author, who was a friend of the painter Leonardo da Vinci, says. Madame Catherine of Tuscany obtained from her family a precious picture, painted by a Venetian named Titian. The picture was put into the room of the poor king, who was then ill with the disease of which he eventually died. It had a great success at the Court of France, where everyone wished to see it. But no one was able to until after the king's death, since at his desire it was allowed to remain in his room as long as he lived. One day Madame Catherine took with her to the King's room her son Francis and little Margot, who began to talk at random, as children will. They said: ""We are Adam and Eve, and we are going to Paradise."" And so they began to speak to each other in a language of their own, in which they spoke at random. And so it went on for a long time, until the King died, and then they were able to see the picture.. The children had heard this picture of Adam and Eve spoken about, and had tormented their mother to take them there. Since the two little ones at times amused the old king, Madame the Dauphine consented to their request. The reply, which delighted the poor king and the mother, was mentioned in a letter written in Florence by Queen Catherine. No writer having brought it to light, it will remain, like a sweet flower, in a corner of these Tales, although it is no way droll, and there is no other moral to be drawn from it except that to hear these pretty speeches of infancy one must beget the children. The story is told by the children's father, who is called Francis. The tale is told in the form of a short story by the author, called ""The Story of"

The French knight was in fact a younger son of an illustrious family. He was abandoned by his family, a most illustrious one, and never returned to Venice. The story was based on the good luck that happened to the French knight in Sicily, which was true in every respect. It was also a tale of the fall of a king, and of the death of his son, who was also French, and was never seen again. The tale was told in a book called The Death of The King of Sicilian, written by the Italian author, Giovanni Battista Girolamo di Giolamo.. A French knight was at a strange court, without trusty friends, when he met a Venetian. The Venetians said he must be a learned man to have travelled so much. The Frenchman replied that he had learned to give no heed to those who do not trouble about him. The French knight remained at this Court, where he was much liked by the king. He was later killed by a jealous rival. The story of the French knight is told in the novel The Death of a Knight. The book is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99.. ""You are, then, richer than I am,"" said the Venetian, astonished, ""since you tell me things of which I never thought"" ""I am disposed to forgive those who reject me,"" replied the Frenchman. ""The road, sir, if you please."" ""I have learnt to have no confidence in the warm days of winter, in the sleep of my enemies, or the words of my friends."" ""The night is closing in,"" said he. ""I can request from you the kindness of pointing to me the road to Palermo or some inn, for the night is Closing in"". ""If you were a robber, you would have to take care of yourself,"" said the Frenchman, putting the point of his dagger to the Venetian's heart. ""Should I be happier if everybody wanted me?"" he asked. ""You are a devil, who turns every one of my words against me"" ""Let us look for it in company,"" said Venetia. ""To do that we must go together; but you are on horseback, I am on foot."" ""I am a noble, established at the Court of Sicily, but alone, and I seek a friend"" ""You seem to be in the same plight, and, judging from appearances, you do not seem friendly with. The Frenchman jumped off the horse, and entered the house with the Venetian cavalier, accepting his supper. They both seated themselves at the table. The Frenchman fought so well with his jaws, he twisted the morsels with so much agility, that he showed it again in dexterously draining the wine flasks. Then you may be sure he had fallen in with a fine son of Adam, sprung from the right side and the wrong one. While they were drinking together, theVenetian endeavoured to find some joint through which to sound the secret depths of his friend's cogitations. The French replied: ""Mark! my lord knight, can one trust you?"" ""Yes,"" said the Venetsian, ""more than yourself, who commenced our federal friendship by deceiving me"". The king of Sicily, Pezare, wanted to make a friend of Prince Leufroid. He told him of the splendour of Sicily and of the prince's aspirations. The prince had plans to conquer Morocco, Constantinople, Jerusalem, and other African places. The king wanted to ruin Venice, which had not a foot of land in the Mediterranean. He felt himself weak, had no assistance from the courtiers, and desired to made a friend. He said he would cast aside his shirt sooner than his prudence, and judged it opportune to gain his esteem by opening his doublet to him. He then told him how gallant was the Court, what courtesy there flourished, and how there abounded many lords of Spain, Italy, France, and others. He also said that this prince had the loftiest aspirations--such as to conquer Moroccan, Constantinople and Jerusalem.. The Venetian offered to give the Frenchman his palace to live in. The Frenchman refused, saying he needed no assistance. The two men became friends, and helped each other on all occasions. The Venetians were later married, and the Venetia became a wealthy country. The French were later killed in a car accident. The story was told in the play ""The Adventures of Chevalier Pezare"" by Jean-Baptiste Lamarque, who was born in Paris in 17th century. The play was written by the French writer, and was set in Paris, in 1799. The book was published by the Paris-based magazine ""Le Monde"" (Paris, 1799).. ""Do you possess any relic with which your fortune is wound up?"" said the Venetian. ""A talisman given me by my dear mother,"" said the Touranian. ""With which castles and cities are built and demolished"" ""A hammer to coin money, a remedy for every ill, a traveller's staff always ready to be tried, and worth most when in a state of readiness, a master tool, which executes wondrous works in all sorts of forges, without making the slightest noise"". Gauttier showed to the Venetian the finest talisman to procure joy that he had ever seen. They swore an eternal friendship, regarding as nothing therein a woman's heart, vowing to have one and the same idea. They fell asleep on the same pillow enchanted with this fraternity. They were both in great astonishment at the sight of the secret charms of the said Gauttier, who had indeed been bounteously endowed by his mother, and perhaps also by his father. He joined to this corporeal perfection the wit of a young page, and the wisdom of an old devil. He would thus triumph over everything, since he joined the wit and wisdom of a page to that of a devil.. The Venetian gave a fine horse to his friend Gauttier, also a purse full of money, fine silken hose, a velvet doublet, fringed with gold, and an embroidered mantle. This was a common occurrence in those days. The servants received orders to obey this Gaut tier as they would himself, so that they fancied their master had been fishing, and had caught this Frenchman. If the king was a brave and handsome prince, the princess was a Spanish lady of high temperature, the most beautiful and most noble woman of his Court, but inclined to melancholy. Pezare presented his French friend, speaking so highly of his merits, and obtaining such a gracious reception for him, that Leufroid kept him to supper. The knight kept a sharp eye on the Court, and noticed therein various curious. Pezare pointed out to his friend Gauttier several ladies to whom Leufroid was exceedingly gracious and who were exceedingly jealous and fought for him in a tournament of gallantries and wonderful female inventions. From all this Gaut tier concluded that the prince went considerably astray with his court, although he had the prettiest wife in the world, and occupied himself with taxing the ladies of Sicily. The Sire de Monsoreau, certain that no one in the Court had had the heart to enlighten the queen, determined at one blow to plant his halberd in the field of the fair Spaniard by a master stroke; and this is how it happened.. The king took care to place him near the queen, to whom the gallant Gauttier offered his arm, to take her into the room, and conducted her there hastily, to get ahead of those who were following, in order to whisper, first of all, a word concerning a subject which always pleases. ""I know, your majesty, what causes your paleness of face,"" said Gauttier. ""What should I do to keep him alive?"" said the queen. ""Forbid him to repeat at your altar more than three prayers a day."" ""You are joking, after the French fashion, Sir Knight, seeing that the king's devotion to me does not extend beyond a short prayer a week,"" said the king. ""So you abuse your advantage, for he will die of love. ""I can prove to you that love should go through the whole mass, matins, and vespers, with an /Ave/ now and then, for queens as for simple women,"" said the knight. The queen cast upon the knight a glance which was far from one of displeasure, smiled at him, and shook her head. ""In this,"" said she, ""men are great liars."". ""I undertake to give you queen's fare, and put you on the high road to joy"" ""I shall reserve my advantage for your service"" ""If the king learns of our arrangement, he will put your head on a level with your feet"" ""Never have I seen, after visiting all Courts, a princess fit to hold a candle to your beauty"" ""Even if this misfortune befell me it after the first night, I should believe I had lived a hundred years. ""I am resolved to spend my life in your love, if life will depart in the place whence it comes"" ""What a shame to be young, beautiful, Spanish, and queen, and yet neglected"" ""If I die not by the sword, you will still be the cause of my death"" ""I will never forget you"" ""You will always be my love"" ""Your love will never leave me"" ""My love will not leave me."" ""I shall always remember you""""I will not forget you."" ""You are my love, and I will always rememberyou"" ""Her love will always remain"" ""She will never Forget You"" ""His love will remain."" ""Her life will never depart in a place whenceIt comes""  ""I shall never forget You""  ""I'll always remember You"". ""Sir Knight, let us change the subject, for it is very wrong of you to attack a poor queen in her weak spot"" ""Tell us the customs of the ladies of the Court of France"" ""So much so that when the siege was raised, Leufroid declared that he had never laughed so much in his life"" ""The king, the queen, and all the courtiers in a good humour."" ""The queen's husband, the king's son, the prince's son-in-law, and the. ""Lovely and noble queen,"" said Gauttier, immediately, ""I have seen in all countries the perdition of love have its birth in these first attentions, which we call courtesy"" ""Well said,"" said the queen, ""but as I am new at this business, I did not know what arrangements to make"" ""Yes,"" said she, ""and I have a maid who came from Spain with me, who would put herself on a gridiron for me like St. George"" ""I am sure you will do the same for me,"" replied the queen. ""Yes, I will,"" said he. ""And I will do it with you."" ""I will do that for you,"" she replied. ""I know you will."". ""O Jesus!"" cried the queen, ""I am doubly blessed in having a lover so handsome and yet so religious"" ""The Virgin Mary is very powerful in heaven,"" said the queen. ""For nothing she would have fled with this cunning Frenchman"" ""I make a vow to St. Rosalie, patroness of Sicily, to build her a gold altar for this fortune"" ""That's good,"" said her companion, ""because you go to see her."" ""Yes,"" said she, ""and sometimes at night."". The king was disturbed by a gleam of jealousy, cast into his heart by a Sicilian courtier. The queen and the chevalier laid their plans, and everything was secretly arranged to furnish the helmet of the king with two invisible ornaments. The knight rejoined the Court, made himself agreeable to everyone, and returned to the Palace of Pezare. He told that their fortunes were made, because on the morrow, at night, he would sleep with the queen.. The Venetian, like a good friend, went in search of fine perfumes, linen of Brabant, and precious garments, to which queens are accustomed. He loaded his friend Gauttier, in order that the case might be worthy the jewel. ""As for that, fear nothing, dear Pezare, because I have the arrears of the journey, and I will deal with her as with a simple servant,"" he said. ""I will instruct her in the ways of the ladies of Touraine, who understand love better than all others, because they make it, remake it, and unmake it to make it again and having remade it, still keep on making it,"" he added. ""Having nothing else to do, have to do that which always wants doing,"" said the king.. Gauttier's plan was to divide the courtiers into two parties under his command. He said: ""I shall hold the queen and you the king; we will play the comedy of being great enemies"" Gauttier said he would place the king with the queen, and he would give her supreme power. The plan was revealed in a letter to the queen in which she said she loved the French. Gaut tier said: 'I will place you with the king, through the channel of the queen. And he will give you supreme power, to my injury' The French queen said she had never seen such love in her life. Gautsier said he had never been happier in his life than when he was with the Spanish queen. The French were the only people who thoroughly understood love, he said.. The king was punished, who, to keep her virtuous, had allowed weeds to grow in the grange of love. Their supernatural festivities touched the queen so strongly that she made a vow of eternal love to Montsoreau. It was arranged that the Spanish lady should take care always to be ill; and that the only man to whom the lovers would confide their secret should be the court physician. By chance this physician had in his glottis, chords exactly similar to those of Gauttier, so that by a freak of nature they had the. Leufroid dismissed the Duke of Cataneo, his principal follower, and put the Chevalier Pezare in his place. The Venetian took no notice of his friend the Frenchmen. Gauttier burst out, declaimed loudly against the treachery and abused friendship of his former comrade, and instantly earned the devotion of Catanao and his friends. The physician swore on his life faithfully to serve the pretty couple, and was delighted to know she would be served as a queen should be--a rare thing. The queen would not consent to have him, because he was so ungallant. The king loved Montsoreau for his great wisdom, but he was not allowed to be king.. The king was a shrewd man, and well suited to govern states. He worked wonders in Sicily, repaired the ports, brought merchants there. His Court was the most renowned in the countries of Europe. The one looked after the pleasures, and was himself the delight of the queen, whose face was always bright and gay, because she was served according to the method of Touraine. He also took care to keep the king amused, finding him every day new mistresses, and casting him into a whirl of dissipation. This fine political aspect was the result of the perfect agreement of the two men who thoroughly understood each other. The king was much envied, and the happiest king in the Christian world, because through these things his court was themost renowned in Europe. He was also the happiest man in the world, and his Court was his most renowned.. The king was much astonished at the good temper of the queen, whom, since the arrival of the Sire de Montsoreau in the island, he had touched no more than a Jew touches bacon. The state of things lasted three years, some say four, but the monks of Saint Benoist have not wormed out the date, which remains obscure. Probably the Venetian had the high ambition to reign without any control or dispute, and forgot the services which the Frenchman had rendered him. Thus do the men who live in Courts behave, for, according to the statements of the Messire Aristotle in his works, that which ages the most rapidly in this world is a kindness, although extinguished love is sometimes very rancid. The king and queen abandoned the care of their kingdom to the other friend, who conducted the affairs of government. Leufroid's friend Pezare wanted to get rid of his friend by revealing to the king the mystery of his cuckoldom. He would then deprive Monsoreau of his head, according to a practice common in Sicily under similar circumstances. By this means he would have all the money that he and Gauttier had noiselessly conveyed to the house of a Lombard of Genoa, which money was their joint property on account of their fraternity. This treasure was increased on one side by the magnificent presents made to Montsoreau by the queen, who had vast estates in Spain, and other, by inheritance in Italy. On the other, the king's gifts to his prime minister, to whom. One night that Pezare knew that the queen was in bed with her lover, the traitor promised the king to let him take evidence in the case. The Spanish lady, who was fleet of foot, heard footsteps, peeped out, and perceiving the king, followed by the Venetian, through a crossbar in the closet in which she slept. She ran to warn the couple of this betrayal. The queen had her lover between two sheets, which is certainly the best way to have a lover. The king was a man of awkward manners, and the queen a woman who loved him as though each night were a wedding one. The traitor took care to conceal his intention from Gauttier.. The king was enraged by what he overheard. He found the queen lying on the bed exactly as he has seen her through the hole. The queen sprang up, reddening with shame, and asked what man dared to intrude upon her privacy at such a moment. She said to him as follows:--""Ah! my lord, you have discovered that which I have endeavoured to conceal from you"" The king looked as foolish as a fox caught in a trap. He said to her: ""I am so badly treated by you that I am afflicted with a burning ailment, of which my dignity would not allow me to complain"" The queen replied: ""My dignity wouldn't allow me, but which needs secret dressing in order to assuage the influence of the vital forces"". The queen asked the king to take her to her apartment instead of the poor invalid, who usually did so in order to avoid calumny. When they were in the gallery where the Sire de Montsoreau resided, the queen said jokingly, ""You should play a good trick on this Frenchman, who I would wager is with some lady, and not in his own room"" Leufroid was a Spanish queen of Spanish temperament, whose blood was excessively amorous. He was the son of a Spanish king, and the grandson of a French king. He died in 1701. He is buried in the Cimetière de la Salerno in Paris. The queen is buried next to her husband, in the same room as the physician. She is said to have said: ""To save my honour and your own, I am compelled to come to my good Lady Miraf. The king believed the said termination to this accouchement was caused by the too chaste life the queen had led. He founded the Church of the Madonna, which is one of the finest in the town of Palermo. The queen returned with the king, whom she took to her apartments, and whispered to one of. the guards to send to her the lord whose place Pezare occupied. Then, while she fondled the king,. she took the lord directly he came, into an adjoining room. ""Erect a gallows on the bastion,"" said she, ""then seize the knight, and manage so that he is hanged instantly, without giving time to write or say a single word on any subject whatsoever."" Such is our good pleasure and supreme command,"" said the queen.. The Sire de Monsoreau told him that when a king got his wife from Spain, he ought to know that this queen would require more attention than any other. The good knight came back to Touraine laden with wealth, and lived there many years, but never mentioned his adventures in Sicily. He returned there to aid the king's son in his principal attempt against Naples, and left Italy when this sweet prince was wounded, as is related in the Chronicle. The monkish author of this narrative seems to draw this other no less learned moral therefrom, that interest which makes so many friendships, breaks them also. It is said that fortune, being female, is always on the side of the ladies, and that men are quite right to serve them well. But it shows us that silence is the better part of wisdom.. . It's not a perfect solution, but it's a good one"
0.65,0.75,48.698884758364315,"Louis Lambert was born in Montoire, France. He was the son of a shopkeeper. He read the Old and New Testaments as a child. He became fascinated with the Bible. He wrote a book about the Bible, which was published in 1776. He also wrote a play, which he later turned into a novel. He died in 1852. His son, Louis, is now a well-known author. He is the author of the book, ""The Story of the Bible"" (1876) and ""The Book of Lamentations"" (1776). At that period substitutes for the army were scarce; rich families secured them long beforehand to have them ready when the lots were drawn. The poor tanner's modest fortune did not allow of their purchasing a substitute for their son, and they saw no means allowed by law for evading the conscription but that of making him a priest. So, in 1807. Lambert was educated by Madame de Stael at the college at Vendome. He left his uncle, an old and not uncultured Oratorian, early in 1811 to enter the college. His parents did not want to expose him to the dreadful chances of war. He owed the favor and patronage of this celebrated lady to chance, or shall we not say to Providence, who can smooth the path of forlorn genius? To us, indeed, who do not see below the surface of human things, such vicissitudes, of which we find many examples in the lives of great men, appear to be merely the. Lambert spent his holidays in the woods, reading and meditating. He devoured books of every kind, feeding indiscriminately on religious works, history, philosophy, and physics. He has told me that he found indescribable delight in reading dictionaries for lack of other books. What scholar has not many a time found pleasure in seeking the probable meaning of some unknown word? The analysis of a word, its physiognomy and history, would be to Lambert a matter for long dreaming. He would read and meditate for hours, until his mother would come and stop him.. ""I would travel from Greece to Rome, and traverse the whole extent of modern ages,"" he said. ""I would find on his mistress' lips as much love as he gives,"" he added. ""By their mere physiognomy, words call to life in our brain the beings which they serve to clothe"" ""I am a man of the world,"" he wrote, ""and I will be for ever, as long as I am alive."" ""I will never be a man, but I will always be a boy,"" he continued. ""And I will never cease to be a child of the universe,"" he concluded. ""Because I am a boy, and I am not yet a man."". Louis Lambert's passion for reading had on the whole been very well satisfied. The process of absorbing ideas by means of reading had become in him a very strange phenomenon. His eye took in six or seven lines at once, and his mind grasped the sense with a swiftness as remarkable as that of his eye. Sometimes even one word in a sentence was enough to enable him to seize the gist of the matter. Louis Lambert had assimilated the contents of all the books in his uncle's library that were worth reading. The cure of Mer had two or three thousand volumes. This treasure had been derived from the plunder committed during the Revolution in the neighboring chateaux and abbeys. As a priest who had taken the oath, the. The author had every form of memory. He remembered with equal exactitude the ideas he had derived from reading. He could remember, as he said, not merely the position of a sentence in the book where he had met with it, but the frame of mind he had been in at remote dates. His was the singular privilege of being able to retrace in memory the whole life and progress of his mind. The author's work is published by Simon & Schuster, Inc. in the U.S. and Europe.. ""Whenever I wish it,"" said he to me in his own language, ""I can draw a veil over my eyes"" ""I suddenly see within me a camera obscura, where natural objects are reproduced in purer forms than those first appeared to my external sense"" ""When I read the story of the battle of Austerlitz, I saw every incident,"" he said. ""I saw all things in a way that I could not have imagined."" ""I am the only person who can see what is not visible to me,"" he added. ""And I can see it in a very clear way."" ""The only thing that can stop me from seeing it is that I am not allowed to see it."". ""Our spirit is abysmal and loves the abyss,"" he would say. ""The roar of the cannon, the cries of the fighting men rang in my ears, and made my inmost self quiver"" ""I looked down on the plain where armed nations were in collision, just as if I had been on the heights of Santon,"" he said. ""I could smell the powder; I heard the clatter of horses and the voices of men"" ""The scene was as terrifying as a passage from the Apocalypse,"" he wrote. ""Our spirit was abysmally abysmic and loves to be in the abyss"". ""In childhood, manhood, and old age we are always eager for mysteries in whatever form they present themselves,"" he said. ""This predilection was disastrous,"" he added. ""It was due perhaps to the influence produced on his mind by the first books he read at his uncle's"" ""The Bible and Madame Guyon had the first-fruits of his manly intelligence,"" he wrote.. Louis XIV was a pupil of the Baroness de Stael. She was forbidden to come within forty leagues of Paris. She met a tanner's son, almost in rags, and absorbed in reading. The book was a translation of 'Heaven and Hell' The Baroness was almost the only person in the French Empire to whom the name of 'Swedenborg' was known. She died in 1831. The novel was published in 1832. It was the first novel written by a French woman. It is considered one of the greatest novels of all time. It has been translated into several languages.. ""Do you pray to God?"" said the child. ""Why? yes!"" replied the Baroness. ""And do you understand Him?"" ""Yes, I do"" said the little boy. ""Do you understand?"" "". The Baroness of Stael met Louis Lambert in Paris in 18th century. She was determined to save him from serving the Emperor or the Church. She made him out to be a second Moses snatched from the waters. Louis failed to justify in the eyes of the world the high hopes he had inspired in his protectress. The transient favor she showed him was regarded as a feminine caprice. The only person now living who preserves any recollection of the incident, and whom I catechised to be informed of what few words Madame de Stael had let drop, could with difficulty recall these words spoken by the Baroness as describing Lambert, ""He is a real seer."". Louis Lambert entered Blois College at the age of 14 in 1811. Lambert would leave it at the end of 1814, when he had finished the course of Philosophy. I doubt whether during the whole time he ever heard a word of his benefactress. The circumstances of the time, and Louis Lambert's character, may to a great extent absolve Madame de Stael for her thoughtlessness and her generosity. The political events that ensued were then a sufficient excuse for this gentleman's neglect of the Baroness' protege. The gentleman who was to have kept up communications between her and the boy left Blois just at the time when Louis passed. The Baroness of Corbigny died in 1812. Louis Lambert went to see her on the day of her death. Two letters from Lambert to the Baroness remained unanswered. The Baroness died shortly after. She left a hundred louis in her will to her son-in-law, who died shortly before her death in 1815. Lambert never saw the money. He died shortly afterwards.. Lambert was a member of the Society of Jesus. He was one of the first to be sent to the college. The college was founded by the Jesuits to train up young men for the army. The school was founded to train young men in the arts and sciences. It became a training ground for the young men of France. It was also a place of learning for young men. It is now a museum of French history. The museum is still open today, and is open to the public. It has been open since the beginning of the Revolution.. The college is the most celebrated home of learning in all the central provinces, and receives pupils from them and from the colonies. Once entered there, a pupil never leaves till his studies are finished. Distance prohibits any frequent visits from parents to their children. The rule of the House forbids holidays away from it. The college is located in the heart of the town, on the little river Loire which flows under its walls. It has a chapel, a theatre, an infirmary, a bakehouse, gardens, and water supply.. The School of Jesus was founded by the Society of Jesus in the 16th century. The school was run by a group of monks, and pupils were inspected every Sunday. The tawse was still a living memory, and the classical leather strap played its terrible part with all the honors. The punishment was as alarming to the moral as to the physical man, was still in force in all the integrity of the original code. Letters to parents were obligatory on certain days, so was confession. Everything bore the stamp of monastic rule. We were all in our best, placed in file like soldiers to await the arrival of the two inspectors who, attended by the tutors and the tradesmen,. The school was divided into eight classes. The senior class included philosophy, rhetoric, and higher mathematics. The middle class included the little boys, who were classed as third and fourth. The dining hall was the center of the school, with classrooms and a play area. The boys were allowed to talk at their meals, and exchange plates. If a boy wanted lentils, the offer was passed from hand to hand. The plate of lentils was returned by the same road. Mistakes were never made. The school was a model of discipline. It was a school of learning. It is a school for the future. It will be a model for the world.. The tables were very long; our incessant barter kept everything moving; we transacted it with amazing eagerness. The chatter of three hundred lads, the bustling to and fro of the servants employed in changing the plates, setting down the dishes, handing the bread, made this refectory at Vendome a scene unique in its way. To make our life more tolerable, deprived as we were of all communication with the outer world and of family affection, we were allowed to keep pigeons and to have gardens. Our two or three hundred pigeon-houses, with a thousand birds nesting all round the outer wall, and above thirty garden plots, were a sight. ""For six francs during one night we owned every delight of that inexhaustible shop,"" writes the author. ""During Mass every response we chanted was mixed up in our minds with our secret calculations,"" he adds. ""For six Francs duringOne night we own every delight"" ""For 6 francs during one night, we owned all the delight of the inexhaustable shop!"" says the author, ""for six franc during one night we Owned every delight of that exhaustible shop!"". No young duchess, on her first appearance at Court, was ever more spitefully criticised than the new boy by the youths in his division. No one who forms a clear idea of this huge college, with its monastic buildings in the heart of a little town, will easily conceive of the excitement that we felt at the arrival of a new boy. And which of us but obeyed the instinctive law of social existence by pitying, helping, and despising those pariahs who, by the avarice or poverty of their parents, found themselves penniless? It is a pity to think of them now, and how they must feel.. Louis Lambert's advent was the subject of a romance worthy of the _Arabian Nights_. I was in the fourth class at the time--among the little boys. Our housemasters were two men whom we called Fathers from habit and tradition, though they were not priests. In my time there were indeed but three genuine Oratorians to whom this title legitimately belonged. In 1814 they all left the college, which had gradually become secularized, to find occupation about the altar in various country parishes, like the cure of Meru. The story of Louis Lambert is told in the novel ""Lambert"" by the French writer.. Louis Lambert was discovered, like an aerolite, by Madame de Stael, in a corner of the wood. All the children came round in silence to hear the story of Louis Lambert. Monsieur Haugoult had to tell us all about Madame deStael. That evening she seemed to me ten feet high. I saw at a later time the picture of Corinne, in which Gerard represents her as so tall and handsome.. Louis was a fourth-class student, but would leap up a class every year. He was one of the ""Academicians"" of Vendome. An Academician was a great man in embryo, writes Louis. Louis' ignorance of Latin placed him so low as the fourth class, but he would certainly leap up every year, he writes.. It was very unusual to be one of that illustrious body before attaining to the second class. The Academicians were expected to hold public meetings every Thursday during the holidays. I long treasured the memory of a story called the ""Green Ass,"" which was, I think, the masterpiece of this unknown Society. Louis Lambert bewildered all our ideas. This boy of fourteen, a poet already, the protege of Madame de Stael, a coming genius, said Father Haugoult. A wizard, a youth capable of writing a composition or a translation while we were being called into lessons, and of learning his lessons by reading them through but once.. ""Oh, I wish I might be his chum!"" cried an enthusiast. Father Haugoult's curiosity and impatience to see this new boy added fuel to our excited fancy. It is strange, but never in my time did I know brothers who were chums. In school language, the word here rendered chum--_faisant_ or in some schools, _copin_--expressed a fraternal sharing. The word in itself has no final meaning; we affect a word more than it affects us. If man lives by his feelings, he thinks perhaps that he will make his life the poorer if he merges an affection of his own choosing in a natural tie. We affect a term in relation to the images we have assimilated and grouped round it. The word has no meaning in itself, but its value is in relation. to the image we have. The meaning of a word is that we affect it in a way that we can't explain.. Lambert and Dufaure were the only two scholars of Vendome. They were brought together in the same classroom, on the same form, and under the same roof. Lambert's precocious gifts were overwhelming to Duf aure, who was jealous of his place as leader. The two were the first to discuss the nature of the human mind and the origin of consciousness. The book was published in 1842. It was published by the publisher, Le Monde, in Paris. It is published by Barchou de Penhoen, at a cost of £20,000.. The poet was nicknamed the Poet, but mockery did not cure him. He wrote an epic poem on the Incas, which became famous among his companions. He also wrote a series of children's books, which he later published. He died in Paris, aged 80, after a long battle with cancer. He is survived by his wife, two children, and his mother. He has also written a book about his experiences, ""The Poet's War"" (1962) The book is published by Verso, a French publisher, and is available in English and French. It is available for pre-order now.. ""I was always rhyming, in spite of good advice from"

He says society rewards virtue with an income of a hundred louis in old age, a dwelling on a second floor, bread sufficient, occasional new bandana handkerchiefs, an elderly wife and her offspring. So much for virtue, he writes. But, oh marvel of our civilization! Society rewards virtue by giving it a second-floor apartment and a wife and children. He adds: ""So much for Virtue!"" he says. ""So what?"" he asks. ""It's a marvel of civilization!"". Government levies a conscription on the young intelligence of the kingdom at the age of seventeen or eighteen. Great ability is prematurely exhausted by excessive brain work before it is sent up to be submitted to a process of selection. Nurserymen sort and select seeds in much the same way. Five hundred such heads, set afire with hope, are sent up annually by the most progressive portion of the population. Of these the Government takes one third, puts them in sacks called the coles, and shakes them up together for three years. Though every one of these young plants represents vast productive power, they are made, as one may say, into cashiers. Though each one of them represents vastproductive power, the Government makes them into cashier. They are made to act as cashiers for the Government. The Government works harmoniously with this profoundly illogical. ""If from among this race of dupes there should escape some five or six men of genius who climb the highest heights, is it not miraculous? ""This is an exact statement of the relations between Talent and Probity on the one hand, and Government and Society on the other, in an age that considers itself to be progressive. They receive as the price of their services the third-floor lodging, the wife and family, and all the comforts that sweeten life for mediocrity. ""They receive appointments; the rank and file of engineers is made up of them; they are employed as captains of artillery;. A recent occurrence in Paris would seem improbable. It will perhaps receive some thoughtful attention from minds capable of recognizing the real plague spots of our civilization. Since 1815, our civilization has been moved by the spirit of gain rather than by principles of honor. The bank was robbed by a group of young men. The robbers were not caught until the police arrived and arrested them. They were arrested on suspicion of embezzling money from a bank. The men were later released and the money was returned to the bank's owners. The incident took place in the early hours of the morning on a dull autumn day. The thieves were arrested and the case was later solved. The case was the first of its kind in France. The French government has been investigating the case since.. The safe of hammered iron is so enormously heavy that burglars could not carry it away. The door only opened at the pleasure of those who knew its password. The letter-lock was a warden who kept its own secret and could not be bribed. The mysterious word was an ingenious realization of the ""Open sesame!"" in the _Arabian Nights_. But even this was as nothing. The wives of the partners in the firm were expecting their lovers; the two bankers dining with their mistresses. Everything was in order.. The door of the room was lined with sheet iron a third of an inch in thickness, concealed behind the thin wooden paneling. A man might discover the password; but unless he knew the lock's final secret, the gold-guarding dragon of mechanical science, it discharged a blunderbuss at his head. If ever man could feel confident that he was absolutely alone, and that there was no remote possibility of being watched by prying eyes, that man was the cashier of the house of Nucingen and Company in the Rue Saint-Lazare. Accordingly the deepest silence prevailed in that iron cave. The shutters had been closed, the door had been shut. The fire had. The brain that gives off the largest quantity of nitrogen asphyxiates the others, in the long run. The stove is a mesmerist that plays no small part in the reduction of bank clerks and porters to a state of idiocy. (See _Les Employs_.) The mephitic vapors in the atmosphere of a crowded room contribute in no small degree to bring about a gradual deterioration of intelligences. The power of strong men is evaporated, where their vitality is exhausted, and their wills enfeebled. Government offices are part of a great scheme for the manufacture of the mediocrity necessary for the maintenance of a Feudal System on a pecuniary basis--and money is the foundation.. M. de Nucingen, who had been a contractor before he became a banker, had reason in those days to know the honorable disposition of his cashier, who then occupied a high position. Reverses of fortune had befallen the major, and the banker out of regard for him paid him five hundred francs a month. M. deNucingen was a thrifty and upright human being, sufficient of the philosopher or of the aristocrat to wear shabby clothes. But, unluckily, it is easy to find penny-wise people who will prove weak, wasteful, or incompetent in the capital things of life. The banker paid the major five thousand francs per month, but he died in a car accident.. The author is a former French banker. He was a friend of the banker, who had a private office behind his hotel. The baron had access to it by means of a secret staircase. The room was used to discuss matters of business and to make notes. The author was a member of the bank's board of directors. He is the author of the novel ""The Secret of the Banker's Daughter"" (1834) and the novel The Secret of The Banker’s Daughter (1835) (both are published by Simon & Schuster). The novel is based on a novel by the same name, written in 1834, about the life of a French banker, Jean-Baptiste de Castanier. The novel was written by the French author, who was also a friend and colleague of the baron.. The forger saw a man standing at the little grated window of the counting-house. The man's breathing was so noiseless that he did not seem to breathe at all. Castanier looked, and saw that the door at the end of the passage was wide open; the stranger must have entered by that way. For the first time in his life the old soldier felt a sensation of dread that made him stare open-mouthed and wide-eyed at the man before him. The forger felt that he was being watched. He felt that the man was watching him. He was being observed by a man who was looking at him. CastAnier felt that this man was looking in at him, and that he had been watching him for some time.. The rounded forehead, the harsh coloring of the long oval face, indicated quite as plainly as the cut of his clothes that the man was an Englishman. The intolerable glitter of the stranger's eyes produced a vivid and unpleasant impression, which was only deepened by the rigid outlines of his features. The dried-up, emaciated creature seemed to carry within him some gnawing thought that consumed him and could not be appeased. He must have digested his food so rapidly that he could doubtless eat continually without bringing any trace of color into his face or features. He was a man of the country, not of the world. He had no right to be there. He should have gone home. But he had no choice.. The Englishman smiled. That smile frightened Castanier. No words could have replied more fully nor more peremptorily than that scornful and imperial curl of the stranger's lips. The amount is for five hundred thousand francs. You have the money there, and I must have it. The safe is closed. The counting-house is open. The money is in the safe. But how did you come in, sir?"" ""I have come to cash this bill of exchange, sir,"" he said. ""To-morrow is Sunday, andI cannot wait. The cash is there."" ""But how did I come in?"" ""The safe isclosed"". Baron de Nucingen's signature was forged on the letter of credit. The stranger wrote John Melmoth on the slip of paper and returned it to the cashier. Castanier took up fifty packets, each containing ten thousand francs in bank notes, and held them out to the stranger, receiving in exchange for them a bill accepted by the Baron de N reducingen. The Baron of Nucinge was a French aristocrat.. Castanier looked at the handwriting, noticing that it sloped from right to left in the Eastern fashion, and Melmoth disappeared so noiselessly. When Castanier looks up again an exclamation broke from him, partly because the man was no longer there, partlyBecause he felt a strange painful sensation such as our imagination might take for an effect of poison. He felt the same sickening heat through him that an emetic produces. But it seemed impossible to CastAnier that the Englishman should have guessed his crime.. ""If that brute had come round to see my gentlemen to-day, my goose would have been cooked!"" said Castanier. He put the bill that he meant to take with him in an envelope, and helped himself to five hundred thousand francs in French and English bank notes from the safe. Then he put everything in order, lit a candle, blew out the lamp, took up his hat and umbrella, and went out sedately, as usual, to leave one of the two keys of the strong room.. ""Madame, will you be so good as to tell your husband that the bill of exchange on Watschildine, which was behind time, has just been presented? The five hundred thousand francs have been paid; so I shall not come back till noon on Tuesday."" ""Good-by, monsieur; I hope you will have a pleasant time,"" replied the old dragoon. He glanced as he spoke at a young man well known in fashionable society. ""Pshaw! impossible; he is too stupid,"" said Madame de Nucingen. ""Stay, though, at four o'clock M. Werbrust's friend came, a young fellow from Messrs. du Tillet & Co., in the Rue Joubert"" ""All right,"" said Castanier, and he hurried away. ""The sickening sensation of heat that he had felt when he took back the pen returned in greater intensity"" ""I have been smoking a pipe here in the doorway ever since four o'tclock,"" said the man, ""and nobody has gone into the bank. ""haven't I taken proper precautions? Let me think! Two clear days, Sunday and Monday, then a day of uncertainty before they begin to look for me"" ""I have a couple of passports and two different disguises; is not that enough to throw the cleverest detective off the scent? On Tuesday morning I shall draw a million francs in London before the slightest suspicion has been aroused."" ""I shall live comfortably in Italy for the rest of my days as the Conte Ferraro. I was alone with him when he died, poor fellow, in the marsh of Zembin, and I shall slip into his skin"" ""Think of an old campaigner like me infatuated enough to tie myself to a petticoat tail!... Why take her? I must leave her behind"". ""You will not take her!"" cried a voice that filled Castanier with sickening dread. ""The devil is in it!"" cried the cashier aloud. ""I know myself--I should be ass enough to go back for her"" ""Shall I take her or leave her?"" ""Nobody knows Aquilina?"" ""Yes, I could make up my mind to it"" ""Yes,"" said Castaner, ""but I should be asses enough to do it."" ""I will go back and get her,"" said the man. ""But I will not leave her behind."" ""Yes. I will go and find her."" ""No, I won't."" ""What will you do?"" ""I'll go and look for her."". The letter of credit was drafted in such terms that immediately on his arrival he might draw twenty-five thousand pounds on the firm of Watschildine. The London house had been already advised of the draft about to be made upon them. He had instructed an agent to take his passage in a vessel which was to leave Portsmouth with a wealthy English family on board, who were going to Italy. The passage money had been paid in the name of the Conte Ferraro. He arranged matters so as to divert the search that would be made for him into Belgium and Switzerland, while he himself was at sea in the English vessel. The smallest details of the scheme had been thought out. He was a man as great in crime as he could have been in virtue. For him, as for many men of mixed character in whom weakness and strength are equally blended, the least trifling consideration determines whether they shall continue to lead blameless lives.. ""Pshaw!"" he said at last, at the corner of the Boulevard and the Rue Montmartre. ""I will take a cab after the play this evening and go out to Versailles. A post-chaise will be ready for me at my old quartermaster's place"" He would keep my secret even if a dozen men were standing ready to shoot him down, he said. ""He would keep his secret evenif a dozen people were ready to kill him"" ""He could not sully his life without a pang"" ""His life was stainless as yet; he could notsully it without a grieve"" ""I am not a man of the world. I am a person of the camp."" ""He is not a person. He is a man who is a prisoner of war"". ""You will not go!"" exclaimed the Englishman, and the strange tones of his voice drove all the cashier's blood back to his heart. The chances are all in my favor, so far as I see, so I shall take my little Naqui with me, and I will go,"" said Melmoth. ""If I were fool enough to believe in God, I should think that He had set Saint Michael on my tracks,"" said Castanier. ""Well, upon my word, there is something supernatural about this!"" said he to himself. ""I should think he. Castanier's past life is told in this account. He was a Piedmontese woman who was driven by dire misery to become a prostitute. She was a young woman known in the quarter as Mme. de la Garde. No one, not even Castanier, knew her real name. She lived on the second floor of a block of buildings which looked out upon some gardens. She said that she was one of those young girls who are driven to a trade which most of them loathe, many regard with indifference, and some few follow in obedience to the laws of their constitution. A concise history of certain events in the cashier's. past life must be given in order to explain these facts, and to give a. complete presentment of the crisis when he yielded to temptation.. Castanier was struck by the beauty of the poor child who had drifted by chance into his arms. His determination to rescue her from the life of the streets was half benevolent, half selfish. Social conditions mingle elements of evil with the promptings of natural goodness of heart. So he concluded to be a philanthropist on either count, and at first made her his mistress. But he soon realised that she was not his mistress, and that he should not have taken her in the first place. He then decided to make her his wife, and they had a happy marriage for some years. But then he decided that he was not a good man and that she should be taken away. He said: ""Hey! hey!"" he said to himself, in his soldierly fashion, ""I am an old wolf, and a sheep shall not make a fool of me"". The Piedmontese are considered to be among those which the world declines to recognize. Castanier's wife took the name of Mme. de la Garde, in order to approach, as closely as Parisian usages permit, the conditions of a real marriage. She fancied that she resembled the courtesan in face and general appearance, and in a certain precocity of heart and brain of which she was conscious. When she found that her life was as well regulated and virtuous as was possible for a social outlaw, he manifested a desire that they should live as husband and wife. He said, ""Before you set up housekeeping, reconnoiter the girl's character for a bit, and see if she is a steady sort."" The Piedmonese were considered to have a status the most nearly approaching respectability among those who the world declined to recognize. ""So you do not love me well enough to marry me?"" she said. Mme.Castanier did not answer; he was absorbed by his thoughts. Naqui's heart softened toward him at the sight of his trouble. She tried to soothe him, but what could she do when she did not know what ailed him? The cashier dolefully confessed to the existence of a M. Castanier. The ex-dragoon was in despair. The woman who is a wife in all but name is a pirate and an outlaw for lack of a document. But society, incorrigible as ever, will assuredly persist in regarding the married woman as a corvette duly authorized.. The story of a soldier who married a woman he met at a party in Nancy. He wrote to her twice a year, but no one suspected that he was married. He was a victim of the wiles of mothers with daughters left too long on their hands. The story is familiar to many military men who may chance to be in a like predicament. It is also a good story for those who want to know more about the history of the French Revolution. The French Revolution was fought over the right of the people to vote for the French to be allowed to keep their vote. The right to vote was reserved for the people, not for the politicians, and the right to a vote for a man to be a soldier was not granted. The vote was a right that should be given to the man who had the most votes.. A scheme for inveigling the gallant captain into matrimony was immediately set on foot, one of those schemes by which mothers secure accomplices in a human heart by touching all its motive springs. All the wires which could be pulled to induce action on the captain's part were tried. Unluckily, he had praised the daughter to her mother when he brought her back after a waltz, a little chat followed, and then an invitation in the most natural way in the world. The ladies press everything into the service of their great project, slowly elaborating their toils, much as the ant-lion excavates its funnel in the sand and lies in wait at the bottom for its victim. But if any heedless creature once enters in, it never comes out.. The dragoon was dazzled by the hospitality of a family who appeared to conceal their real wealth beneath a show of careful economy. He was skillfully flattered on all sides, and everyone extolled for his benefit the various treasures there displayed. The dragoon received fifteen thousand francs with the lady, who, after two years of marriage, became the ugliest and consequently the most peevish woman on earth. Luckily they had no children. The lady was later to become the most beautiful woman in the world, and the dragoon the most handsome man in the whole of France. The story was told in a play called ""The Dragoon's Wife"". The fair complexion (maintained by a Spartan regimen) became overspread with blotches and pimples. The angel became a suspicious and shrewish creature who drove Castanier frantic. At length the dragoon, no longer recognizing the woman whom he had wedded, left her to live on a little property at Strasbourg. She was one of those virtuous women who, for want of other occupation, would weary the life out of an angel with complainings. They pray till (if their prayers are heard in heaven) they must exhaust the patience of the Almighty. They say everything that is bad of their husbands in dove-like murmurs over a game of boston. Mme. de la Garde was disinterested. She asked neither for gold nor for jewelry, gave no thought to the future, lived entirely for the present and for the pleasures of the present. She accepted expensive ornaments and dresses, the carriage so eagerly coveted by women of her class, as one harmony the more in the picture of life. There was absolutely no vanity in her desire not to appear at a better advantage but to look the fairer. No woman could live without luxuries more cheerfully. When a man of gener is married to a woman of a different class, he is not so free from the temptations of luxury."

They were carrying with them gold or precious things to purchase absolution, pay for their beds, and present to the saints. Those who drank water going, on their return, if the landlords gave them water, wished it to be the holy water of the cellar. The three pilgrims came to this saidAvignon to their injury, seeing that it was widowed of the pope. They died in a car accident. The pope was killed in a plane crash in Rome in March 15, 1562.. Three pilgrims, one of whom had with him a son about 10 years of age, parted company with the others, and near the town of Milan suddenly appeared again, but without the boy. They had a hearty feast in order to celebrate the return of the pilgrim, who they thought had become disgusted with penitence through the pope not being in Avignon. Of these three roamers to Rome, one had come from the city of Paris, the other from Germany, and the third, who doubtless wished to instruct his son on the journey, had his home in. Three pilgrims met in a hostelry and agreed to journey to Rome together. After drinking the three companions commenced to talk together, for the bottle is the key of conversation. Each made this confession--that the cause of his pilgrimage was a woman. The servant who watched their drinking, told them that of a hundred pilgrims who stopped in the locality, ninety-nine were travelling from the same thing. These three wise men then began to consider how pernicious is woman to man. The Baron showed the heavy gold chain that he had in his hauberk to present to Saint Peter, and said his crime was such that he would not get rid of with the value of two such chains.. The pilgrims said that they had made a solemn vow in their minds never to go astray again during the remainder of their days. The servant exclaimed that their sins must have been as great as those of Visconti. The Burgundian added, that this vow had been the cause of his lagging behind, because he had been in extreme fear that his son, in spite of his age, might going astray. The Parisian took off his glove, and exposed a ring set with a white diamond, saying that he had a hundred like it for the pope. The pilgrim said that he would rather have left them round his wife's neck than those of Notre-Dame-de-Lorette.. The baron inquired the particulars of the adventure, the sire narrated the affair as follows. The Countess Jeane d'Avignon made formerly a law for the harlots. She compelled them to live in houses with window-shutters painted red and closed. The danger was such for anyone unacquainted with the business that if a novice entered, flying chancres and other wild beasts would seize upon his face. The baron told him that young lads had nothing to do with such places, and could only enter them at the peril of their lives. The lad followed me to the hostelry in a state of agitation, and not daring to cast his eyes upon the said bordels.. ""My son went off like a robber, and the servant was unable to tell me what had become of him"" ""Then he began to moan and cry. I told him that if he would confess all that had happened to him I would let him off the beating"" ""I took care not to go in, because of the flying chancres and other wild beasts"" 'I'll give you a taste of the whip,' said I, 'I've got the whip for you' 'I'm not afraid of the wenches, I'm just afraid of my son'. ""These children often make these sort of answers,"" said the Parisian. ""One of my neighbour's children revealed the cuckoldom of his father by a reply"" ""I saw,' said he, 'a fine woman just being finished, because she only wanted one peg, which a young worker was fitting in with energy"" ""Have your supper,"" said I; and the same night I returned into Burgundy, and left him with his mother, being sorely afraid that at the first town he might want to fit a peg into some girl"" ""One day I asked, to see if he was well instructed at school in religious matters, 'What. In this Noel is stated that the Lord God, having turned his head to look at a donkey, who had brayed for the first time in his Paradise, while he was manufacturing Eve, the devil seized this moment to put his finger into this divine creature. The Lord took care to close with a stitch, from which comes the maid. By means of this frenum, the woman should remain closed, and children be made in the same manner in which God made the angels, by a pleasure far above carnal pleasure as the heaven is above the earth. In this Noel, which in my country we call a Noel, lies the reason of imperfection of this feature of women, of which, different to that of other females, no man can slake the thirst.. The servant declared that they were quite correct in the statements, for that woman was a bad animal. The pilgrims, noticing then how pretty the girl was, were afraid of breaking their vows, and went straight to bed. From this came the first sin and the sorrows of the human race, because God, noticing the devil's work, determined to see what would come of it. Thus these two productions of the devil had the desire to reunite themselves, following the law of similarities which God had laid down for the conduct of the world. ""Ah!"" said the landlady, ""what matters it to me the thoughts my customers have in their brains, so long as their purses are well filled."". The three women were in bed with a man who had promised to leave them alone. The man said that if they had spoken so severely of women it was because they had not known those of them. The woman said that she would not leave the man alone, even if he were to leave her. The three women then went to bed and slept. The next day they were in the same bed with the man, who had left them with the ring and the earrings. They were in a state of undress. The men were in their early 20s and had not yet been married. The women had been in bed for a month. The night before they were to go to bed, the man said: ""I will leave you to sleep. I'll. The Citizen of Paris came back full of stories for his wife, and found her full of Hope. The Burgundian saw Madame de La Vaugrenand so troubled that he nearly died of the"
0.46,0.56,39.212070410729254,"Anseau was a silversmith from Tours. He was a citizen of Paris and subject of the king, whose protection he bought. He had a house built for him free of all quit-rent, close to the Church of St. Leu, in the Rue St. Denis, where his forge was well-known by those in want of fine jewels. He later returned to his own country and was mayor of St Martin, according to the chronicles of the abbey of that town.. The story of a Touranian silversmith who kept himself virtuous as a true saint. He came into the town on foot, poor as Job, according to the old saying. He had a character of iron, and persevered in the path he had chosen as steadily as a monk in vengeance. As a workman, he laboured from morn to night, always learning new secrets, seeking new receipts, and meeting with inventions of all kinds.. Poverty engendered hard work, hard work engendered his wonderful virtue, and his virtue engendered great wealth. Take this to heart, ye children of Cain who eat doubloons and micturate water. If the good silversmith felt himself possessed with wild desires, which now in one way, now another, seize upon an unhappy bachelor when the devil tries to get hold of him, the Touranian hammered away at his metal.. Parisians had taught him to walk uprightly, not to beat the bush for others, to measure his passions by the rule of his revenues. He knew well his mother's Latin, and spoke it correctly without waiting to be asked. His voice was as gentle as that of a bridegroom before marriage. And so he did, without troubling anyone else, without bothering anyone else. He had as much wisdom as he had need of to do business comfortably and pleasantly.. ""By my faith, I should like to be this jeweller, even were I obliged to splash myself up to the eyes with the mud of Paris during a hundred years for it"" ""He was, in fact, a man made with one stroke, and they are the best"" ""Those who have to be touched are worth nothing, being patched up and finished at odd times"" ""I am not a man, I am a woman."". Master Anseau was a thorough man, with a lion's face, and under his eyebrows a glance that would melt his gold if the fire of his forge had gone out. A limpid water placed in his eyes by the great Moderator of all things tempered this. ""The vocation of a lover is to go, to come, to listen, to watch, to hold his tongue, to talk, to stick in a corner, to make himself big,"" he writes. ""To count the gray peas in the dovecote, to find flowers under the snow, to say paternosters to the moon,"" he adds. ""You have good looks, and will yet write the epitaph of the human race,"" he says of his. The writer was speaking to a group of young men in London. He was talking about the role of a good-tempered man in a relationship with a woman. He said that if a man failed to do the one thing that pleases his lady above all others, she would leave him like a red leper. The author said that the woman was right to leave him, and that no-one can blame her for doing so. He added that some men become ill- tempered, cross, and more wretched than you can imagine.. The employment of a lover is that of a mountebank, a soldier, a quack, of a buffoon, a prince, a ninny, a king, of an idler, a monk, and a dupe. It is a vocation in which a man of worth is required to spend above all things, his time, his life, his blood, his best words, besides his heart, his soul, and his brain. Have not many of them killed themselves through this pettico. Parisian women receive more wit at their baptism than in any other place in the world, and thus are mischievous by birth. But our silversmith, always busy at his work, burnishing gold and melting silver, had no time to warm his love or to burnish and make shine his fantasies, nor to show off, gad about, waste his time in mischief, or to run after she-males. Now seeing that in Paris virgins do not fall. Touranian was a poet and a lover of jewels. He was a restless cuckoo. He wanted to take a wife but was too restless to do so. He died in a car crash in the Alps.. ""She would keep the house tidy, keep the plates hot for me, fold the clothes for me,"" he says. ""Every one in the quarter will think of my wife and then of me, and say 'There's a happy man' He would buy her beautiful mirrors, and there would always be a dozen or so of children, his and hers, when he came home to greet him"" ""Then wife and children would vanish into the clouds,"" he adds.. The silversmith was a man of great talent, but his art became disordered. He would have quitted this world without knowing what love was, but would have known it in the other without that metamorphosis of the flesh which spares it. May the great devil give them a clyster with his red-hot three- pronged fork. But, there! these preparatory digressions are the idle digression and fastidious commentaries which. A silversmith was walking on the left bank of the Seine when he met a girl. She curtsied to him, saying ""Heaven preserve you, monseigneur"" He felt his soul ravished by this feminine melody, and conceived an affection for the girl. But as he had passed the wench by he dared not go back, because he was as timid as a young maid.. ""Monseigneur"" was a master silversmith and a citizen. He thought he could look a woman in the face if his fancy so led him. He came upon the girl, who held by an old cord her poor cow. ""Are you not afraid of being cast into prison?"" he asked her. ""I have nothing to fear, because I belong to the abbey,"" she replied.. ""Ah, monseigneur, our beast is almost the half of our poor lives"" ""The Lord Abbot has given me leave to exercise the cow after vespers"" ""I am astonished, my girl, to. ""Monseigneur, I am the daughter of an homme de corps"" ""And what does this mean?"" he said, wishing to hear all about it. ""If he loved me otherwise, his children would still belong to the domain"" ""For this reason I am neglected by everyone, abandoned like a poor beast of the field"" ""What makes me most unhappy is, that according to the pleasure of monseigneur the abbot, I shall be coupled at some time"". ""If I were less ugly than I am, the most amorous would flee from me as from the black plague,"" she said. ""And how old are you?"" asked the silversmith. ""I do not know, monseigneur; but our master, the abbot, has kept account."" ""And make sure that this Joseph suspected the pretty white of this sweet girl's breasts, which were by a modest grace carefully covered with an old rag,"" she added.. The story of a silversmith and a cow. The story is told in the form of a short story by the author. The author describes how he was forbidden to touch the cows. He also describes how the cow gave him a taste of its milk.. ""Nay, my child, I thirst not for milk, but for you, whom I would have leave to liberate"" ""That cannot be, and I shall die the property of the abbey"" ""I would have liked to be able to put this bondswoman into. ""What!"" said the Touranian, ""has no gallant been tempted by your bright eyes to buy your liberty, as I bought mine from the king?"" ""It would cost too dear,"" replied the abbot. ""And you have never thought of gaining another country in company of a lover on horseback on a fleet courser?"". ""I have no name, dear sir. My father was baptised Etienne, my mother is Etienne,. and I am Tiennette, at your service."" ""I believe that I see in you a sign from heaven! And if I am not displeasing to you, I beg you to accept me as your friend."". ""No, monseigneur, I should be the cause of a thousand unpleasantnesses, and of your misfortune,"" said the bondswoman. ""Ho!"" cried Anseau; ""you do not know, my child, the man you are dealing with."" The Touranian crossed himself, joined his hands, and said-- ""I make a vow to Monsieur the Saint Eloi, under whose invocation are the silversmiths"". ""I will love you all my life; but withdraw your vow,"" said the silversmith to the maid. ""Yes,"" said she, ""for I shall be beaten."" The maid was taken by the horns, and held in the grip of the Touranian, who for a trifle would have thrown her in the air, like a straw. ""Adieu, my sweet one! If you go into the. ""Yes, dear Sir. For this I would leap the walls, and, in gratitude, would I be yours without mischief, and cause you no sorrow, at the price of my everlasting future"" ""Make me a promise to be in this field the next Lord's-Day; fail not to come, even should it rain halberds."" ""I will pray God for you with all my heart"" ""I am the most beautiful girl you have ever seen,"" she said.. The abbot was Monseigneur Hugon de Sennecterre, aged ninety-three. He was esteemed by all for his prudence, and loved for his little works and kindnesses. The king's chamberlain promised him assistance, had a horse saddled for himself, and a hack.. The abbot of Hugon was about to sentence a silversmith to death. The chamberlain asked the abbot to emancipate the silverssmith's bondswoman. The abbot refused, saying that the canons had forbidden him to do so. The court was then adjourned until the next day, when the sil. ""Your love is in danger,"" said that chamberlain to the silversmith, pulling him on one side. ""Dismiss this fantasy. You can meet anywhere, even at Court, with women of wealth, young and pretty, who would willingly marry you"" ""The angler has caught us a good fish! This is a grave business, and I know not how to decide by myself."". ""Monseigneur,"" said the silversmith to the abbot, coming towards him, ""you have the charge and office representing here below the goodness of God"" ""Then see if you cannot buy the manumission of this maid. I know the monks. With them money does everything,"" replied the abbott.. ""My son,"" replied the abbot, ""have you lost your senses? If you are so resolved to have this wench for a legal wife, your goods and your person belong to the Chapter of the abbey"" ""Yes, monseigneur, I am passionately in love with this girl, and more touched with her misery and her Christian heart than even with her perfections,"" said he. ""I am still more astonished at your harshness, and I say it although I know that my. ""I am stronger than iron is hard, and more patient than sorrow is great,"" said the abbot. ""You have wrongfully broken my chair, and lightly judged my mind,"" he said. ""I am responsible for this to God and to the abbey,"" he added. ""And your whole abbey could not pay for the special creations which proceed therefrom"" ""I have made you my wife, my children, and my son,"" he replied, ""and I. The silversmith, who was not a great scholar, remained thoughtful. He called upon the king's chamberlain to bear witness to the infinite pains which his majesty takes every day to fight for the establishment of his orders. ""That is to close my mouth,"" said the chamberlain. ""We have treasure wherewith to buy rare jewels, and that no treasure can establish customs and laws"". Tiennette, clean as a new pin, her hair raised up, dressed in a robe of white wool with a blue sash, with tiny shoes and white stockings. So royally beautiful, so noble in her bearing was she, that the silversmith was petrified with ecstasy. The Chapter let the poor lover know that if he married this girl he must resolve to yield up his goods and his house to the abbey, consider himself a bondsman.. The silversmith, to whom everyone spoke of the cupidity of the monks, saw clearly that the abbot would incommutably maintain this order. He determined to carry off the girl, and fly with her into her a sure place from which nothing could draw him. But without his abbot, for going to the meadows, he found Tiennette no more there, and learned that she was confined in the abbey.. Master Anseau passed his time in tears, complaints, and lamentations. All the city, the townspeople, and housewives, talked of his adventure. The king sent for the old abbot to court, and demanded of him why he did not yield under the circumstances to the great love of the silversmith. ""Because, monseigneur,"" replied the priest, ""all rights are knit together like the pieces of a coat of mail, and if. Tiennette was a silversmith who lived at the abbey of Toulouse. She was allowed to go into the parlour every day under the control of an old. The two lovers had no other license than to see each other, and to speak to each other. They always grew their love more powerful. The two lovers were in love with each other for years. The lovers were lovers for years, and always grew more powerful for their love. They were lovers because they were lovers, and because they loved each other so much. The love was so strong that the lovers were always in love for each other; they were also in love because they could not snatch the smallest atom of pleasure."

I was born at the home of a parson in Catshire, near the little town of Miaulbury. My mother's fecundity condemned nearly all her infants to a cruel fate. The cause of the maternal intemperance of English cats has not yet been decided. Toms and females each insist it is due to their own amiability and respective virtues. But impertinent observers have remarked that Cats in England are required to be so boringly proper that this is their only distraction. Others pretend that herein may lie concealed great questions of commerce and politics, having to do with the English rule of India, but these matters are not for my paws to write of and I leave them to the Edinburgh-Review. I was not drowned with the others on account of the whiteness of my robe. Also I was named Beauty also I was name Beauty.. An elderly female noticed that I had an affection for the parson's Bible. She believed, perhaps, that I belonged to the sect of sacred animals which had already furnished the she-ass of Balaam, and took me away with her. I was only two months old at this time. This old woman, who gave evenings for which she sent out cards inscribed Tea and Bible, tried to communicate to me the fatal science of the daughters of Eve. Her method, which consisted in delivering long lectures on personal dignity and on the obligations due the world, was a very successful one. In order to avoid these lectures one submitted to martyrdom. One morning I, a poor little daughter of Nature, attracted by a bowl of cream, covered by a muffin, knocked the muffin off with my paw, and lapped the cream. Then in joy, and perhaps also on account of the weakness of my young organs, I delivered myself on the waxed floor to the imperious need. ""Permit me to give you a lesson in gentility,"" she said. ""Understand, Miss Beauty, that English Cats veil natural acts, which are opposed to the laws of English respectability"" ""The greatest privilege of Cats is to depart with the grace that characterizes your actions, and let no one know where you are going to make your little toilets,"" she added. ""Deceived by appearances, everybody will take you for an angel,"" she concluded. ""Learn to suffer a thousand deaths rather than reveal your desires,"" she told him. ""In this suppression consists the virtue of the saints."" ""I am a woman, and I will be a lady,"" he replied. ""I will be the queen of the world,"" she replied.. ""Once alone, and sure of not being seen by anybody, well, Beauty, you can sacrifice respectability with much more charm because you have been discreet in public,"" said the old woman. ""In the future when such a desire seizes you, look out of the window, give the impression that you desire to go for a walk, then run to a copse or to the gutter,"" she said. ""I found much hypocrisy in this doctrine, but I was so young!"" said the Cat of good sense. ""It seemed preferable to understand that exterior propriety was all that was demanded of an English Cat,"" he added. ""This world being, alas, only illusion and deception."" ""I admit that these disguises were revolting to all my animal good sense, but on account of the whipping, it seemed preferable,"" he said.. ""I was regarded as the pearl of Cats. I was a fool, a son of a rich landowner,"" he said. ""I explained all animal actions by religious theories"" He said he was a ""stupid man"" who was waiting for a bequest. "". Cats are not allowed to wet their fur, which is the reason for their fashion of drinking. The cat was so well-bred that she could be held without fear for her dress. The Cat was bored, so she lapped her milk from a saucer. She was also aware that a young female Cat of the neighbourhood had run away with a Tom. The Cats are not understood by the savants who are more preoccupied in showing their own wit, than in discovering ours. The cats are very intelligent, but they are not very good at socialising. They are not good at playing. They can't play with other cats. They don't like to play with each other. They're not very social. They like to drink milk from saucers. They love to lick the edges of the saucer and gradually diminish the circle of fluid.. ""Beauty is entirely moral; she is a little angel,"" she said. ""Although she is very beautiful she has the air of not knowing it"" ""She never looks at anybody, which is the height of a fine aristocratic education"" ""Give her a ring and she will not keep it"" 'She is simple, without affectation, and has no desire for jewels' 'She loves tea, sits, gravely calm, while the Bible is being explained' 'Nobody ever sees her eat, and certainly that monster of a Lord Byron would have adored her' 'This word, Tom, caused my soul a suffering which nothing could alleviate, not even the compliments I received, or rather that my mistress lavished on herself' 'I am not a man, I am a woman, and a woman is a woman'. ""What these men and old women call education is the custom of dissimulating natural manners,"" he writes. ""When they have completely depraved us they say that we are well-bred"" ""I heard Toms sing hymns to their mates, and these adorable elegies made me feel ashamed of the hypocrisies my mistress had forced upon me"" ""She loves her home and remains there so perfectly tranquil that at times you would believe that she was a mechanical Cat made at Birmingham or Manchester,"" he adds. ""I at last knew what the roof was. I at last known what the Roof was."" ""I received some raps on the head while she received compliments. I was revolted by this sovereign injustice and ran away to the garret"" ""You can't be a man and a woman if you don't have a sense of. ""When will some one serenade me?"" I asked myself. The aspect of these haughty Toms, their melodies, that the human voice could never hope to rival, had moved me profoundly. But an event of tremendous importance was about to occur which tore me violently from this innocent life. I went to London with a niece of my mistress, a rich heiress who adored me, who kissed me, caressed me with a kind of madness, and who pleased me so much that I became attached to her, against all the habits of our race. We were never separated and I was able to observe the great world of London during the season. But these calineries were a pure waste of time. I was never separated from her and we were never together again. I am now in a new life, and I am a happy and contented cat. I have a new home and a new friend. I hope to write a book.. Arabella, my mistress, was a young person like many others in England. She was not sure whom she wanted for a husband. The absolute liberty that is permitted girls in choosing a husband drives them nearly crazy, especially when they recall that English custom does not sanction intimate conversation after marriage. ""Marry a bow-legged man! Never!"" she said of one of the men she met. Every one of them believed that he was going to marry this beautiful girl, but when an affair threatened to terminate in wedlock, she would find some pretext for a break. I was far from dreaming that the London Cats had adopted this severity, that the English laws would be cruelly applied to me, and that I would be a victim of the court at the terrible Doctors' Commons. It was there that I studied the perversity of English manners, which have power even over the beasts, that I became. Puff, with a black coat, had the most magnificent eyes, green and yellow, but cold and proud. Perhaps he came from the imperial house of Austria, because, as you see, he wore the colours. His manners were those of a Cat who had seen the court and the great world. To sum up, he was so remarkably handsome that he had been, it was said, caressed by the Queen of England. ""As to that little fellow he is snub-nosed."" Men were all so much alike to me that I could not understand this uncertainty founded on purely physical differences. ""You have a beautiful Cat. She resembles you. She is white, she is young, she should have a husband"" ""Let me bring her a magnificent Angora that I have at home."" ""As for that little Fellow he isSnub-Nosed"". Puff was the richest kind of catch for a Cat born at a parson's. He had two valets in his service; he ate from Chinese porcelain, and he drank only black tea. He drove in a carriage in Hyde Park and had been to parliament. His weight, that men admired, interfered with his movements. Such was the true reason for his not responding to my pleasant advances. He sat on his unnamable, agitating his beard, looking at me and at times closing his eyes. During the night I heard a concert in the street. Accompanied by my lord, who, according to his taste, walked slowly, I descended. Unknown to me, all the feline population of London learned that Miss Beauty from Catshire had married Puff, marked with the colours of Austria. I then perceived that this English Cat Peer owed this forced and fictitious gravity that in England is called respect. The Ratophile Society was formed by Cats of the Peerage. The English Cats were already preaching the doctrines of the Society, based on the hygienic discoveries of science. When Rats and Mice were dissected little distinction could be found between them and Cats. The oppression of one race by the other then was opposed to the Laws of Beasts, which are stronger even than the laws of Men. ""They are our brothers,"" said a grey Cat, ""and we are their brothers"" The Ratophile society was formed, for the glory of the country, a Temperance Society. It was then the special duty of the English, who could go from one end of the world to the other on their ships without fear of the sea, to spread the principles of the morale ratophile. The Society was called the Ratophile and Temperance Club. It is now a very successful organisation. It has a number of members, including the Cats of the Peerage.. ""I was told that if the Cats would eat no more, Rats would be England's best product"" ""I burst into tears. And he said that the alliance between morality and trade was the only alliance on which England really counted"" ""He was treated as a radical and a dreamer. He appeared to me to be too good a man to make a satisfactory husband."" ""I thought that he was too good to be a man, but he was a man of the people."" ""He said that he would not be a good husband if he did not help the poor."" ""And I said that I would not help him if I did not do anything to help the rich and poor"" ""And he said he would help them. And I said I would do nothing to the poor and the poor"". ""We are here in the interests of the Cats of England, not in those of continental Cats!"" cried a fiery Tory Tom. Puff went to sleep. Just as the assembly was breaking up a young Cat from the French embassy, whose accent proclaimed his nationality, addressed me these delicious words: ""Dear Beauty, it will be an eternity before Nature forms another Cat as perfect as you"" The cashmere of Persia and the Indies is like camel's hair when it is compared to your fine and brilliant silk. A fisherman would search in vain in the depths of Ormus for pearls of the quality of your teeth. Your dear face, fine and gracious, is the loveliest that England has produced. Near to your celestial robe the snow of the Alps would seem to be red. There is not a rose in England as rose as the rose flesh which borders your little rose mouth.. ""I was weary of the solemnity of English Cats, and of their purely practical propriety. Their respectability, especially, seemed ridiculous to me. The excessive naturalness of this badly groomed Cat surprised me in its violent contrast to all that I had seen in London"" ""No Cat ever moved more delicately. Ah! those coats which are only to be seen in your fogs! Softly and gracefully your paws bear your body which is the culmination of the miracles of creation"" ""Come away from this old fool of a Puff, who sleeps like an English Peer in parliament, who besides is a scoundrel who has sold himself to the Whigs, and who, owing to a too long sojourn at Bengal, has lost everything that can please a Cat"" ""I have never seen such an exquisite curve, more correct roundness. Yes! never was there such a fine roundness in your tail."". Brisquet was a French Cat. He was from Mironton, a country where the inhabitants consoled themselves for the victories of the greatest English general by these words: Miront on, ton, ton. He ran away with little bounds, returned, leaping the width of the street, then jumped back again. He remained behind, more surprised than ever because he considered himself handsome. I learned later that it was an easy matter for him to seduce most Cats. I gave no sign of having listened to this declaration, and my apparent insensibility petrified Brisquet. I knew so well what I had to count on for the rest of my days, that I welcomed the promise of the unexpected in the physiognomy of thisFrench Cat.. A true Englishman would have been decent enough not to let me see how he felt, writes Puff. We ate only chicken bones, fishbones, cream, milk, and chocolate. He slept from seven in the evening at the whist table on the knees of his Grace. Puff's mistress sent for a physician who had graduated at Edinburgh after having studied a long time in Paris. Having diagnosed my malady he promised my mistress that he would cure me the next day. He returned, as a matter of fact, and took an instrument of French manufacture out of his pocket. I felt a kind of fright on perceiving a barrel of white metal terminating in a slender tube. I was very ill with a condition aggravated by a little affection of the intestines occasioned by pure herring oil (the Port Wine of English Cats), which Puff used, and which made me very ill.. The Duke of Cambridge was a keen admirer of the calomel. He was told by a doctor that the French used it to cure their patients. The doctor said that a true English physician should cure his patients only with the old English remedies. The physician, who was beginning to make a big reputation, lost all his practice in the great world. He died in a car crash in London in 1841. The story of the Calomel was told in a play by Molière, ""Molière's Calomels"" The play was set in Paris and was directed by Molesworth. The book was published in 1842. The first edition was published by Macmillan, London.. One night I heard the voice of the French Cat in the street. I climbed up the chimney and, appearing on the housetop, cried, ""In the rain-trough!"" This response gave him wings; he was at my side in the twinkling of an eye. Another doctor was called in, who asked me some improper questions about Puff, and who informed me that the real device of the English was: Dieu et mon droit congugal! (pronounced Dieu and Mon droit). I regarded him frigidly and, to give him a lesson, I told him that I belonged to the Temperance Society. I said to him, by your accent and by the looseness of your conversation, that you, like all Catholic Cats, are inclined to laugh and make. ""What new indecency is this?"" I demanded, being well aware that French Cats are very free in their references. He assured me that on the continent everybody, even the King himself, said to his daughter, Ma petite Minette, to show his affection. If I wanted to please him I would call him, Mon petit homme! Then he raised his paws with infinite grace. Thoroughly frightened I ran away"" ""We are always respectable, even in our pleasures."" ""I am not a cat. I am a woman. I have a right to say what I want."" ""You are not a Cat. You are a woman, and I have the right to tell you what I think."" ""If you want to be a Cat, you must be a woman"" ""You can be anything you want. ""Ah! you also are in love, dear Beauty,"" my mistress said to me, observing me extended on the carpet, the paws flat, the body in soft abandon, bathing in the poetry of my memories. I was astonished that a woman should show so much intelligence, and so, raising my dorsal spine, I began to rub up against her legs and to purr lovingly with the deepest chords of my contralto voice. Brisquet was so happy that he sang Rule Britannia, and the next day his dear voice hummed again in my ears. The sly Captain Puck complimented the attaché on his success with me, adding that I had resisted the most charming Toms in England. The next day he sang again in his ears.. Brisquet, foolish, vain Frenchman that he was, responded that he would be happy to gain my attention, but that he had a horror of Cats who spoke to him of temperance, the Bible, etc. The coachman seeing this Frenchman insult me slashed him with his whip. Brisquet was cut but not killed and he received the blow with such nonchalance, continuing to look at me, that I was absolutely fascinated. I loved him for the manner in which he took his punishment, seeing only me, feeling only the favour of my presence, conquering the natural inclination of Cats to flee at the slightest warning of hostility. He could not know that I came near dying, in spite of my apparent coldness. From that moment I made up my mind to elope, and I am still glad I did. I love you, Puck.. ""My dear,"" I asked him, ""have you the capital necessary to pay damages to old Puff?"" ""I have no other capital,"" replied the French Cat, laughing, ""than the hairs of my moustache, my four paws, and this tail"" ""Not any capital,"" I cried, ""but then you are only an adventurer, my dear!"" ""I love adventures,"" he said to me tenderly. ""In France it is the custom to fight a duel in the circumstances to which you allude"" ""French Cats have recourse to their claws and not to their gold,"" said Brisquet.. ""Love without money is nonsense,"" I said. ""While you were seeking food you would not occupy yourself with me, my dear"" The very next day, indeed, the bench of Doctors' Commons was occupied by a procès-verbal in criminal conversation. Puff was deaf; his nephews took advantage of his weakness. Puck appeared, followed by several other Cats, and I was lost. I promised dear Brisquet to run away with him as soon as he could keep a wife comfortably, but Puck and his friends followed me. I am lost!"" I cried. ""I am lost,"" I cried, ""I'm lost!"" The next day Puff appeared, and Puck's nephews followed me, taking advantage of my weakness.. Puff said that at night I had flattered him by calling him, Mon petit homme! This was one of the most terrible things against me, because I could not explain where I had learned these words of love. The judge, without knowing it, was prejudiced against me. His lordship never suspected the low intrigues of which I was the victim. Many little Cats, who should have defended me against public opinion, swore that Puff was always asking for his angel, the joy of his eyes, his sweet Beauty! My own mother, come to London, refused to see me or to speak to me. She said that an English Cat should always be above suspicion, and that I had embittered her old age. I then saw perfectly clearly how everybody lost his head in England. When it is a matter of a criminal conversation, all sentiment is dead. ""I am an English Cat and I am innocent,"" he says. ""My Lords,"" he adds, ""I am not guilty of any crime."" He says he was framed for a crime he didn't commit. ""I have no idea why I was charged with it,"" he writes. ""It's a mystery to me"" he says, ""but I'm not guilty."" ""I'm an English cat and I'm innocent,"" the Cat says. 'My Lords, I am anEnglish Cat,"" he tells them. 'I am innocent. My Lords'. ""She questions the justice of old England which has created the jury!"" cried some one. ""Such piffle always drives an English audience wild,"" said Puck's attorney. ""I was condemned at the age of twenty-six months, when I could prove that I still was ignorant of the very meaning of the word, Tom"" ""What would be said of the justice  of old England if...."" said the writer. ""If...."" ""I could prove ... that I was not ignorant of ... the meaning of that word, and that I had never heard of it before"" ""If I could show that I knew what it meant to say, I would have said it to you in French."". Puck was furious to hear the loyalty of English Cats spoken of. Let us return to the wild life where we obey only our instincts, and where we do not find customs in conflict with the sacred wishes of Nature. At this moment I am writing a treatise on the abuse of the working classes of animals. Although we are celebrated for our scribbling I believe that Miss Martineau would not repudiate me. I believe she would not reject me, however. I am a man of letters, and I am not a dog. I have never been a dog, but I have been a cat. I was never a dog but I was a cat, and have been always a cat; I have always been a Cat. I will always be a Cat; I will never be a Dog. I cannot be a dog; I am always a Cat, and always will be a Cats.. Brisquet's body was slashed with a wound in the back. Coroner declared that he had poisoned himself with arsenic. But with Marsh's apparatus spots have been found on a plate. The coroner, by an infamous hypocrisy, declared that Brisquet had poisoned his body with arsenic, as if so gay, so light-headed a Cat could have reflected long enough on the subject of life to conceive so serious an idea. As if a Cat whom I loved could have the least desire to quit this existence!"
0.75,0.85,58.050702295306614,"Bianchon practised surgery for a long time before he took up medicine. His earliest studies were guided by one of the greatest of French surgeons, the illustrious Desplein. Like all men of genius, he had no heirs; he carried everything in him, and carried it away with him. The glory of a surgeon is like that of an actor: they live only so long as they are alive, and their talent leaves no trace when they are gone. Actors and surgeons, like great singers too, like the executants who by their performance increase the power of music tenfold, are all the heroes of a moment. It is a case in proof of this resemblance in the destinies of such transient genius. His name will survive in his special department without crossing its limits.. Desplein had a godlike eye; he saw into the sufferer and his malady by an intuition, natural or acquired, which enabled him to grasp the diagnostics peculiar to the individual. He determined the very time, the hour, the minute when an operation should be performed, making due allowance for atmospheric conditions and peculiarities of individual temperament. For must there not be some extraordinary circumstances to exalt the name of. C Cuvier was in all the secrets of the human frame; he knew it in the past and in the future, emphasizing the present. But did he epitomize all science in his own person as Hippocrates did and Galen and Aristotle? Did he guide a whole school towards new worlds? No. Everything in him was purely personal. Isolated during his life by his egoism, that egoism is now suicidal of his glory. He was a persistent observer of human chemistry. He knew the elements in fusion, the causes of life, life antecedent to life, and what it must be in its incubation or ever it IS. But he was not a scientist. He had no scientific genius, he was an egoist.. Desplein believed neither in the antecedent animal nor the surviving spirit of man. His bold and unqualified atheism was like that of many scientific men, the best men in the world. On his tomb there is no proclaiming statue to repeat to posterity the mysteries which genius seeks out at its own cost. But perhaps Desplein's genius was answerable for his beliefs, and for that reason mortal. To him the terrestrial atmosphere was a generative envelope. He saw the earth as an egg within its shell. He would not recognize either the cock or the egg. He was positive. He had no doubts; he was positive, and he was invincible atheists.. The life of this man, great as he was, was marred by many meannesses, to use the expression employed by his enemies, who were anxious to diminish his glory. This man died, it is said, in final impenetrable impotence, as do, unfortunately, many noble geniuses. He was a man of great genius, but he was also a fool. He had a sense of hearing and sight, but they were not absolutely necessary for hearing and seeing. He found that the solar plexus could supply their place without any possibility of doubt. He also found that he had a nervous centre, and a centre for aerating the blood.. In Desplein, his glory and science were invulnerable, his enemies attacked his odd moods and his temper, whereas, in fact, he was simply characterized by what the English call eccentricity. Sometimes very handsomely dressed, like Crebillon the tragical, he would suddenly affect extreme indifference as to what he wore; he was sometimes seen in a carriage, and sometimes on foot. By turns rough and kind, harsh and covetous on the surface, but capable of offering his whole fortune to his exiled masters--who did him the honor of accepting it for a few days--no man ever gave rise to such contradictory judgements.. The qualities of a great man are often federative. Genius always presupposes moral insight. He who can see a flower must be able to see the sun. The man who on hearing a diplomate he has saved ask, ""How is the Emperor?"" could say, ""The courtier is alive; the man will follow!""--that man is not merely a surgeon or a physician, he is prodigiously witty also. The qualities of great men are often Federative. The great man is often federated. The greatest man is always federative, the great man. The Great Man is often Federated, the Great Man. The Greatest Man is Often Federated.. Horace Bianchon was a medical student lodging in a squalid boarding house in the Quartier Latin, known as the Maison Vauquer. He felt there the gnawing of that burning poverty which is a sort of crucible from which great talents are to emerge as pure and incorruptible as diamonds. This poor young man had felt there. that which is the sort of. crucible which is to emerge from whichgreat talents emerge. from. The answer is to be found at the end of the narrative, and will avenge him for some foolish charges. It will be revealed that he might have been no less great as a minister than he was as. Horace was an upright young fellow, incapable of tergiversation on a matter of honor. He was neither a puritan nor a preacher; he could swear with a grace as he gave his advice. Most of his friends felt for him that deeply-seated respect which is inspired by unostentatious virtue, and many of them dreaded his censure. Horace, in short, was one of those friends who are never anxious as to what they may get in return for what they give, feeling sure that they will in their turn get more than they give. He had a great sense of humor, and was always ready for a jollification when occasion offered.. Bianchon was a jolly companion, not more prudish than a trooper, as frank and outspoken. He carried his poverty with the cheerfulness which is perhaps one of the chief elements of courage. As sober as a camel and active as a stag, he was steadfast in his ideas and his conduct. When a leading clinical practitioner takes a young man to his bosom, that young man has, as they say, his foot in the stirrup. The happy phase of Bianchon's life began on the day when the famous surgeon had proof of the qualities and the defects which, these no less than those, make Doctor Horace Bian chon doubly dear to his friends.. Bianchon was a friend of Desplein's. The two men were friends for years. Bianchon died of heart disease. Despleins died of lung cancer. He left behind a wife and two children. He is buried in Paris, in a small house, in the Pays de la Loire, near the Père Lachaise. He was buried next to his wife, who was also a friend. He also left a son, who is now a doctor, and a daughter, both of whom are also friends of the family. He died in 1852. He had a son named  ""Bianceton"" who was born in 1849. The son was named ""Cyril"". Bianchon was able to foresee the mortifications that awaited the only sentiment that lay hid in a heart that was steeled, but not of steel. He studied the eccentricities of that busy life, the schemes of that sordid avarice, the hopes of the politician who lurked behind the man of science. He saw, himself, to his being removed to a sick house, founded by the famous Dubois in the Faubourg Saint-Denis. When he had cured him he gave him the necessary sum to buy a horse and a water-barrel. This Auvergnat distinguished himself by an amusing action.. One of Desplein's friends fell ill, and he took him at once to his benefactor, saying to his donor, ""I could not have borne to let him go to any one else!"" The water-carrier was taken to the Hotel-Dieu, where he took the greatest care of him. The water carrier was a native of Cantal, and Despleins was a French Auvergnat. Desple in took a sort of pride in his cures at the hotel, and Bianchon saw nothing very strange in that. The pupil saw his master going into the church at about nine in the morning.. Rabelais was a follower of Cabanis. He was an atheist. He believed that the angels had no work to do with the lancet. Rabelais wrote that he was astonished to see Desplein kneeling humbly in the Lady Chapel, giving alms for the expenses of the service, alms to the poor. He said he was looking as serious as though he were superintending an operation. He also said that he had no mercy on the angels, because they had no fistula or gastritis.. Bianchon did not wish to seem as though he were spying the head surgeon of the Hotel-Dieu. Desplein asked him to dine with him that day, not at his own house, but at a restaurant. At dessert Bianchon skilfully contrived to talk of the mass, speaking of it as mummery and a farce. ""It has cost Christendom more blood than all Napoleon's battles and all Broussais' leeches,"" said Desple in reply.. ""Hallo! where is my worshiper of this morning?"" said Bianchon to himself. ""He said nothing; he began to doubt whether he had really seen his chief at Saint-Sulpice"" Desplein was delighted to disport himself in his most atheistical vein, or, to be accurate, a vile imitation of the Citateur. The wars of the Count of Toulouse against the Albigenses were the tail end of that dispute. The Vaudois and the Al bigenses refused to recognize this innovation. ""What floods of blood were shed to establish the Fete-Dieu, the Festival of Corpus Christi--the institution by. Bianchon did not attempt to follow the matter up, though it remained stamped on his memory. He remembered the day and hour when he had detected him going into Saint-Sulpice, and resolved to be there again next year on the same day and at the same hour, to see if he should find him there again. The questioner took this defeat for an answer; not so Bianchon. He resolved to watch Desplein. The young man to himself. He went to mass. He had been to see a priest who has a diseased knee-bone.. The mystery was greater than ever; the regularity of the phenomenon complicated it. In that case the periodicity of his devotion would justify a scientific investigation. In such a man there ought to be no direct antagonism of thought and action. The master-surgeon, the atheist at heart, the worshiper by chance. He founded it. He is the founder of it. The mystery was great than ever. He has come four times a year to attend this mass. He was the founder. The secret is that he is not a worshiper, but an atheist. He will not go to church. He cannot go to the church.. Some time elapsed before Doctor Bianchon, though so much his friend, found an opportunity of speaking to Desplein of this incident of his life. ""This is as great a mystery as the Immaculate Conception--an article which alone is enough to make a physician an unbeliever,"" he said. The doctor followed him, and knelt down by him without the slightest notice or demonstration of surprise from his friend. ""I am a physician, and I am a man,"" he replied, ""and I am not a man who believes in God."" ""I believe in God,"" he added, ""but not in the Catholic religion."". ""Will you tell me, my dear fellow,"" said Bianchon, as they left the church, ""the reason for your fit of monkishness?"" ""I am like a great many devout people,"" replied Moliere. ""I can be as much atheists as you or I can be."" ""All that has nothing to do with my question,"" retorted Bianch on the question. ""Why do you go to mass three times a week?"" ""Because I am a man of God"" ""Because you are a man, and I am not a man"". ""Faith! my dear boy,"" said Desplein, ""I am on the verge of the tomb"" ""I want to know the reason for what you have just been doing, and why you founded this mass,"" said Bianchon. ""I may safely tell you about the beginning of my life,"" said the great man. ""It was a greenish structure; the ground floor occupied by a furniture-dealer, while each floor seemed to shelter a different and independent form of misery,"" he said.. ""I lived up there for two years,"" Desplein exclaimed. ""We used to call it then the pickle-jar of great men!"" ""I worked through a whole winter, seeing my head steam, and perceiving the atmosphere of my own moisture,"" he said. ""I have blown on my frozen fingers in that PICKLE-JAR OF GREAT MEN, which I should like to see again, now, with you"" ""My early life was so hard, my dear Bianchon, that I may dispute the palm of Paris suffering with any man living,"" he added. ""What then?"" ""I went up there almost every day during my first youth,"" he replied, ""and I have endured everything"". ""I was alone, with no one to help me, no money to buy books or to pay the expenses of my medical training,"" he writes. ""My irascible, touchy, restless temper was against me. No one understood that this irritability was the distress and toil of a man who, at the bottom of the social scale, is struggling to reach the surface"" ""I do not know where a man finds the fulcrum that enables him to hold out against such a life,"" he says. ""I had, as I may say to you, before whom I need wear no draperies"" ""My morning meal cost me but two sous sous,"" he adds. ""That is the ground-bed of good feeling and keen sensitiveness which must always be the birthright"". ""I consumed more oil than bread; the light I burned during these endless nights cost me more than food. I found no sympathy anywhere"" ""I hardly know whether in later life we feel grief so deep when a colleague plays us false as we have known"" ""Zoppi's seemed to me a promised land where none but the Lucullus of the pays Latin had a right of entry"" 'I tried to master positive knowledge so as to acquire the greatest personal value' ""I found no sympathies anywhere."" ""I consumed less oil than I did bread"" ""My work was a long duel, obstinate, with no sort of consolation"" ""It was the most difficult work I have ever had to do"" ""The most difficult job I have never had to undertake"". ""No one in Paris can understand that nothing means NOTHING,"" he said. ""If you have a headache, you will be considered mad,"" he added. ""You yourself, my dear boy, are clever enough to make acquaintance before long with the odious and vicious warfare waged by mediocrity against the superior man,"" he wrote. ""And if you are a little hasty, no one can live with you,"" he concluded. ""No one can be a good friend if he has a headache."" ""I am not a man who can be called a man, but a person who is a man,"" said the poet. ""I have no idea what I am, but I am a man."". ""If, to make a stand against this armament of pigmies, you collect your best powers, your best friends will cry out that you want to have everything,"" he said. ""Your good points will become your faults, your faults will be vices, and your virtues crime,"" he added. ""If you save a man, you will be said to have killed him,"" he continued. ""Stumble, and you fall!"" he said, ""invent anything of any kind and claim your rights, you'll be crotchety, cunning, ill-disposed to rising younger men"" ""But we will not stir that mud-heap,"" he concluded.. I expected from my home a box full of linen, a present from one of those old aunts who, knowing nothing of Paris, think of your shirts, while they imagine that their nephew with thirty francs a month is eating ortolans. The box arrived while I was at the schools; it had cost forty francs for carriage. The porter, a German shoemaker living in a loft, had paid the money and kept the box. I walked up and down the Rue des Fosses-Saint-Germain-des-Pres and the Rue de l'Ecole de Medecine. ""I spent the most miserable night of my life,"" he writes. ""I repeated these unanswerable questions again and again, in tears, as madmen repeat their tunes"" ""My good fellow, refined souls, have none of that spirit of intrigue that is fertile in resource and device,"" he adds. ""Their good genius is chance; they do not invent, things come to them"" ""I am a man of the world,"" he says, ""and I am not afraid to say so."" ""I have been a man for a long time, and I am proud of it,"" he concludes. ""But I am no longer afraid to admit that I have been afraid of it."". ""I am a poor man, a foundling from the hospital at Saint-Flour, without either father or mother, and not rich enough to marry"" ""I fell asleep; poverty has for its friends heavenly slumbers full of beautiful dreams."" ""I am in a great fix,"" said I. ""I have a hand-cart downstairs which I have hired for two sous an hour; it will hold all our goods"" ""If you like, we will try to find lodgings together, since we are both turned out"". ""Bourgeat paid up my arrears and his own, and settled with the porter. Then he put our furniture and my box of linen in his cart, and pulled it along the street, stopping in front of every house where there was a notice board"" ""We dined together, my humble friend and I. Each of us was to pay sixty francs a year. So there we were housed, his humble friend, and we dinedtogether"" ""I was very happy to be in Paris, and to be with my friend."" ""I have a trunk downstairs with a hundred francs' worth of linen. Out of which I could pay the landlord and all I owe to the porters, and I have not a hundred sous."". Bourgeat, who earned about fifty sous a day, had saved a hundred crowns or so. He would soon be able to gratify his ambition by buying a barrel and a horse. On learning of my situation, he gave up for a time the ambition of his whole life. For twenty-two years he had been carrying water in the street, and he now devoted his hundred Crowns to my future prospects. Desplein at these words clutched Bianchon's arm tightly. ""He gave me the money for my examination fees! That man, my friend, understood that I had a mission, that the needs of my intellect were greater than his"". Bourgeat, a man of about forty, had a homely, mediaeval type of face, a prominent forehead, a head that a painter might have chosen as a model for that of Lycurgus. The poor man's heart was big with affections seeking an object; he had never been loved but by a poodle that had died some time since. His dog, said he, had been a good Christian, who for twelve years had accompanied him to church, never barking, listening to the organ without opening his mouth, and crouching beside him in a way that made it seem as though he were praying too. ""This man centered all his affections in me;. ""Bourgeat did all my errands, woke me at night at any fixed hour, trimmed my lamp, cleaned our landing,"" writes the author. ""He was as good as a servant as he was as a father, and as clean as an English girl"" ""He gave to all he did the grace of simplicity while preserving his dignity,"" writes author. 'He seemed to understand that the end ennobles every act' says author of ""Bourgeats' ""Love of a girl of the people transferred to a loftier level,"" says writer. ""It was, in fact, the devoted affection of the lower classes, the love of aGirl of the People"" ""I felt an indescribable, dull pain, knowing that he could no longer live with me,"" says author."

The one had to defend the other in battling against the enemies who threatened him. In the absence of his companion the other was expected to say to one who should have accused his good brother of any disloyalty, wickedness or dark felony, ""You have lied by your throat,"" and so go into the field instantly, so sure was the one of the honour of the other. There is no need to add, that the one was always the second of the others in all affairs, good or evil, and that they shared all good or bad fortune.. Two young men became brothers on the day they were born. They were the sons of two brothers who were killed in battle in the Battle of the Somme. The brothers were the son and son-in-law of the son of a man who was killed in the battle. The son and daughter were the brother and sister of the father and son who died in battle. They are the sons and son of two young men who died on the same day. The father and the son were killed by the son in battle on the Somne. The mother and son were the daughter and son died in the same battle, and the father died in childbirth.. The Cadet of Maille was not of a pleasing physiognomy. He had scarcely any beauty but that of the devil. For the rest he was lithe as a greyhound, broad shouldered and strongly built. On the other hand, the Sieur de Lavalliere was a dainty fellow. His long dark locks were pretty as a lady's ringlets. He was a child with whom all the women would be glad to play. As they had each received slashes in the doublets, they baptised their fraternity with their blood.. The Cadet of Maille was forced to quit the Court after the death of King Francis. His mother obtained for him a graceful maiden of good appearance, and well furnished with everything. He took this gallantry as a reproach, because, being only 16, he took it as an insult. The Dauphine, niece of the Pope, said laughingly to the Queen of Navarre, ""that this page was a plaster to cure every ache"" The Cadet was soon married to Mademoiselle d'Annebaut, who was well furnished and had many lands to inherit. He was also given a splendid hotel in the Rue Barbette.. ""He was very loath to leave his good wife, so young, so delicate, so sprightly, in the midst of the dangers, temptations, snares and pitfalls of this gallant assemblage,"" says the author. ""In this state of intense jealousy everything made him ill at ease; but by dint of much thinking, it occurred to him to make sure of his wife in the manner about to be related"" He invited his good brother-in-arms to come at daybreak on the. Lavalliere asked Maille to accompany him. Maille said he had a love suit on with his lady, who had given him an assignation. Lavalliere said: ""If she deceives me--well a friend is worth more than a mistress!"" The two men went to a country house, where they lived together for a few months. The Maille died in a car accident, and his wife died of a heart attack. The couple had been married for a year.. Lavalliere asked Maille to take charge of his wife. Maille replied that he would be happy to do so. Lavalliere said that he feared evil-minded people would take advantage of the situation. The two friends then went their separate ways, and Maille returned to France. The story of the Cuckold and the Caterer was published in 18th-century France. It was first published in Paris in 1805. The book was published by Paternoster Books, with a serialization by the same name, and was first serialized in 1807. The novel was written by Charles de Girolamo, who was also a member of the Paternosto.. ""There is it in them a thing which is more woman than they are, and but for the respect which is due to them, I would use another word. Now we should never awaken the phantasy of this malevolent thing. Then it would be those soft words and things which the ladies understand so well, little attentions paid to a guest"" ""Are you accustomed to take anything in the morning in bed, such as honey, milk, or spice? Do the meal times suit you? I will conform mine to yours: tell me. You are afraid to ask me. Come--"" ""I am intruding, send me away,"" she would say.. Lavalliere suspecting the lady's games, told her that Maille loved her dearly, that she had in him a man of honour, a gentleman who doted on her, and was ticklish on the score of his crown. ""Why then, if he is so ticklish in this manner, has he placed you here?"" she asked him. ""Was it not a most prudent thing?"" replied he. ""I will go. You want to be left alone--I will leave you alone"" ""You want to go?"" ""Yes. I will go."". ""I am proud of it!"" exclaimed Lavalliere. ""Was it not necessary to confide you to some defender of your virtue?"" ""Ah!"" said she, ""he has made a very bad choice"" ""Then you are my guardian?"" said she. ""Then I am your guardian"" ""I am not your guardian,"" replied she. 'I am the guardian of you' ""Then, I am yours,"" she said. ""And you are mine."". ""What is the matter with you?"" he asked her. ""I am very unhappy,"" she replied. ""My life is full of tears,"" she said. ""And I have experienced nothing but the reverse of pleasure"" ""I want to be a woman,"" she added, ""but I am not a woman."" ""I would like to be one,"" he said. She said, ""I do not want to become a woman"" ""And so I am a woman, and I want to live,"" she continued. ""But I am also a woman. I am unhappy."". The author of ""The Art of Love"" was a lover of the art of love. She was inspired to write a book about her love for her husband, who was also her lover. The book is called ""The Secret of Love,"" and is published by Simon & Schuster, publishers Simon &Schuster, Inc. (Simon and Schuster Ltd) London, London, England. The author is also the author of the novel ""The Love of the City,"" published by Penguin Books, London. The novel is about a city in the midst of a war between two rival factions of the city's inhabitants. The city's residents are fighting for control of its resources, and the war is being fought for their lives. Lavalliere was forbidden to touch Marie d'Annebaut. She became more in love with him because he was fruit three times forbidden. She said to him, ""I would willingly take your disease. Together we should then have the same terrors"" Lavalliere left her to go to his beautiful Limeuil. He was never seen again by Marie d’Annebauts. She died in childbirth in 1837. She was buried in a secret grave in the town of Mont-Blanc, near Paris.. Lavalliere was madly in love with the fair Limeuil. The ladies were jealous of the handsome Lavalliere. Marie d'Annebaut was fortified at every point against the gallants of the Court. There are no bounds so impassable as those of love, and no better guardian. It is like the devil, he whom it has in its clutches it surrounds with flames. The knights carried on their amours bravely two by two.. Queen Catherine, who from political motives fermented these loves and stirred them up, like pastrycooks make the oven fires burn by poking, glanced at all the pretty couples interwoven in the quadrille, and said to her husband: ""When they combat here, can they conspire against you, eh?"" ""Ah! but the Protestants?"" ""Bah! have them here as well,"" said she, laughing. ""Why, look at Lavalliere, who is suspected to be a Huguenot; he is converted by my dear little Limeuil, who does. Lavalliere found himself abandoned by everyone like a leper. The king made an offensive remark, and the good knight quitted the ball-room. Marie in despair at the speech. She had in every way ruined the man she loved: she had destroyed his honour, and marred his life. No woman would bind herself in legitimate marriage with the finest gentlemen in the kingdom if he were only suspected of being one of those whom Master Frances Rabelais named ""his very precious scabby ones. . . .   The physicians and master surgeons advance as a fact, incapable of contradiction, that persons Italianised by this love sickness, lost through it their. Lavalliere's companion said to him on the road home from Hercules House, where the fete had been held: ""My dear lord, I have done you a great mischief"" ""Ah, madame!"" replied Lavalliere, ""my hurt is curable; but into what a predicament have you fallen?"" ""Ah!"" said she, ""I am sure now always to have you to myself; in exchange for this great obloquy and dishonour, I will be forever your friend, your hostess, and your lady-love--more than that, your servant. My determination is to. ""Alas!"" said she, ""this sly and superficial caress will be for the future the only pleasure of our love. It will still be a hundred times better than the joys which poor Maille fancies he is bestowing on me"" Lavalliere, terrified, placed his hand upon her heart, below a breast of matchless beauty. The lady revived at the warmth of this beloved hand, experiencing such exquisite del. Lavalliere and Marie d'Annebaut slept far from the other, heavily weighed down with love. Lavalliere found himself under the ban of love and marriage. He found how much it costs to guard the virtue of a woman. The more honour and virtue he displayed the more pleasure did he experience in these great sacrifices offered at the shrine of brotherhood. Nevertheless, his duty was very bitter, very ticklish, and intolerable to perform, towards the last days of his guard. He was killed by a sword in the courtyard of the hotel. He is buried in a grave in the town of Chateau de Lusse.. The confession of her love, which she believed was returned, emboldened the fair Marie, who fell into a platonic love, gently tempered with those little indulgences in which there is no danger. From this cause sprang the diabolical pleasures of the game invented by the ladies, who since the death of Francis the First feared the contagion, but wished to gratify their lovers. To these cruel delights, in order to properly play his part, Lavalliere could not refuse his sanction. Thus every evening the mournful Marie would attach her guest to her petticoats, holding his hand,. ""No, dearest, for thy voice transfigures me,"" she said. ""Your regard burns me,"" he replied. ""Oh! put thine hand upon my heart,"" she replied. Their eyes wept warm tears, they seized each other hard and fast as fire seizes houses. ""I love but you,"" she told him. ""My heart is your throne"" ""I see but thee,"" he said. 'I love only you' ""I am your queen,"" she answered. 'And I am your king' ""My love, my queen,"" he answered.. Lavalliere had promised to return safe and sound to his friend the body only, not the heart. The two brothers slept together, according to the ancient custom, in the village of Bondy. They recounted to each other, one of the adventures of his journey, the other the gossip of the camp, stories of gallantry, and the rest. Lavalliere was killed in a battle with the French army in 1793. Lavalliere and Maille were re-united on the morrow. Marie d'Annebaut made a great fuss with her good husband. Lavalliere refused Maille's request to accompany him to the war. Maille insisted on keeping his friend company as far as Meaux. The couple were married in 1815. Lav alliere died in 1822. MailLe died in 1830. LavAlliere died on 18 September 1822, aged 75. The novel was published in 1823. The first edition was published by Le Monde, Paris, in 1821.. Lavalliere left Metz for Paris. His wife, Marie, suspected the grief of poor Lavalliere. She died when he fell before Metz, as has been elsewhere related by Messire Bourdeilles de Brantome in his tittle-tattle. But as she still kept her love in the recesses of her heart, she died when Lavallier fell beforeMetz. The story of the fall of Metz is told in the novel ""The Death of Lavall"

Lambert died in 1805. He was buried in Paris in 1810. He is survived by his wife, two children and two grandchildren. The book is called ""Lambert: A Biography of a Man"". Mme. de Dey was the widow of a Lieutenant-General, a Knight of the Orders of Saint Michael and of the Holy Ghost. She had left the Court when the Emigration began, and taken refuge in the neighborhood of Carentan, where she had large estates. Her calculations, based on a thorough knowledge of the district, proved correct. The Revolution made little disturbance in Lower Normandy.. She was about thirty-eight years of age, and still preserved, not the fresh, high-colored beauty of the Basse-Normandes, but a fragile loveliness of what may be called an aristocratic type. She was possessed of the indescribable charm that wins good will without loss of dignity or effort.. Her figure was lissome and slender, her features delicate and clearly cut; the pale face seemed to light up and live when she spoke. But there was a quiet and devout look in the great dark eyes, for all their graciousness of expression. In this lay the secret of her greatest charm, a youthfulness of the inmost soul, betrayed at times by her face, and a certain tinge of innocent wistfulness in her ideas. She had been compelled to set constant restraint upon her frank impulses and. Mme. de Dey's affections were concentrated in one sentiment—a mother's love for her son. All the happiness and joy that she had not known as a wife, she had found later in her boundless love for him. She was miserable when they were apart, and nervous about him while he was away. She could never see enough of him, and lived through and for him alone.. The late Comte de Dey was the last of his race, and she, his wife, was the sole heiress and descendant of her house. Medical science had predicted his death a score of times, but she had held fast to her presentiments and her hopes, and had known the inexpressible joy of watching him pass safely through the perils of infancy.Thanks to her constant care, the boy had grown up and developed so favorably, that at twenty years of age. Mme. de Dey was a rich, noble, and the mother of an Emigrant. With the one desire to look after her son's great fortune, she had denied herself the happiness of being with him. When she read the rigorous laws in virtue of which the Republic was daily confiscating the property of Emigrants at Carentan, she congratulated herself on the courageous course she had taken.. The procureur of the commune might be seen at her house, the mayor, the president of the ""district,"" and the public prosecutor, and even the judges of the Revolutionary tribunals went there. She succeeded in winning the affection of the poor, ministering without distinction to everyone in trouble. She made herself necessary to the well-to-do, by providing amusements for them. She had foreseen the difficulties that would beset her at Carentan.. The four first-named gentlemen were none of them married, and each paid court to her, in the hope that Mme. de Dey would take him for her husband. The public prosecutor, once an attorney at Caen, and the Countess's man of business, did what he could to inspire love by a system of devotion and generosity, a dangerous game of cunning!. The Countess of Dey kept her room, and would see no one, not even her own servants. She hoped, by gaining time, to emerge safe and sound from her difficulties at last. At that time Royalists in the provinces flattered themselves with a hope, daily renewed, that the morrow would see the end of the Revolution—a conviction that proved fatal to many of them. The almost claustral lives of dwellers in small towns fosters a habit of. Gossip: The doctor has been playing chess in my house all day. He said to me, laughing, that in these days there is only one disease, and that, unluckily, it is incurable. Brigitte had been seen in the market-place betimes that morning, and, wonderful to relate, she had bought the one hare to be had. The whole town knew that Mme. de Dey did not care for game.. The hare became a starting point for endless conjectures. Everyone had a version. The public prosecutor spun out a whole drama to bring Mme. de Dey's son to her house of a night. There all the rich widows' suitors were fain to invent more or less probable fictions. Each one thinking the while how to turn to his own advantage the secret that compelled her to compromise herself.. The Countess was accused of generosity that the law of those days defined as a crime. The president of the district had strong leanings toward a Chouan chief, or a Vendean leader hotly pursued. Others voted for a noble escaped from Paris.. The Countess's real friends were so much alarmed for her, that on the morning of the third day the Procureur Syndic of the commune made his wife write a few lines to persuade Mme. de Dey to hold her reception as usual. The old merchant took a bolder step. Strong in the thought of the service he meant. The Countess of Dey was found in her garden, gathering the last autumn flowers in her borders to fill the vases. The merchant told her of the gossip that was circulating in the town, and showed her the danger that she was running. He wound up at last with saying that ""if there are some of our public functionaries who are sufficiently ready to pardon a piece of heroism on your part so long as it is a priest that you wish. The Countess of de Dey looked at her visitor with a wild excitement in her manner that made him tremble, old though he was. For the first time since she had come to the little town her soul found sympathy in another soul. ""I trust in you,"" she said softly. ""Why did I come but to share in your crime?"" the old merchant said simply. ""Because I love you,"" the Countess replied.. The merchant in this crisis recovered his old business shrewdness, and the advice that he gave Mme. de Dey was full of prudence and wisdom. Feeling no doubts as to his means of escape, he wrote that within three days he was sure to reach her, disguised. He implored his mother to send a considerable sum of money by the bearer, who had gone through dangers innumerable to deliver it.. The Countess of Carentan was suffering from gout. Her friend Tronchin told her to put the skin from a live hare on her chest, and keep perfectly still. The Countess, he said, had lain in danger of her life for the past two days. She was now sufficiently recovered to receive visitors that evening. This tale had an immense success in Carentans. It put almost everyone who took an interest in the mysterious affair upon the wrong scent.. The Countess of Carentan had given up the enjoyment of luxuries to which she had formerly been accustomed, for fear of offending the narrow prejudices of her guests. The local doctor, a Royalist in petto, added to its effect by gravely discussing the specific. Suspicion, nevertheless, had taken too deep root in a few perverse or philosophical. Mme. de De De Vere was a woman of the French Revolution. She was a member of the Royal House of Lords, and was a prominent member of its council. She had been a member for more than 30 years. She died in 1852, and is buried in a cemetery in the town of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France.. Mme. de Dey had drawn her visitors into little groups, had made parties of whist, boston, or reversis, and sat talking with some of the young people. She seemed to be living completely in the present moment, and played her part like a consummate actress. The public prosecutor and one of the judges of the Revolutionary Tribunal kept silence, however.. Brigitte was looking round her son's room, and was looking around it. She elicited a suggestion of loto, and saying that no one else knew where to find the game, she left the room. ""Here I can breathe and live. A few minutes more, and he will be here, for he is alive,"" she said. ""I would give the rest of my life to know whether he is still in prison or tramping. Brigitte was delighted to see her son coming home. The Countess was also delighted to have her son back. Brigitte told the story of how she tried to turn a key in the Bible. The key did not turn. The soldier was returned to France. The story was told in a book called ""The Last Soldier's Story"" (1962). ""Poor Monsieur Auguste!"" cried Brigitte; ""I expect he is tramping along the lanes!"" ""And that is eight o'clock striking now!"" cried the Countess in terror. ""He is still alive; I would stake my salvation on it; God cannot be mistaken"" ""If only I could see him here in the house, in spite of the danger."". The French Revolution was a time of great upheaval in France. The French army was in full-blown revolt against the French monarchy. The revolution was fought over the right of the people to vote for the French throne. The war was won by the French people, and the revolution was a victory for the people. The battle for the throne was fought in the streets of Paris, not in the mountains. The Battle of the Bulge was fought on the road from Paris to Carentan, and ended in a. The wayfarer came into Carentan, the gleaming moonlit outlines of its towers stood out for a moment with ghostly effect against the sky. The magistrate was not far to seek, and in a few minutes the conscript was sitting on a stone bench in the mayor's porch waiting for his billet. The foot soldier was a good-looking young man, who appeared to be of gentle birth.. The conscript's name was Julien Jussieu. He was a Norman. The mayor of Carentan gave him a billet on Mme. de Dey. The conscript said he was three leagues ahead of the battalion. The Norman replied: ""Your comrades must be a good way behind?"". ""He knows quite well that he has not far to go, and when he gets outside he will very soon cross the marketplace,"" said the mayor to himself, as the other went out. ""He is uncommonly bold! God guide him!... He has an answer ready for everything,"" he said. ""It looks as if the prosecutor meant to stop,"" said a lady, who noticed that that important personage was not in the group.. Mme. de Dey shuddered. There was something appalling in their long silence. ""At this moment, for lack of a word, one of us—you or I—may carry our heads to the scaffold. The Countess made an involuntary sign of denial, but her face had grown white and drawn with the struggle to maintain the composure that she did not feel. ""Very well,"" the Revolutionary official went on, ""receive him; but do not let him stay under your roof after seven o'clock to-morrow morning"" ""I will make it clear that the denunciation was false by making a thorough search,"" he went on in. A knock at the door rang through the house. The prosecutor raised her politely. ""To your own free will alone would I owe you,"" he said. ""Oh!..."" cried the terrified mother, falling upon her knees; ""save him! save him!"" ""Yes, let us save him,"" returned the public prosecutor, and his eyes grew bright as he. The Countess's need to believe in the faith of her sometime attorney was so great, that she dared not entertain any suspicion of him. She fled upstairs; she felt scarcely strength enough to stand; she opened the door, and sprang, half dead with fear, into her son's arms. "". ""Ah! monsieur,"" she said, leaning on the arm of Brigitte's husband, feeling for the first time the full extent of a sorrow that had all but killed her at its first threatening; ""ah! m Monsieur, I cannot stay to see you any longer ... permit my servants. ""Hold your tongue, chatterbox,"" said her husband, in a low voice; ""do you want to kill madame?"" ""I shall not stay here,"" cried Mme. de Dey. ""I Shall go into the conservatory; I shall hear better there if anyone"

He soon became listless and weary, seeing that he loved the open air and his little comforts. He fell into moods of such strange melancholy that his letters having been read in full. The queen was told to beg a papal brief of special indulgences to cure the king of his melancholy. But she refused, alleging that it would be dangerous for her soul. Adrian VI., the Dutchman, still wore the tiara, and was concerned in the affair. The queen was the first to say that she wished she had wings. To this Monseigneur Odet de Chatillon replied, that she had no need of them to be an angel. Then, nothing else was spoken about but this deplorable abstinence, and the lack. ""God has done very well to fix it,"" said the Dauphine, quietly. ""For our husbands would leave us rather badly off during their absence"" ""If it had been permissible to prepare pleasure like mustard, the queen would have been laden"". The Castilian king asked the Emperor Charles for a favour out of his ransom. He said it would be an everlasting disgrace to one king to let another. A captain who had been thinking of seeking his fortune at the Court of France, fancied that by procuring his majesty a soft cataplasm of warm flesh, he would open for himself an honestly fertile door. The captain begged him not to be offended at the licence of his language, and confessed to him, that he the king was said to be one of the. The king of France was speaking of his many adventures. He said that no woman of any country, including those of the moon, knew better than the ladies of France the secrets of this alchemy. He felt himself the man, were she then within his reach, to clasp her to his heart, even on a rotten plank a hundred. The king was offered a Spanish night of love by a captain of the Spanish army. The captain asked the Marchesa of Amaesguy to smother the King of France with kindness. She became passionate as a lion that has broken out of his cage, and made the bones of the king crack.. The king said that the ladies of his court were of a passable temperature. The captain was strongly piqued at his language. He fancied that his majesty wished to bilk him like a student, stealing a slice of love at a brothel in Paris.. The king was too courteous and gallant a knight to refuse this request, and even made a pretty and right royal speech, intimating his desire to lose the wager. Nevertheless, not knowing for the matter of that, if the Mar. The king of Navarre, weary of Spanish customs, wished to disport himself after the fashion of France. The king's wife was the origin of Larray de la Ville-aux-Dames.. The captivity of its king is a most calamitous and horrible evil to fall on the populace. If it had been a queen, or even a princess, what worse fate? But I believe the thing could not happen again, except with cannibals.. ""It was necessary that the worst of devils, id est, a wicked old here"
0.79,0.89,64.28571428571429,"The Lord of Montcontour was a brave soldier of Tours. He had two sons, good Catholics, of whom the eldest was in favour at court. The eldest was killed in a duel by the lord of Villequier. His father had arranged a capital marriage for the said son with a young lady of the male branch of Amboise. By this death most piteously inopportune, vanished all the future and advantages of his family, of which he wished to make a great and noble house. He died on St Bartholomew's Day, and was buried at Montcontours. The castle of Vouvray was built in honour of the battle gained by the Duke of Anjou, afterwards our right glorious king, and is named after him.. His father wanted to make his son a cardinal of renown. With this idea, he had put his other son in a monastery, under the guidance and government of a man renowned for his holiness. The good abbot kept the young man in a private house, and had to sleep by his side in his cell, allowed no evil weeds to grow in his mind, brought him up in purity of soul and true condition, as all priests should be. This said clerk, when turned nineteen years, knew no other love than the love of God, no other nature than that of the angels who had not our carnal properties. The which the King on high, who wished to have His pages always proper, was afraid of. He has done well, because His good little people cannot drink in dram shops or riot in brothels as ours. The lord of Montcontour determined to withdraw his second son from the cloister, and invest him with the purple of the soldier and courtier. He determined to give him in marriage to the maiden, affianced to the dead man, which was wisely determined because wrapped round with continence and sobriety in all ways as was the little monk. The befrocked, unfrocked and very sheepish in his ways, followed the sacred wishes of his father, and consented to the said marriage without knowing what a wife, and--what is more curious--what a girl was. By chance, his journey having been hindered by the troubles and marches of conflicting parties, this innocent--more innocent than it is lawful for a man to be innocent--only came to the castle of Mont Contour the evening before the wedding.. In the most noble house Amboise there still lived the Dowager of Chaumont, an old woman of well proved virtue, in whom had retired all the religion and good conduct of this fine family. But now here, now there, lived miserably in company with honest women. The poor old lady Virtue had retired trembling, no one knew whither, but now here,. now there,. lived miserly in company of honest women, and the devil had many a good orgy in all things, since that misconduct was fashionable. And so it was with the Amboises, and with all the rest of the French people, until the end of time.. Madame Amboise was invited to her daughter's wedding, and also the lord of Braguelongne. But the dear dowager came not to Montcontour, because she could not obtain relief from her sciatica, her cold, nor the state of her legs, which gamboled no longer. It hurt her much to let go into the dangers of the court and of life this gentle maiden, as pretty as it was possible for a pretty girl to be, but she was obliged to give her her wings. But it was not without promising her many masses and orisons every evening for her happiness. The said lady had taken to her bosom, from the age of ten years, the little maiden who is concerned in this adventure, and who had. The maid arrived with a great noise, conducted by servants, chamberlains, grooms, gentlemen, and people of the house of Chaumont. At length, embracing her with tears, the virtuous dowager made those last recommendations to her that ladies make to young brides. Then, the feasting over, they were married with great pomp on the Lord's Day, a mass being said at the castle by the Bishop of Blois, who was a great friend of the lord of Montcontour. The feasting, the dancing, and the festivities of all sorts lasted till the morning. The feast was held at the home of the abbot of Mont Contour, and was attended by many of the lords of the castle.. The story is said to have taken place in Montcontour, in Touraine. The bride's bridesmaids kept quarrelling with the husband to prevent him going to his wife. However, the good lord of Mont Contour interrupted the jokers and the wits. Then went the innocent into the chamber of his wife, whom he thought more beautiful than the Virgin Mary painted in Italian, Flemish, and other pictures.. The Chevalier de Montcontour felt very much embarrassed at having so soon become a husband. He saw the gentle girl who was given him, comfortably tucked up in the bedclothes, terribly curious, her head buried under, but hazarding a glance as at the point of a halberd, and saying to herself -- ""I must obey him"" He saw her awaiting the will of this slightly ecclesiastical gentleman, to whom, in fact, she belonged. He scratched his ear, and knelt down, a thing in which he was expert. He asked her if she had said her prayers.. The young couple commenced the business of a housekeeping by imploring God, which was not at all out of place. But unfortunately the devil heard, and at once replied to their requests, God being much occupied at that time with the new and abominable reformed religion. ""What did they tell you to do?"" said the husband. ""To love you,"" said she, in perfect innocence. ""I love you, I am ashamed to say, better than I love God."" ""Well,"" said he, ""don't look at me again"". ""I'm going to take my clothes off, and come,"" the young damsel says. ""I know not what, between his chattering jaws,"" the man replies. ""Ah! with what affection he studies it, with what study he examines it, in what examination he holds it, then throws it, rolls and tosses it about with passion,"" he adds. ""And often, when it is an ape of low extraction and intelligence, leaves the nut behind"" ""I am going to bed with you,"" she says, ""and come."" ""And so they found themselves, so to speak, united, but far from what you can imagine what,"" he says.. A man and his wife were unable to discover the secret of marriage. The man was obliged to ask his wife for help and aid. They wisely agreed to say that they had done so. When the wife got up, still a maiden, seeing that she had not been crowned, she boasted of her night, and said she had the king of husbands. The pair dropped off to sleep, wretched at having been unable to find the secret. But they wisely agreed that they'd done so, and went on with their chattering and repartee as briskly as those who know nothing of these things. They were asleep when the wife woke up, and boasted that she'd had her night.. A lady of Roche-Corbon incited a young maiden, de la Bourdaisiere, to ask the bride how many loaves her husband put in the oven. ""Twenty-four,"" she replied. The ladies believed that the joy of that night had cost him dear, and that the said bride was already regretting having so quickly ruined him. And at breakfast came the bad jokes, which at that time were relished as excellent, one said that the bride had an open expression; another, that the oven had been burned. And a thousand other jokes, stupidities, and double meanings that, unfortunately the husband did not understand. The two families have lost something that night that they would never find again.. At this was quite contented my said Sieur de Braguelongne, upon whom my lady of Amboise, excited by the thought of the good things which were happening to her daughter, cast the glances of a falcon in matters of gallant assignation. But on account of the great affluence of the relations, neighbours, and others, no one had been to bed; all had danced, rollicked, and frolicked, as is the custom at noble weddings. The poor Lieutenant civil, learned in bailiffs' men and sergeants, and who nabbed all the pickpockets and scamps of Paris, pretended not to see his good fortune, although his good lady required him to do. Monsieur de Braguelongne thought of confiding his case to the said lady d'Amboise. But he made first awkwardly and shyly certain twists and turns, finding no terms in which to unfold his case. He thought of asking her about the religious precepts of his abbot, who had told him to inquire concerning all things of old people expert in the ways of life. He made no attempt to hide his feelings, but instead of asking the question he asked the mother of his wife. He was asked to leave the room where he was with the bride, but out came instead of the lieutenant the husband, to walk about in company with the mother. The lieutenant received a half-verbal summons to which it was not becoming, as in legal matters, to. ""This Ho, Ho, with a beard of flies' legs, a flimsy, old, grey, ruined, shaggy beard--beard without comprehension, beard without shame, without any feminine respect,"" he said. ""This vile joker with a squashed nose, fiery nose, frozen nose, nose without religion, nose dry as a lute table, pale nose,. nose without a soul, nose which is nothing but a shadow,"" he continued. ""Nose that I hate, old nose, Nose full of mud--dead nose,"" he added. ""May the Italian sickness deliver me from this vile jokers with aSquashed nose,"" the poet concluded.. ""I give my share to the devil of this juiceless beard, of this grey beard,"" she writes. ""I'll take a young husband who'll marry me properly, and . . .  I'll take an old rag of a man, and I'll marry him properly"". ""Ah! young beard, sweet scented! Ah! pretty new nose--fresh beard-- innocent nose--virgin appeared"" ""Young beard of springtime, small key of love!"" ""Pretty new nose -- fresh beard -- innocent nose -- virgin appeared""""Young beard -- young beard -- virgin nose -- young new nose"" ""Pretty young nose --fresh beard -- Innocent nose -- innocent beard"" ""Fresh beard -- pretty new beard-- virgin nose-- young new beard"". During this time the good old Braguelongne had been growling and saying to himself, ""Old ha, ha! old ho, ho! May the plague take thee! may a cancer eat thee!"" And the husband was well content, and thanked Madame d'Amboise, begging her to say nothing of this arrangement. The husband was said to have said to himself: ""Old wretch whose look kills! Old moustache of an old theriacler! Old wretch to make dead men weep. ""I'll give all my future to be quit of thee!"" said the young bride to her young husband. She thought to save him much tribulation, shame, and labour by instructing herself. And she counted upon much astonishing and rejoicing him the next night when she should say to him, teaching him his duty. ""That's the thing my love!"" she said to him. ""It's the most important thing in marriage."" ""I've never been able to understand it. I've never seen it."". The lord of Braguelongne, ashamed of being lost in sad contemplation of this evening's work, and of saying nothing to his gay companion, put this summary interrogation to the fair bride. ""If she was not happy with so good a young husband--"" he asked. ""He is very good,"" said she. ""Too good, perhaps,"" said the lieutenant smiling. From this a hundred knives were drawn between them, but they kept the sheaths. Meanwhile the spouses in bed were arranging to themselves how to get away, in order to please each other. The said lady d'Amboise pretended after supper to play terrible music in a high key to Monsieur Bragulongne saying that he had no gratitude for the blessings she. ""Both at different times left their conjugal couch and came to their preceptors, both very impatient, as you can well believe,"" says the author. ""Ah, my dear,"" said the bride, ""you already know more than my master."" ""From these curious tests came their domestic joy and perfect fidelity,"" he adds. ""They found out how much better each of them was adapted for love than anyone else, their masters included"" ""Never did scholars receive more gayly the precepts of any language, grammar, or lessons whatsoever,"" he says. ""And the two spouses returned to their nest, delighted at being able to communicate to each other the discoveries of their scientific peregrinations"" ""They were delighted at having each other as their masters,"" he writes, ""and their master was their master."". ""Do like me, be cuckolds in the blade, and not in the sheath,"" said the lord of Montcontour. ""Which is the true morality of the conjugal condition,"""
0.72,0.82,60.772257747171665,"Avenelles was the most evil-minded advocate that has ever lived, laughing at the gallows, and a true Judas. He wore a nasty red beard, as shiny as a stick of liquorice, and was devilishly pale, as are all the rogues who take refuge in the darkness of the law. He was in this affair, half knave, half fool, as it is abundantly proved by this narrative. He had a very lovely lady of Paris, of whom he could not account for a pleat in the sheets, which would have been wrong, because honest creases are often met with. He could not have known that she was a woman, and that she had been killed.. The Sieur Avenelles was a murderous and evil man. His wife was faithful enough to him, always ready, like a candlestick, arranged for her duty. But she folded her clothes very well, so there's the end of the matter. The advocate had placed her under the guardianship and pursuing eye of an old servant, a duenna as ugly as a pot without a handle, who had brought up the Sie. Madame was smitten with a young Italian, lover of the queen-mother, and a handsome Italian. The young gentleman grew to admire Madame, whose silent love spoke secretly to him, without either the devil or themselves knowing how. Both one and the other had their correspondence of love, and the young man grew to love the woman who spoke to him secretly. The pair were married for a year, and had a son, a son-in-law, a daughter, a grandson, a granddaughter, a great-granddaughter, a niece, a sister, a nephew, a brother, a cousin, a friend, and an aunt.. The advocate's wife adorned herself only to come to church, and always came in some new sumptuosity. Instead of thinking of God, she made God angry by thinking of her handsome gentleman, and leaving her prayers, she gave herself up to the fire which consumed her heart. ""Ha! I would give my life for a single embrace with this pretty lover who loves me,"" she said. ""To feel the glorious youth of this gentle lover, to have the full joys of love, to taste all in one moment, little should I mind the flames into which the heretics are thrown,"" she added. The gentleman gazing at the charms of this good wife, and her burning blushes when he. The two lovers squeezed, pressed, breathed, ate, devoured, and kissed each other by a look which would have set light to the match of a musketeer. The gentleman dressed as a scholar of Montaign, began to regale the clerks of the said Avenelles. Then he said aside to himself: ""By the double horn on my father, I swear to have the woman, though it cost me my life."" The advocate, obliged to follow the course of this conspiracy, and, in case of failure, intending to revenge himself upon the Guises, determined to go to Blois, where the court then was in great danger of being carried off.. The Italian, intoxicated with love, called together all his pages and vassals, and posted them in such a manner that on the arrival of the advocate, his wife, and her duenna, it was stated to them that the hostelry being full, in consequence of the sojourn of the court, they must go elsewhere. Then the gentleman made such an arrangement with the landlord of the Soleil Royal, that he had the whole of the house, and occupied, without any of the usual servants of the place remaining there. For greater security, my lord sent the said master and his people into the country, and put his own in their places, so that. ""Avenelles"" is a play about a trap set up by a man to trap his wife and duenna. The play is set up in the Soleil Royal, where the king and his wife were staying. The king's steward, pages, and female servants are dressed as guests and innkeepers. The queen and her advocate are dressed like guests and servants of the inn. The whole farce is a farce, but the king is not the only one who sees it. ""The fool's wife, husband, and Duenna"" is played by the king's wife and the duenna, and the whole thing is a trap, says the playwright. ""No one had a right to be astonished or to talk of the roguish trap, or. The advocate, being lodged, the lover walked about the courtyard, watching and waiting for a glance from the lady. He did not have to wait very long, since the fair Avenelles, looking soon into the court, after the custom of the ladies, recognised her gallant and well-beloved gentleman. At that she was very happy; and if by a lucky chance both had been alone together for an ounce of time, that good gentleman would not have had to wait for his good fortune, so burning was she from head to foot. ""Ha! you want lords, my dear, do you?"" said the advocate,. The advocate was so terribly spiteful that the lady rose, and said to him -- ""Well, kill me. Never touch me again, after having thus menaced me"" ""We have gone a little too far. Kiss me, chick-a-biddy, and forgive me,"" said the advocate. ""I will neither kiss nor pardon you,"" said she ""You are a wretch!"" ""Remember that if I have a pencase at my side instead of a sword, I has a penknife in this pencase, and that penknife will go into your heart on the least suspicion of. The trap was lifted by two cords of black silk, to which were attached loops, through which she passed her arms. The trap closed as it has opened, leaving the old woman in a state of great flabbergastation, and she perceived that the women had been robbed. The woman was the wife of a man who had been killed in a battle. The man was the son of a woman who had died in childbirth, and had been left to die in childbirth. He was the husband of an old woman who was killed by a trap that had been lifted by a man. The lady was the widow of a man who died of childbirth, but was left alive.. Madame Avenelles found a dainty supper, a good fire in the grate, but a better in the heart of her lover, who seized her. She remained dumbfounded, watching for the Sieur Avenellis. She allowed herself to be properly pressed, adored, caressed, delighting to be admirably adored. The one was cuckoldom, and the other the private property of Madame Advocate. The jealous man had taken the keys with him. He would attack everything, for in his rage he would attackEverything. The old woman knew well the crucible, the great work. She knew the alchemists at their furnaces reading Herr Trippa. As much as the al. The young lady and the gentleman ate little supper, but retired early to rest. Both agreed to be all in all to each other the whole night long, no matter what the result might be. In short, both of them caring little for life, because at one stroke they consummated a thousand lives, enjoyed with each other a thousand delights. They gave to the other the double of their own, believing, he and she, that they were falling into an abyss, and wishing to roll there closely clasped. They knew not love, the poor citizens, who live mechanically with their good wives, since they know not the fierce beating of the heart, the hot gush of life, and the vigorous clasp as of two young lovers, closely united.. The husband, so well cuckolded that all memory of marriage had been swept away by love,--the said Avenelles found himself in a great fix. To the council of the Huguenots came the Prince of Conde, accompanied by all the chiefs and bigwigs, and there it was resolved to carry off the queen-mother, the Guises, the young king, and to change the government. This becoming serious, the advocate seeing his head at stake, did not feel the ornaments being planted there, and ran to divulge the conspiracy to the cardinal of Lorraine, who took the rogue to the duke, his brother, and all three held a consultation, making fine promises.. The advocate planted a blow in the stomach of the servant, and by a gesture commanded her to be silent. Then he felt in his valise, and took therefrom a good poniard. While he was opening and shutting it, a frank, naive, joyous, amorous, amory, pretty, celestial roar of laughter, followed by certain words of easy comprehension, came down through the trap. The husband took the duenna by the arm, and went softly at the stairs searching for the door of the chamber in which were the lovers. The lover tried to snatch the poniard from the hands of the knave, who held it firmly. Then the devil, newly horned, maliciously ordered, in his patois, the servants to tie the lovers with the silken cords of the trap. And the thing thus done in a moment, he rammed some linen into their mouths to stop their cries, and ran to his good poniards without saying a word. He then threw away the trap, and helped the duenna to make them fast. The devil then threw the trap away, and threw the paniard away, he helped theDuenna to made them fast, and then ran to the pniard without saying. The Sieur Avenelles was arrested by officers of the Duke of Guise. He was taken to the castle prison with his wife and the duenna. The prince was later released and returned to the Guises. The queen was anxious to consult him and asked him to come with her to the council. He refused and was taken away by the Guise officers. He later died in prison in France in 1793. The story was told in a play by the French playwright Jean-Baptiste Lamarque. The play was set in Paris in the 17th century. The film was directed by Jean-Michel Basquiat.. The Sieur Avenelles was thrown into a damp dungeon, without air, and his pretty wife placed in a room above him, out of consideration for her lover. The lover was the Sieur Scipion Sardini, a noble of Lucca, exceedingly rich, and, as has been before stated, a friend of Queen Catherine de Medici. The lady was placed in the jail of the castle, in a pleasant place level with gardens, and the advocate in a safe dungeon, not without chaining him hand and foot. The which the said office promised, and arranged matters according to the wish of the gentleman, who accompanied the lady as far as the courtyard of the castles.. Monseigneur Sardini, who was deeply smitten with Limeuil, asked why the good Judas had been caged. He was given the idea of lodging the king in the castle of Amboise, in order to catch the heretics there like foxes in a bag, and there to slay them all. Sardini made the privy counsellors all agree, telling them to turn it to their own advantage. The queen-mother and Guises dissimulated, and how the Riot of Am Boise terminated. This is not the subject of the present narrative. The story of how the king was killed by the Guises is told in the novel, The Riot of the Amboises.. The Luccanese told the Cardinal of Lorraine that he should put the rogue in a sack and throw the old black gown into the Loire. The cardinal told him his intention was not in any way to harm the rogue, but that fearing his repentance, and for greater security of his silence until the end of the affair, he would liberate him at the proper time. ""Ha, ha!"" said the cardinal; ""you give good council. Now I will, before distilling your advice, have them both more securely guarded"" The cardinal then ordered an officer of police, who was ordered to let no person whoever he might be, communicate with the two prisoners. The officer of Police said: ""Hi, there!"". The men charged with the arrest of the advocate had received a verbal order to treat him as a man of importance. Monseigneur Sardini, fearing for his mistress the danger of the proximity of this red learned rogue, determined to carry her off in the night, and put her in a place of safety. Then the cardinal begged Sardini to say at his hotel that the said advocate had departed from Blois to return to his causes in Paris. The advocate had kept thirty gold crowns in his purse, and resolved to lose them all to assure his vengeance, and. The French king ordered his lover to kill his wife and throw her into the river. He then hired boatmen to take her to the wall of the gardens where he would await her. The lover sent a letter to his lover in a plate of cucumbers to advise her of her approaching widowhood, and the hour of flight, with all of which was the fair citizen well content. The letter was sent in reply to a letter sent by the Duke of Guise to the queen-mother, who was in her apartments above the stronghold. The queen said ""Amen"" to the letter, which was sent to her lover. The king then ordered the boatmen and boatmen, and three of his most active servants to. The queen sent soldiers out of the way by the queen, who sent them to look at a ray of the moon, which frightened her. The servants raised the grating, and caught the lady, who came quickly enough, and was led through the house to Monseigneur Sardini. But the postern closed, and the Italian outside with the lady. behold the lady throw aside her mantle, see the lady change into an advocate, and see my said advocate seize his cuckolder by the collar, and half strangle him, dragging him towards the water to throw him to the bottom of the Loire. Then he was quiet, falling into a slough under the feet of the advocate, whom he recognised.. Monsieur Sardini was killed by his wife's lover. He was buried in a shallow grave. The wife was never found. The husband was never prosecuted. The widow was never buried. She was buried with her husband's body in a secret grave. She never saw her husband again. He died in 18th century France. He is buried with his wife in a grave in the village of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris. He never saw his wife again. She died of natural causes. She had no children. She is buried in the same grave as her husband. She will never be buried.. The actress, who"

He was so well known for his discretion, his benevolence, and other ecclesiastical qualities, that he had customers at Court. The Lady Desquerdes gave him a bone of St. Victor, by virtue of which all the miracles were performed.. The good priest had the best of reputations, that of a man valiant under arms. So he lived like a king. He made money with holy water; sprinkled it and transmitted the holy water into good wine. But one day the courageous canon found himself weak in the back, seeing that he was all sixty- eight years old. He said in joke, ""I should like to put on a mitre for a handkerchief in order to have my head warmer"". The Canon of St. Pierre-aux-Boeufs confessed ladies of high lineage, and did it very well. Then thinking over all his good works, he thought it about time to cease his apostolic labours, the more so as he possessed about one hundred thousand crowns earned by the sweat of his body. So that it was said at Court that in spite of the efforts of the best young clerks. The canon was a priest who lived a life of evil. He died in a secluded place in the mountains of France. He had been dead for more than fifty years. The devil had taken possession of his body. The canon's former customers said the devil could only by his great heat have furnished these hermetic. Well-disposed people and those not wanting in sense, or the citizens who argued about everything, demanded why the devil rested under the form of a canon. Some said that doubtless the devil wished to convert himself, and others that he remained in the shape of the canon to mock at the three nephews and heirs of this said brave confessor. But as this devil had been undoubtedly cooked and ruined by them, and that for a queen of twenty years he would not have moved, they cooked him and ruined him. An old woman related that for certain the canon was the devil, because his two nephews, the procureur and the captain, conducting their uncle at night, without a lamp, or lantern, had caused him by accident to tumble over a heap of stones gathered together to raise the statue of St. Christopher. At first the old man had struck fire in falling, but was, amid the cries of his dear nephews and by the light of the torches they came to seek at her house found standing. The old canon, devil or not, kept his house, and refused to die. He had three heirs with whom he lived as with his sciaticas, lumbagos, and other appendage of human life. Of the said three heirs, one was the wickedest soldier ever born of a woman, and he must have considerably hurt her in breaking his egg.. Captain Cochegrue was captain of a company of lancers, and much esteemed by the Duke of Burgoyne. He endeavoured always to give blows without receiving them, which is, and always will be, the only problem to solve in war. His creditors, the blockheads, citizens, and others, whose pockets he slit, called him the Mau-cinge, since he was as mischievous as strong.. Pille-grue had a lean body, seemed to throw off very cold water, was pale of face, and possessed a physiognomy like a polecat. He was worth many a penny more than the captain, and had for his uncle a little affection. But since about two years his. The author's cousin was kicked out of his will by his sister's husband. The author's brother and his brother-in-law found their share of the estate very small. The will was given to a poor cousin, son of another sister of the canon, who was a shepherd.. ""Chiquon"" was a shepherd who lived with his old uncle. He made himself the canon's dog, his servant, the staff of his old age. The uncle repulsed poor Chiquon, making him turn about like a die. ""Such a numskull was he,"" said the uncle, ""that this Chiqu on was helping to kill him"". Chiquon, the son of a shepherd, was determined to do well by his uncle. The canon began discoursing concerning the the devil and the grave agonies, penances, tortures, etc., which God will get warm for the accursed. Thereupon, hearing this, Chiquon determined to make his uncle appear better. But as he had a behind shaped like a pair of pumpkins, was. ""I should very much like to see the devil. Ha, ha! I am not afraid of his claws!"" ""Confess again, Mr. Canon. I assure you that will be a precious merit on high."" ""There, there! Do you mean it?"" ""Yes, Chiquon."". ""Thou dost not tremble, Chiquon, to deny the devil?"" he asked. ""I trouble no more about it than a sheaf of corn,"" he replied. ""God will defend me from the devil because I believe him more learned and less stupid"". ""But,"" said the captain, with his big voice, ""everything then will be Chiquon's"" ""No,"" replied the canon, smiling, ""because I shall have made my will in proper form, the inheritance will be to the sharpest of you three"". ""What do you think of Chiquon?"" said Pille-grue to Mau-cinge. ""I think, I think,"" said the soldier, growling, ""that I think of hiding myself in the Rue d'Hierusalem, to put his head below his feet; he can pick it up again if he likes"". ""Do you hear, Mister Canon?"" he asked. ""Yes,"" said he, ""I hear the wood crack. The good lady was to hear him, a right merry wench, quick at opportunities, giving an embrace while her husband was mounting the stairs, devouring the commodity as if she was swallowing a a strawberry. She had the reputation of a prudent woman, the confidence of her husband, the keys of the house, the purse, and all all her possessions. She was gay as an honest. The writer's wife is a doctor at her husband's house. She lets him go to bed alone, and comes to doctor her malady in the room where the chest is. The husband spends as much as on the horses in his stable, she says. She says she is an income from cuckoldom.. ""He loves me well, as all good cuckolds should love the man who aids them, to plant, cultivate, water and dig the natural garden of Venus, and he does nothing without me"" -- Chiquon. ""He was illuminated by the light issuing from his danger, and counselled by the intelligence of those measures. ""If one of your neighbours had planted a horn on your forehead and he was delivered to you, bound hand and foot, would you throw him into the river?"" asked Chiquon. ""Rather,"" said the jeweller, ""but if you are mocking me I'll give you a good drubbing"". ""Make a pretence that I have bought the said chest of you, and I will be upon the bridge with a cart, waiting your orders."" Now make a pretense that I've bought theSaid jeweller took his cloak and his hat, and parted company with his crony without saying a word. He ran. ""Are you in your sound senses? Where do you see a chest? Is the usual to put friends in chests? Am I a woman to keep chests full of friends?"" ""Oh!,"" said the jeweller, ""my good woman, there is a bad young man, who has come to warn me that you allow yourself to be embraced by our advocate, and that. ""You give me great pleasure,"" said she; ""I don't attach any value to my chest, and by chance there is nothing in it. It will be easy to have the mischievous chest taken away tomorrow morning. Will you sup?"" ""Not at all,"" said he, ""I shall sup with a better appetite without the chest"". ""Go on,"" said the wife, ""go on, it's the lid shaking"" The chest slid gently down the stairs. ""Ho there, carrier!"" said the jeweller, and Chiquon came whistling his mules, and the good apprentices lifted the litigious chest into the cart. ""Master, the chest is speaking,"" said an apprentice. ""In what language. The shepherd, accompanied by the good jeweller, carried all the baggage to the water-side without listening to the high eloquence of the speaking wood. After tying several stones to it, the jeweller threw it into the Seine. Then Chiqoun continued along the quay, as far as the Rue- du-port, St Laudry, near the cloisters of Notre Dame. There he. ""Keep under arms, for he is quite capable of easing you of the rest,"" said the shepherd. The good shepherd took to his heels and ran to the Rue des Marmouzets. Captain Cochegrue was feasting with La Pasquerette, the prettiest of town-girls. Her appearance was so tickling to the sight, that it would have put all Paradise. The shepherd entered the Rue des Marmouzets. He saw several lights at the windows and night-capped heads thrust out. Good wenches, gay girls, housewives, husbands, and young ladies, all of them are just out of bed, looking at each other as if a robber were being led to execution by torchlight. ""We thought it was the Armagnacs descending upon the town, but it's only Mau-cing. Pasquerette's companion said, ""How could I murder so good of girl, and one I loved so much? But, yes, I have killed her, the thing is clear, for in her life never did her sweet breast hang down like that"" The girl who had by chance a bad toothache, and was taking the air at her garret window, spied the old crookshanks, without wishing to do so.. ""No, you are a right loyal cousin, an honest man, and if you have ever to put an enemy out off the way, I am there, ready to kill even one of my own friends for you,"" said Mau-cinge to La Pasquerette. ""Put the tables straight, wipe up your blood, it belongs to me, and I'll pay you for it"". ""This is my cousin whom I wish to entertain, even when it were necessary to turn the house out of windows. We shall get back everything tomorrow in the cellars. Come, fall to!"" ""It is only in these. The said captain Cochegrue was gay as a hundred schoolboys at the breaking up of class. He made his good cousin drink deeply, who spilled everything country fashion, and pretended to be drunk. They went along, disputing about a thousand theological subjects which got very much mixed up. They finished by rolling quietly up against the garden where were the crowns of the Lombard.. Cochegrue, making a ladder of Chiquon's broad shoulders, jumped on to the pear-tree like a man expert in attacks upon towns. Versoris, who was watching him, made a blow at his neck, and repeated it so vigorously that with three blows fell. Chiquon was a shepherd in Paris. His uncle, the canon, had gone to the cathedral for breakfast. Chiquon thought it was out of reverence. He asked if the canon was ill. The servant replied that he had gone out of respect. The shepherd ran into the room where the canon generally sat, and to his great astonishment behel was there."

Clad in satin, glittering with gold and laden with gems, they all told of passions, intense, but of various styles, like their beauty. One seemed to say: ""My beauty has power to rekindle the frozen heart of age."" Another: ""I love to repose on soft cushions and think with rapture of my adorers."" A third, a novice at these fêtes, was inclined to blush. The women differed neither in their words nor their ideas; but an expression, a look,. The woman sitting next to Belvidéro looked at him with flashing eyes. ""At the bottom of my heart I feel compunction,"" she seemed to say. ""I am a Catholic and I fear hell; but I love you so—ah, so dearly—that I would sacrifice eternity to you!"" The fourth, emptying a cup of Chian wine, cried: ""Hurrah, for pleasure! I begin a new existence with each dawn"" The sixth of the prince, with an expression of murderous glee on her lips and a look of Bacchanalian frenzy in her eyes, asked the seventh: ""When is your father going to die?"". The seven women of Ferrara, the friends of Don Juan, and the prince himself gave an exclamation of horror. Two hundred years later, under Louis XV, well-bred persons would have laughed at this sally. But perhaps at the beginning of an orgy the mind had still an unusual degree of lucidity. Despite the heat of the candles, the intensity of the emotions, the gold and silver vases, the fumes of wine, despite the vision of ravishing women, perhaps there still lurked in the depths of the heart a little of that respect for things human and divine which struggles until the revel has drowned it in floods of sparkling wine. The night was black.. The father of Don Juan was an old man of ninety, who had devoted the greater part of his life to business. Death, aided by the cold, the silence, the gloom, perhaps by a reaction of intoxication, was able to force some reflections into the soul of the spendthrift. ""I value a tooth more than a ruby,"" he used to say, smiling, ""and power more than knowledge."" Never did an oldMan find such pleasure in watching a young man. Never did a man find such delight in watching Don Juan. Never. did an man findSuch pleasure in Watching a youngMan.. Paternal love robbed age of its terrors in the delight of contemplating so brilliant a life. Bartholomeo lodged himself in the most uncomfortable wing of his palace and rarely went out. Don Juan could not intrude into his father's apartment without first obtaining permission. If this voluntary recluse came or went in the palace or in the streets of Ferrara he seemed to be searching for something which he could not find. He walked dreamily, undecidedly, preoccupied like a man battling with an idea or with a memory. While the young man gave magnificent entertainments and the palace re-echoed his mirth, the horses pawed the ground in the courtyard and the pages quarreled at their game of. ""Never before was so untroublesome and indulgent a father to be found on this earth"" ""Young Belvidéro, accustomed to treat him without ceremony, had all the faults of a spoiled child"" ""He felt a newborn remorse while he traversed the corridor, and he very nearly forgave his father for having lived so long"" ""Don Juan recognized that it would be difficult to find an instance in which his father's goodness had failed him"" ""I am not a man of the world, but of the people,"" he said, ""and I am not of this world, either. I am the son of a man, and I am a man to be reckoned with."". Don Juan's father was sick in a bed in an antique room. A sudden flare of light, caused by a gust of wind, illumined his father's face. The features were distorted; the skin, clinging tightly to the bones, had a greenish tint. drawn with pain, the mouth, gaping and toothless, gave breath to sighs which the howling of the tempest took Tip and drew out into a dismal wail. The scene formed so striking a contrast to the one which Don Juan had just left that he could not help shuddering. The cold air whistled through the insecure windows, and the snow beat with a dull sound against the panes. Don Juan felt cold when, on approaching the bed, a sudden flare-of-light,. The eyes, hallowed by disease, retained a singular steadiness. A superior spirit was fighting there with death. Don Juan felt a certain shame at having come to the deathbed of his father with a courtesan's bouquet on his breast. The pure, high voice of a singer who entertained the guests, strengthened by the chords of the viol by which she was accompanied, rose above the roar of the storm and penetrated the chamber of death. ""You were enjoying yourself!"" cried the old man, on seeing his son. ""I was enjoying myself!"" said Don Juan, ""and I was enjoying it very much."" ""I am a man of the people,"" said the dying man. ""And I am the man of this country."". Don Juan would gladly have shut out this barbarous confirmation of his father's words. ""I do not grudge you your pleasure, my child,"" said Tholomeo. ""Oh!"" cried Don Juan, ""if it were possible to preserve your life by giving you a part of mine!"" ""It is as if I offered the world to my mistress,"" thought the spendthrift. ""There, you shall be satisfied,"" said the dying man, ""there, you Shall be satisfied"". Don Juan's father said: ""I have no more desire to die than you have to give up your lady loves, wine, horses, falcons, hounds and money"" ""I can well believe it,"" thought his son, kneeling beside the pillow and kissing one of Bartholomeo's cadaverous hands. ""Yes, my dearest father, you will indeed live as long as I do, for your image will be always in my heart"". ""God! I am also God!"" growled the old man. ""Be careful what you say, for you have received extreme unction,"" said Don Juan. ""But, father,"" he said aloud, ""my dear father, we must submit to the will of God!"" Through the dull wail of the snowstorm came again the melody of the viol and the heavenly voice, faint as the dawning day. ""I thank you for having brought singers and music! A banquet, young and beautiful women, with dark locks, all the pleasures of life. Let them remain. I am about to be born again. ""Rub me with this water and I shall come to life again,"" said the old man. ""There is very little of it,"" replied the young man. The old man turned his head toward Don Juan with a violent wrench. His neck remained twisted like that of a marble statue doomed by the sculptor's whim to look forever sideways. He was dead, dead in the act of losing his only, his last illusion. In seeking a shelter in his son's heart he had found a tomb more hollow than those which men dig for their dead. ""I have spent twenty years in —"". Don Juan's father's face turned pale as he looked at the flask. His hair rose with horror and his tense gaze seemed still to speak. The silence was profound, the viol was mute. A sharp creak, like that of a rusty spring, broke the silence. Don Juan, in his surprise, almost dropped the flask, and he thought he saw his father move. But he closed his eyes, just as he would have pushed down a window-blind on an autumn night. He stood motionless, lost in a world of thought. He had not seen his father's eye pale. He thought he had seen him move, but it was just a muscle twitching.. Don Juan heard a cock of a clock and heard the noise of a merry troop trying to collect itself in some sort of order. The door opened and the prince, the seven women, the friends of Don Juan and the singers, appeared, in the fantastic disorder of dancers overtaken by the morning, when the sun disputes the paling light of the candles. Don Juan replaced it in the drawer of the little Gothic table. The old timepiece was more faithful in its master's service than Don Juan had been in his duty to Bartholomeo. This instrument was composed of wood, pulleys, cords and wheels, while he had that mechanism peculiar to man, called a heart. The prince. The men stopped, motionless. The women, whose lips had been parched with wine, threw themselves on their knees and began to pray. Don Juan could not help shuddering as he saw this splendor, this joy, laughter, song, beauty, life personified, doing homage thus to Death. But in this adorable Italy religion and revelry were on such good terms that religion was a sort of debauch anddebauch religion. The prince pressed Don Juan's hand affectionately, then all the figures having given expression to the same look. Don Juan was a boaster of impiety, but he loved his father, after all. He returned in the evening to the death chamber, his soul puffed up with a horrible egoism. He found all the servants of the household busied in collecting the ornaments for the bed of state on which ""feu monseigneur"" would lie to-morrow. It was a curious spectacle which all Ferrara would come to admire. The prince said to la Rivabarella: ""Heigho! who would have thought Don Juan a mere boaster?"". The body of Bartholomeo lay on a long table. Don Juan made a sign and the servants stopped at once, speechless and trembling. The face already had large purple spots, which showed the urgency of completing the embalming. Despite the skepticism with which Don Juan was armed, he trembled as he uncorked the magic phial of crystal. When he stood close to the head he shook so that he was obliged to pause for a moment. When the old servant, who was the last to leave, had died away on the stone flooring, Don Juan locked the door hastily, and exclaimed: ""Now, let us try!"". Don Juan had allowed himself to be corrupted by the customs of a dissolute court. An idea worthy of the Duke of Urbino came to him, and gave him a courage which was spurred on by lively curiosity. He took a piece of linen and, after having moistened it sparingly with the precious liquid, he passed it gently over the right eyelid of the corpse. The eye opened! It seemed as if the glowing eye would pierce Don Juan. He saw an eye full of life, a child's eye in a death's head, the liquid eye of youth, in which the light trembled.. ""He might have lived a hundred years longer!"" he cried involuntarily when, led in front of his father by some diabolical influence, he contemplated the luminous spark. The room was sown with points full of fire, of life, of intelligence. Everywhere gleamed eyes which shrieked at him. He walked up and down the room, not daring to look at the eye, which stared back at him from the ceiling and from the hangings. The intelligent eye closed, and then opened again abruptly, as if assenting to his death.. Don Juan tried to close the white eyelid, but his efforts were in vain. He crushed out the eye, pressing it in with the linen without looking at it. A deep moan, startling and terrible, was heard. The eye winked at Don Juan, saying, ""Yes,"" by means of an ironical wink. Don Juan said, ""Ah!"" cried Don Juan: ""there is sorcery in it!"" The eye said, 'Yes,' and Don Juan replied, 'Ah!'. Don Juan was considered a dutiful son. He raised a monument of white marble over his father's tomb. His deep, searching gaze penetrated the principles of social life. He understood the world all the better because he viewed it across a tomb. He analyzed men and things that he might have done at once with the past, represented by history, with the present, expressed by the law, and with the future revealed by religion. He was not altogether at ease until the statue of his father, kneeling before Religion, imposed its enormous weight on the grave. He had buried the only regret that had ever touched his heart, and that only in moments of physical depression.. Don Juan was a man who despises the world, but seizing the world. He grasped existence as a monkey seizes a nut, peeling off the coarse shell to enjoy the savory kernel. Like Death, wherever he passed, he devoured all without scruple, demanding a passionate, Oriental love and easily won pleasure. He never made the mistake of those strong men who, imagining that little Souls believe in the great, venture to exchange noble thoughts of the future for the small coin of our ideas of life. He might, like them, have walked with his feet on earth and his head among the clouds, but he preferred to sit at his ease and sear the lips of more than one tender, fresh and sweet woman.. Don Juan was serious, unreserved, sincere as a German student. But he said ""I"" while his lady love, in her folly, said ""we"" He knew admirably how to yield himself to a woman's influence. He was always clever enough to make her believe that he trembled like a college youth who asks his first partner at a ball: ""Do you. Don Juan was a man who believed that courage was rashness, prudence, cowardice, generosity, shrewd calculation, justice, a crime, delicacy, pusillanimity; honesty, policy. He believed that the persons who were really honest, delicate, just, generous, prudent and courageous received no consideration at the hands of their fellows. He was a model of grace, but he allowed himself to be carried only where he wished to go. There was banter in his simplicity and laughter in his tears, for he could weep as well as any woman who says to her husband: ""Give me a carriage or I shall pine to death"". ""He was the embodiment of Molière's Don Juan, Goethe's Faust, Byron's Manfred, and Maturin's Melmoth,"" says the play's author. ""He understood the mechanism of human society, and never offended too much against the current prejudices,"" he adds. ""It does not come from a god!"" he adds, ""but he bent the social laws to his will with the grace and wit"". Don Juan's life was a mockery, which embraced men, things, institutions, ideas, ideas. He played with everything. His genius incorporated in advance all these. He was a deep genius of Don Juan. He had a great talent for mocking both men and things. He could be content to work in silence, like Bonaparte, or to goad on the universe by sarcasm, like the divine. ""If it were absolutely necessary to choose, I should rather believe in God than in the devil,"" he said. ""After your elevation to the papacy, one may expect anything,"" he added. ""I have a whole existence in reserve to repent the faults of my first life,"" he told Don Juan. ""Oh, if that is your idea of old age,"" cried the Pope, ""you are in danger of being canonized"" ""St. Peter is the genius who gave us our double power,"" said the Pope to Don Juan, ""and he deserves this monument. Don Juan and the Pope laughed. They understood each other. A fool would have gone next day to amuse himself with Julius II at Raphael's house or in the delightful Villa Madama. But Belvidéro went to see him officiate in his pontifical capacity, in order to convince himself of his suspicions. Under the influence of wine della Rovere would have been capable of forgetting himself and criticising the Apocalypse. But sometimes at night I fancy that a deluge will pass a sponge over all this, and it will need to be begun over again. But he was intentionally neither a good father nor a good husband. He had observed that we are never so. Don Juan's plan was a serious jest, a game of chess which he had reserved for his old age. Don Juan saw that this young girl was a woman to make a long fight with a passion before yielding to it, so he hoped to keep from her any love but his until after his death. The greater part of his wealth lay buried in the cellars of his palace at Ferrara, whither he seldom went. The rest of his fortune was invested in a life annuity, so that his wife and children might be interested in keeping him alive. The Abbot of San Lucas was selected by Don Juan to direct the consciences of the Duchess of Belvidéro and of Philippe. The Abbot was a holy man, of fine carriage, well proportioned, with beautiful black eyes and a head like Tiberius. Don Juan was obliged to pass his last days like a country parson, without scandal. Sometimes he took pleasure in finding his wife and son remiss in their religious duties, and insisted imperiously that they should fulfil all the obligations imposed upon the faithful by the court of Rome. The old nobleman still hoped perhaps to be able to kill a monk before finishing his first lease of life.. The Duke of Belvidéro died in 17th century. He was the son of the Duke of Aragon and the daughter of the Count of Artois. He died of gout, a troublesome sciatica and an obstinate cough. His last days were filled with pain and uncertainty. He wrote: ""The last jest in the farce was to make others believe in the laws and principles at which he scoffed"" The Duke's last will and testament was published in 1776. He is buried in the Cimetier du Cap-Francois in Paris.. ""My friends, my dear wife, you will forgive me, will you not? I torment you sometimes,"" he said. ""I, who should be their joy, am their bane,"" he added. ""It was a paternal system which succeeded infinitely better than that which his father had formerly employed toward him,"" he continued. ""My bold hands trembled, his graceful limbs tottered, and then one night apoplexy turned its hooked and icy fingers around his throat,"" he wrote. ""How canst Thou make use of me thus to prove these two angelic creatures! I, whoShould be theirJoy, am Their bane!"". Don Juan was a brilliant and skeptical man, whose intellect only was left unimpaired by the general decay. He lived between a doctor and a confessor, his two antipathies. Was there not a bright light burning for him behind the veil of the future? Over this veil, leaden and impenetrable to others, transparent to him, the delicate and bewitching delights of youth played."
0.3,0.4,23.76984126984127,"Philippe de Mala, as he was called, resolved to behave well and to serve his protector. He saw in this mysterious Council many men leading a dissolute life and yet not making less, nay, gaining more, than all the other virtuous and well-behaved ones.. The priest of Touraine promised to feast himself, to eat his bellyful of roast meats and other German delicacies, when he could do so without paying for them as he was poor. He was savage that he did not know how to make up to these gallant sirens, who snubbed. The Touranian, all simpleton and innocent as he was, treasured up under his mattress the money given him by the good archbishop for writings and copying. He hoped one day to have enough just to see a cardinal's lady-love, and trusting to God for the rest.. Huss was hairless from top to toe and resembled a man about as much as a goat with a night-dress on resembles a young lady. He wandered in the evenings through the streets of Constance, careless of his life, and peeped at the cardinals entering the houses of their sweethearts. Then he saw the wax-candles light. Philippe was a young man when he first met the Elector of Bavaria. He wanted to play the cardinal to some lovely dame. He was given many a thump and hard blow, but the devil sustained him. He believed that sooner or later it would come to his turn. Philippe de Mala was taken to the lady of the house by her handmaidens. The lady was without petticoat or head-dress. Philippe, struck motionless, stood quite at his ease, letting wander over her his eyes that glowed and sparkled with the flame of love.. ""He has fine eyes, Madame,"" said one of her handmaids. ""Where does he comes from?"" asked another. ""Poor child!"" cried Madame, ""his mother must be looking for him. Show him his way home."". Philippe was dismissed with a gesture which the Pope Jehan himself would have obeyed, especially as he was like a snail without a shell. The very humble priest trembled in his skin to have confessed so much to his superior.. ""Well, Philippe, if thou will renounce her, I will present thee with thirty angels from the poor-box,"" said the prelate. ""Ah! my lord, I should be losing too much. Philippe de Mala spent his angels--acquired with so much labour--in perfumes, baths, fomentations, and other fooleries. He played the fop. ""Whence comes this precious fellow that has not heard of La Belle Imperia?"" asks the stranger. ""She had brave captains, archers, and nobles, ready to serve her at every turn,"" he says. ""A free fight only brought a smile to her lips,"" says the Sire de Baudricourt.. Madame Imperia ruled everyone with a high hand in virtue of her pretty babble and enchanting ways, which enthralled the most virtuous and the most unimpressionable. The good Emperor Sigismund replied to a lady who complained of it to him,. The night came; the little Touranian, exalted with pride caparisoned with desire, glided like an eel into the domicile of the veritable Queen of the Council. Then was he sad, and without taking bite or sup,. The dazzling Imperia was seated near a table covered with a shaggy cloth ornamented with gold. Flagons of wine, bottles of the hippocras, flasks full of good wine of Cyprus, pretty boxes full of spices.. The story of a rogue priest who changed his name to a king. The story was told by a young woman who saw him as a young man. She said he had changed from a young priest to an old devil. He replied that he had become richer than a king because of her.. The Bishop of Coire wishes to speak with you, says Madame. She is ill of this little priest who is torturing my brain, says she. The Bishop is indignant and angry. He says: ""Stop, my friend."". The young priest was hungering only for Imperia, near whom he was already seated. The sound of an approaching cavalcade was heard in the street. The number of horses, the ""Ho, ho!"" of the pages, showed plainly that some great prince hot with love, was about. The cardinal, who was a cunning Italian, long bearded, and the life and soul of the Council, guessed, by the feeblest exercise of the faculties of his understanding, the alpha and omega of the adventure. He arrived with the appetite of a hungry monk, and to obtain its satisfaction he was just the. ""Ventredieu! You are a nice little fellow, and I should not like to have to let your master know the weight. ""Choose the gallows or a mitre,"" said the cardinal to the Bishop of Coire. ""A good fat abbey"" was the answer. ""I will choose the mitre"" replied the cardinal. ""And I will die in it"". ""Oh, oh!"" cried the cardinal, ""thou meritest more than an abbey. Ah, Ventredieu! my young friend, here are 100 golden crowns for thy journey to the Abbey of Turpenay, which I won yesterday at cards, and I make you a free gift."". The Touranian, heeding not the brewing storm avoided it by walking out silently with his ears down, like a wet dog being kicked out of a Church. The fire which possessed her had mounted to her head, and scintillated in rays about her, and there was good reason for it, for this was the first time that she had. The bishop opened his mouth wide enough to swallow a Dutch cheese. The good man was seized this morning with the pestilence. When men are big-bellied, a merciful providence, in the consideration of their works, often makes. The Cardinal of Ragusa began laughing fit to split his sides. When the door had closed upon the bishop, and he was fairly in the street, the Cardinal began laughing. He approached her to take her in his arms, and pet her after the usual fashion of card. ""Touch me not,"" said she, seeing him about to advance, ""or I will stab you with this dagger"" ""Well then, if you love me, show it"" replied she. ""I desire that you leave me instantly. If you are touched with the disease my death will not. ""I never play with blessed and sacred things,"" said Imperia. ""I'll burn the house down. Today, I hate you, good cardinal,"" said she, smiling. ""Wilt thou have a dispensation in articulo mortis? W. ""Oh, oh! I will kill you, Monseigneur,"" she said. ""Go away, you'll tire yourself."" ""I shall be pope, and you shall pay for.  Imperia was angry with her little priest for making her have a row with the Cardinal. She said she would not die till she had seen him burned alive before her eyes. She was wailing like a calf that is being slaughtered when she saw the young priest peeping at her from behind her large Venetian mirror.. ""From a little monk I would make a king, emperor, pope, and happier than either. There, thou canst put anything to fire and sword, I am thine, and thou shalt see it well"" ""Even when to redden thy"

She had a fine little daughter, concerning whom the Pope said jokingly that she should be named Theodora, as if to say The Gift Of God. She was caught by the very Net she was Accustomed to Spread for Her Love-Birds. She died at the age of 80. She is buried in the Vatican City Cemetery, in the garden of St. Peter's, in front of a large bust of the Pope.. Theodora was confined in her hotel by doctors from Padua, Pavia, and Salerno. She was preserved from all injury. Some go so far as to say that she gained therein superfineness and whiteness of skin. A famous man, of the school of Salerno, wrote a book on the subject, to show the value of a confinement for the freshness, health, preservation, and beauty of women. Theodora's body was preserved by the doctors of Padua and Pavia. She died in 1536.. Theodora was the daughter of Imperia, a courtesan and wife of Pope Pius VII. She was taken in by a cardinal, who tried to debauch her. Theodora stabbed herself with a stiletto to avoid contamination. The adventure made a great commotion in Rome, and was deplored by everyone. Imperia returned to Rome, there to weep for her poor daughter. She died in childbirth in 1231. The book was published in 1234. It is now in the collection of the Library of Congress, in Washington, D.C., and in London. The collection is entitled ""The Life of Theodoras"". She set out in the thirty-ninth year of her age, which was, according to some authors, the summer of her magnificent beauty. Sorrow made her haughty and hard with those who spoke to her of love, in order to dry her tears. The pope himself visited her in her palace, and gave her certain words of admonition. But she refused to be comforted, saying that she would henceforth devote herself to God, because she had never yet been satisfied by any man, although she had ardently desired it. Even a little priest, whom she had adored like a saint's shrine, had deceived her.. The Emperor of the Romans was much cut up about it, because he had loved her to distraction for eleven weeks. In this extremity the Pope sent for a Spanish physician, and conducted him to the beautiful creature. He proved, by various arguments, adorned with Latin and Greek quotations, that beauty is impaired by tears and tribulation, and that through sorrow's door wrinkles step in. This proposition, confirmed by the doctors of the Holy College in controversy, had the effect of opening the doors of the palace that same evening. The young cardinals, the foreign envoys, the wealthy inhabitants, and the principal men of the town of Rome came, crowded the rooms, and held a joyous festival.. Theodora's tomb was destroyed during the pillage of Rome in which the traitorous constable of Bourbon died. Theodora was placed therein in a massive coffin of gold and silver, which the cursed soldiers were anxious to obtain. The basilic cost more than the pyramid erected by the Lady Rhodepa, an Egyptian courtesan, eighteen hundred years before the coming of our divine Saviour. Never had Madame Imperia appeared so lovely as at this first gala after her mourning. Is it not abomination that now for a trifle you can have a chemise full of. The envoy of the King of France, who was a cadet of the house of l'Ile Adam, arrived late, although he had never yet seen Imperia. He was a handsome young knight, much in favour with his sovereign, in whose court he had a mistress. All the princes, cardinals, and others declared that she was worthy the homage of the whole world, which was there represented by a noble from every known land, and thus was it amply demonstrated that beauty was in every place queen of everything. The king had given certain missions to the duchy of Milan, of which he had acquitted himself so well that he was sent to Rome.. ""He was slightly built, but upright as a column, dark, with black, glistening eyes,"" writes the author. ""He had the air of an innocent child, which made him gentle and amiable as a laughing child"" ""He was a man not easily taken in; but concealing his finesse, he had the look of an amiable child,"" adds the writer. ""She was seized with such a vertigo of true love at the sight of this freshness of youth, that but for her dignity she would have kissed the good cheeks which shone like little apples"" ""She had a great deal of experience in dealing with men, and knew man to his core, because she had handled a great. The story of a young woman who fell in love with a priest begins this collection of short stories. The author describes how she suffered in her skin like a cat that is being scorched. She had an intense longing to spring upon this gentleman, and bear him in triumph to her nest, as a kite does its prey. But with great difficulty she restrained herself. She threw back her head, and assumed a most dignified attitude, as do those who have a love infatuation in their hearts. The story ends with the death of the priest, who was killed by a jealous lover. The rest of the stories are about a young girl who falls in love and loses her virginity. The stories are written in the style of the time when the author was a young lady.. The story of the French ambassador's first encounter with a courtesan is told in ""Monsieur Monsiegneur"" The story is set in L'Ile Adam, in France in the early 17th century. The young ambassador is said to have been 'as poor as a church mouse' and 'unprofitable a lover' The courtesan, however, was said to be 'gay and lively' and was 'very fond' of him. The story ends with the ambassador's death in 17th-century Paris. The author says that the story was inspired by a real-life incident involving a young man and his mistress, and that he was 'a very special man'. Madame Imperia burned within from top to toe in a horrible manner, and could not be extinguished save with the water of love. On no other occasion of her life had she had this cowardice, either for king, pope, or emperor. The high price of her favours came from the bondage in which she held her admirers. The more she humbled the more she raised herself. She lost her senses from her head to her feet, and so thoroughly that she sent a messenger to him on the galleries, begging him to pass the night with her. She was a terrible woman, but she was also a great woman.. The head chamber-women told l'Ile Adam that Madame would regale him with her most delicate inventions of love. An English cardinal, who had drained more than one big-bellied flagon, and wished to taste Imperia, whispered to him, ""Hold her fast, so that she shall never again escape us."" The story of this remark was told to the pope at his levee, and caused him to remark, /Laetamini, gentes, quoniam surrexit Dominus/. A quotation which the old cardinals abominated as a profanation of sacred texts.. L'Ile Adam relied upon the fair Imperia to reclaim the emperor, and with this idea he syringed her well with flattery. The pair remained in bed for nine days, eating, drinking, and embracing in a marvellous and most masterly manner. Madame told her women that at last she had placed her hand on a phoenix of love, since he revived from every attack. The astonishment became general throughout the country, for the pair remained together for nine more days. L'Ille Adam slipped off his garments, and tumbled into bed as if he were in his own house. He was so in love with her that she could hardly restrain herself from rolling at his feet.. Madame confessed to her servants that, differently to all other men she had had to put up with, the more she fondled this child of love, she more she desired to do so. She gave them the tail of her dress to hold, and said that if she did not tread them under foot, they would trample upon her. Nothing was talked of in Rome and Italy but the victory that had been gained over Imperia, who had boasted that she would yield to no. Imperia told the ladies of Rome that she should die it if she were deserted by this gentleman. She declared openly that she had bidden an eternal adieu her to her former gay life. She would show the whole world what virtue was by abandoning her empire for this Villiers de l'Ile Adam, whose servant she would rather be than reign of Christendom. She further declared that if such were his desire, she would let him suck her blood, eat her breasts--which were the most lovely in the world--and cut her tresses, of which she had only given a single one to the Emperor.. The English cardinal remonstrated with the pope that this love for one, in the heart of a woman who was the joy of all, was an infamous depravity. But the love of this poor woman, who had confessed the miseries of her life, was so sweet a thing, and so moved the most dissipated heart, that she silenced all clamour. One day, during Lent, Imperia made her people fast, and ordered them to go and confess, and return to God. She herself went and fell at the pope's feet, and there showed such penitence, that. Madame Imperia was married to L'Ile Adam. She had a million gold crowns. She was a great lady of pleasure. She turned her science to the root of a virtuous love. She and her young husband thought of only one thing. They left everything to marry her. They were married at a royal feast. All the Italian princes were present. They had a wonderful ceremony, at which all the Italians were present, and paid him many compliments. He fancied himself in Paradise. He left the negotiations of the King of France, left his love for Mademoiselle de Montmorency.. The pope blessed their marriage, and said that it was a fine thing to see the foolish virgin returning to God by the road of marriage. Everyone regretted the ease and freedom which had always been found in the residence of this lovely creature, who now appeared more tempting than she had ever done in her life. Much did they lament the fact that she had had the sad fantasy to become a respectable woman. To these Madame de l'Ile Adam answered jestingly, that after twenty-four years passed in the service of the public, she had a right to retire. Others said to her, that however distant the sun was, people could warm themselves in it, while she would show herself no more.. Madame Imperia gave a present to each of her friends, and large sums to the poor and suffering of Rome. She left to the convent where her daughter was to have been, and to the church she had built, which came from the cardinal of Ragusa. Several princes received this handsome couple at their courts, saying it was but right to show honour to this woman who had the courage to renounce her empire over the world of fashion, to become a virtuous woman. To these she replied that she would still have smiles to bestow upon those lords who would come and see how she played the role of a virtuous women. The English envoy answered, he believed her capable of pushing virtue to its extreme point. The couple were accompanied a long way by knights in mourning, and even by the common people, who wished them every happiness.. The Pope's birthday was celebrated with a feast at St. Peter's Cathedral in Rome. The feast was a celebration of the birth of the Pope and the anniversary of his birth. The day was marked with a special service to the Pope's family and friends. The Pope's wife, Beatrice, was given a gift of her husband's family's house. The gift was a gift from the Pope himself, a gift that was given to her by the Pope. The pope's wife was a great gift to the world, and a gift to her husband, too, as she was a daughter of the pope. The gifts were from the pope's family, but the gift was also from the people.. The Emperor of the Romans sent an envoy to his old flame, charged with Latin manuscripts. He told her that he loved her so much for herself, that he was delighted to know that she was happy, but grieved to know all her happiness was not derived from him. He said that if the king of France received her coldly, he would think it an honour to acquire a Villiers to the holy empire, and would give him such principalities as he might choose from his domains. The fair Imperia replied she was extremely obliged to the Emperor, but that had she to suffer contumely upon contumesly in France, she still intended there to finish her days.. The lady of l'Ile Adam would not go to court, but lived in the country. Her husband made a fine establishment, purchasing the manor of Beaumont-le- Vicomte. He acquired also the domain of Nointel, the forest of Carenelle, St. Martin, and other places. These said acquisitions made him the most powerful lord in the l’. The couple were so envied by all, that nothing was talked about in Paris and at Court but this marriage. He built a wonderful castle near Beaumont, which was afterwards ruined by the English. He adorned it with the furniture, foreign tapestries, chests, pictures, statues, and curiosities, of his wife, who was a great connoisseur. She was no longer proud and sharp as steel, but had the virtues and qualities of a respectable. The king came to Beauvoisis to gaze upon this wonder, and did the sire the honour to sleep at Beaumont. The modesty of the chatelaine did more than pride would have accomplished. She was invited to court, and everywhere, so imperious was her great heart. So tyrannic was her violent love for her husband, that she was never seen without a sword. She had never once forgotten God, having, as she once said, spent much of her time with churchmen, abbots, bishops, and cardinals, who had sprinkled her well with holy water, and under the curtains worked her eternal salvation. The king first, then the queen, and afterwards every individual member of the company, comple. The king gave the vacant post of lieutenant of the Ile de France and provost of Paris to his ancient ambassador, giving him the title of Viscount of Beaumont. But a wretch, jealous of this unclouded happiness, asked her, playfully, if Beaumon had ever spoken to her of his first love, Mademoiselle de Montmorency. The young lady loved l'Ile Adam so much that she remained a maiden, would listen to no proposals of marriage, and was dying of a broken heart, unable to banish her perfidious lover from her remembrance and was desirous of entering the convent of Chella.. The king, who was very partial to the viscount, also made a remark to him which stung him to the quick. Monsieur l'Ile Adam the elder was so stricken with grief at these two deaths that he expired soon after, so much did he love his two sons. By this means the manor of Beaumont, the property at Carenelle, St. St. Germain, was lost. The viscount's brother, Monsiegneur, died suddenly, and the king said, ""Monsieur, my brother has; thus our line is safe."". Madame was still fit to bear children at the age of forty-five. She believed that her barrenness was due to the fact that both she and her husband allowed pleasure to interfere with business. A physician explained to her that in a state of nature animals never failed to breed. The females employed none of those artifices, tricks, and hanky-pankies with which women accommodate the olives of Poissy. For this reason they thoroughly deserved the title of beasts, and for this reason their offspring deserved the name of beasts. She was always more lovers than spouses, and by this means engendering was prevented. She endeavoured to restrain her impetuosity, and to take things. Madame de l'Ile Adam did not conceive, and fell into a state of great melancholy. She promised him no longer to play with such a serious affair. But, alas! although she kept as quiet as that German woman who lay so still that her husband embraced her to death, and then went, poor baron, to obtain absolution from the pope, who delivered his celebrated brief. When Madame beheld a poor person's child she nearly died of grief, and it took her a whole day to recover. It was a great sorrow for her husband, who wept that he had no fruit of his great love. Soon this pair mingled their tears, for everything was common to the two in this fine household.. L'Ile Adam ordered all children to be kept out of his wife's sight. He told her that her sons might perish, like those of his poor brother. She replied, that she would not let them stir further from her petticoats than a hen allows her chickens. In fact, she had an answer for everything. She returned to the physical science of the master doctors of Paris. She sent for a celebrated Arabian physician, who had just arrived in France with a new science. She took the beasts of the fields for her preceptors, but she did not increase in size. Her flesh still remained firm and white as marble. She was the first woman to be born in France in the 6th century.. The doctors told Madame, who had come to Paris, that she was to keep on as usual, since she had had during her gay life the lovely Theodora, by the cardinal of Ragusa. The right of having children remained with women as long as their blood circulated, and all that she had to do was to multiply the chances of conception. This advice appeared to her so good that she multiplied her victories, but it was only multiplying her defeats. She obtained the flowers of love without its fruits. The poor afflicted woman wrote then to the pope, who loved her much, and told him of her sorrows. The pope wrote back to her, saying that he was sorry for her, and that he would help her to conceive.. The pope wrote a homily in which he implored her to help the child. She went to Notre Dame de Liesse with her husband. The child was born healthy, but the mother suffered from hypochondria. She died in childbirth, leaving behind a daughter and a son who died in infancy. She was buried in the church of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris. The story of the birth of the first pope was told in a book called ""The Pope's Daughter"" by Jean-Baptiste Lamarque, published in 1799.. ""Madame de l'Ile Adam is still the wicked Imperia,"" says the author. She fell into a violent passion when she saw this handsome gentleman have everything a man can desire, great wealth, royal favour, unequalled love, matchless wife, pleasure such as none other could produce, and yet fail in that which is dearest to the head of the house--namely, lineage. With this idea in her head, she wished to die, thinking how good and noble he had been to her, and how much she failed in her duty in not giving him children. She hid her sorrow in the secret recesses of her heart, and conceived a devotion worthy of her great love.. Madame Imperia was the daughter of the Sieur de Montmorency. She was married to a Sieur of Chatillon, who was a friend of her father's. The pair were engaged to be married, but the marriage fell through. The couple had a son, who died in childbirth in 1701."

This prince was for certain the most lecherous of all the royal race of Monseigneur St. Louis (who was in his life time King of France) You can laugh as loudly at those muckworms of philosophy who go about saying, ""Our fathers were better,"" as at the good, philanthropical old bunglers who pretend that mankind. The Prince was a great wit, of Alcibaidescal nature, and a chip off the old block. It was he who first conceived the idea of a relay of sweethearts, so that when he went from Paris to Bordeaux, every time he unsettled his nag he found ready for him a good meal and a bed with as much lace inside as out. Happy Prince! who died on horseback, for he was always across something in-. The Dauphin has credited a townsman with that which happened to the Lady of Cany. It is given under the title of ""La Medaille a revers"", in the collection of which it is one of the brightest jewels. But now for mine. The Duc d'Orleans had in his suite a lord of the province of Picardy, named Raoul d'Hocquetonville, who had taken for a. ""He fell into a state of melancholy, frequented no bad places, and only with regret now and then did he take a bite of his royal and dainty German morsel Isabella. He became passionate, and swore either by sorcery, by force, by trickery, or with her consent, to enjoy the flavours of this gentle lady"" ""My lord, I do not desire to trouble myself with the love of other persons, not that I despise the joys which are therein. The artful fellow ceased to mention his desires, but had a post of honour given to the Lady of Hocquetonville, in the queen's household. And gets killed in various different ways, but generally is overridden. For, my lord, if the days of our old age are more numerous than those of our youth, of them must we think.. The Countess d'Hocquetonville believed that she was desired by Madame Isabella for some service appertaining to her post, or invited to some sudden amusement. No one had been able to inform the noble dame of the princess's departure, so she hastened to the splendid chamber, which, in the Hotel St. Paul, led into the queen's bed. ""You will possess me--but dead! Ha! my lord, do not force me to a struggle which must become known to certain people"" ""I may yet retire, and the Sire d'Hocquetonville shall be ignorant of the sorrow with which you have forever tinged my life"" ""The Sire would let himself be hacked to pieces in your service"". ""As an honest woman, whatever happens to me, good or evil, I shall keep no secret,"" said the woman. ""When you pass that line,"" cried she, pointing to a board, ""I will kill myself"" ""My lord, without being in the least terrified, took a chair, placed it at the very edge of the plank in question, and commenced a glowing description of certain things,"" she said.. The lewd fellow, perceiving that the lady did not stop her ears, commenced to describe to her, after the fashion of arabesque pictures, the wanton inventions of debauchery. Then did his eyes shoot flame, his words burn, and his voice ring, and he himself took great pleasure in calling to mind the various ways of his ladies. But she, ashamed to be found buried in thought, gazed proudly at the. ""I will wager,"" said the duke, smiling, ""that, nevertheless, for the future you spur the Sire d'Hocquetonville to a little sharper pace"" ""Oh no! I can free myself,"" replied she, brandishing the stiletto. ""Are not those of verse is yours?"". ""I have a means of plunging you into the sloughs of three brazen hussies, as you call them,"" he said. ""Never, while I live,"" he replied. ""You. ""Raoul is jealous,"" said he.

""Come! Come! to your places my good friends. I was becoming very weary. I wished to arrange with you a merry feast after the ancient method"" Then came the merry blades in great haste, and found a good and substantial supper smiling at them from the silver plates upon the table, and the table well arranged and well lighted, loaded with fine silver cups.. ""Ah! my dear master, you are a prince, and can do as you please,"" she said. ""I have a sweet wife, to whom I owe my company, and an account of all my deeds and actions"" ""You are,"" said the duke, ""a man whom I love, and consider. Sire d'Hocquetonville sat down to a table in order to please his prince as far as he could lawfully do so. Then they all commenced to laugh, joke, and talk about the ladies. According to their custom, they related to each other their good fortunes and their love adventures. They spared no woman except the queen of the house.. ""The Sire d'Hocquetonville unharnessed himself little by little from the reluctance. In spite of his virtues, he indulged certain desires, and became soaked in these impurities like a saint who defiles himself while saying his prayers. The duke, gay as a universal legate.

""But,"" said Raoul, ""in things which should be so much alike, how is it that there is so great a difference?"" ""Ha! Ha! Ha!"" replied the duke. ""What man would not forfeit a third of his future happiness? and he who has known her once would for a second night forfeit without regret eternity"" ""Ha!"" said the Duke, ""Ha, Ha!Ha!"". The Duke pushed Raoul, who let himself be pushed willingly, into the room. By this means the prince compelled the lady to deliberate by which dagger she would live or die. At midnight the Sire d'Hocquetonville came out gleefully, not without remorse at having been false to his good wife.. Berthe de BOURGONGE was the wife of a French lord. Her husband engraved an epitaph on her marble tomb in Peronne. The epitaph was written in elegant Latin, but for the convenience of all it was.

He would kill him over again if the. The story of the death of the lady of Hocquetonville was published in 18th century France.

He was already considerably enamoured of little Savoisy, son of the chamberlain to his majesty King Charles the Sixth.. The Queen Isabella's love for Savoisy was so strong that she was drawn to him. The two were so in love that they were able to decipher the hieroglyphic. The Queen's love was so great that she wanted to make sure that Savoisi's horses were stabled at the house of her cousin. The pair were soon in bed together, and began to play with each other's bodies.. The queen feared in advance some unfortunate adventure for Bonne. The constable was as ready to brandish his broadsword as a priest to bestow benedictions. The queen, as sharp as a dirk, said one day, while coming out from vespers, to her cousin, who was. ""Love likes blood, Madame"" - the Queen considered a good reply, and put it into writing, and later on, into action, when her lord the king wounded one of her lovers. ""You know by constant experience, that in the early time of love each of two lovers is always in great fear of exposing the mystery of the heart,"" she wrote. ""When one is full of days, he should not make a wry face at death, and the sword of a husband is a pleasant death for a gallant,"" she added.

""Pierce me through!"" replied the girl; ""you will learn nothing"" ""If thy tongue gets entangled, if thou falterest, I will pierce thee with my dagger!"" ""Go upstairs; I've corrected Billette rather severely,"" said the constable. ""I've corrected her rather severely."". The mother opened her eyes pretty widely, you may imagine--at the cries of her little one. She was greatly terrified at seeing him in the hands of her husband, who had his right hand all bloody, and cast a fierce glance on the mother and son. ""Madame,"" asked the man of quick execution, ""this child, is he the fruit of my loins, or those of Savois. ""Kill me if you will, but touch me not,"" she cried. ""You shall live,"" replied the husband, ""because I reserve you for a chastisement more ample then death"" ""You have given me a lieutenant."" ""Indeed!"" ""Who is he?"" ""It is not Savoisy, and I will never say the name of a man that I don't know"". The king was so enraged that he took his dog and strangled him. He then went to his servants and asked them to tell him what had happened. The servants told him that the king had killed his dog. The king was enraged and killed the dog. He also killed the servant who had taken the dog to the king's house. The King then went and killed himself. The story of the death of the dog is told in the book of Acts of the Family.

The design of these has for a long time been shown at the house of Cardinal Duprat, the king's Chancellor. The constable ransacked his brains, and at the bottom, from his finest stratagems, drew the best, and fitted it so well to the present case, that the gallant would be certain to be taken.. The lord's most loyal and adroit archers were placed on the quay tower. The retainers, even the chaplain, were ordered not to leave the house under pain of death. The guard of the two sides of the hotel having been committed to the soldiers of a company of ordnance, who were ordered to keep a sharp lookout in the side streets.

She went to the full-dress Mass, where no dresses were seen without armorial bearings. She was accompanied by her pages, the two ensigns and men-at-arms.

Among the band of gallant knights who frisked round the ladies in church, the countess had more than one whose joy she was, and who had given his heart to her. This one remained bashful, always stuck against the same pillar, never moving from it, but readily ravished with the sight alone of this lady whom he had chosen as his. His pale face was softly melancholy. His physiognomy gave proof of fine heart, one of those which nourish ardent passions and plunge delightedly into the despairs of love without hope.

The Count then said: 'I will let you live, and I will not kill. The countess knelt down in her accustomed place, and again regarding her faithful slave, found his face thinner and more deeply lined than ever it had been. Then she turned away her eyes, and wished to go to the queen and request her assistance in this desperate case, for she took pity on her lover. But one of the captains said to her, with great appearance of respect, ""Madame, we have orders not to allow you to speak with man or woman, even though it should be the queen or your confessor. And remember that the lives of all of us are at stake."". Madame recognised with a pleasure, always fresh in the minds of women, the omnipotence of her magnificent regard by the answer which, without saying a word, the chevalier made to it. This idea so touched her, that from three repetitions between her orisons she was tickled with the desire to put into a lump all the joys of man, and to dissolve them for him in one single glance of love. After having heated her slave more than thirty times, she was confirmed in her belief that he would bravely die for her. Who does not love the warm attack of life when it flows thus round the heart and engulfs everything?. When the officiating priest turned round to sing the Off you go to this fine gilded flock, the constable's wife went out by the side of the pillar where her courtier was. She passed in front of him and endeavoured to insinuate into his understanding by a speaking glance that he was to follow her. She saw that he had moved a little from his place, and dared not advance, so modest was he. But upon this last sign, the gentleman, sure of not being over-credulous, mixed with the crowd with little and noiseless steps, like an innocent who is afraid of venturing into one of those good places people call bad. The countess practiced so well the profession of the daughters of pleasure when they work to bring grist into their mills, that one would have said nothing resembled a harlot so much as a woman of high birth. At this wretched hour, Madame d'Armagnac was ashamed of having done all these harlotries to the profit of death, and of betraying Savoisy the better to save him. But this slight remorse was lame as the greater, and came tardily.. The countess leaned heavily upon her vassal's arm, and said to him -- ""Come quickly to my room; it is necessary that I should speak with you"" Then she honoured this courtier with a profound salutation, in which was depicted the ironical respect due to those who have the great courage to die for so little. ""Bah! Madame: why tell him? Send him away well contented by the postern,"" said the constable's lady. ""I have not the courage to confess to him the reward with which I am about. ""Come along,"" cried the countess, ""I will confess all to him. That will be the punishment for my sins"" ""So many men die in war for nothing, cannot this one die for something? I'll produce another like him if that will console you."" ""I have acted vilely towards you. On your departure from this house, you will meet your death"" ""I am a man of the people. I am not of the world. I will not lie to you. I have not lied to you"" ""You are not a man. You are a woman. You have not been lied to. You will not be lied to."". ""Ah!"" Replied Boys-Bourredon, interring in the depths of his heart a dark despair. ""I am grateful to you for having made use of me as of something which belonged to you"" ""Ah! were it not for Savoisy, how I would love thee!"" said she. ""My horoscope predicted that I should die by the love of a great lady"" ""Alas! my fate is then accomplished,"" replied Boys-bourred on. ""Take, then, my life!"" ""I love you so much that every day you I have dreamed of offering you in imitation of. The constable's wife was pierced to the heart. Savoisy had come at the appointed hour, and like all the lovers, thinking only of his lady, he had not seen the count's spies and had slipped in at the postern. This collision of lovers was the cause of the constable’s cutting short the words of those who came from the Rue St. Germain. ""I will sell my life dearly, but I shall die content in thinking that my decease ensures the happiness of her I love,"" he said. ""You have killed an innocent man,"" replied the countess, without changing colour. ""Behold, Madame,"" said he, ""a picture which will enlight. ""I was dreaming of the king,"" said she. ""Savioury was not my lover"" ""Then, my dear, why not have told me so?"" asked the constable. ""I don't know,"" she said, curtly, ""if you will have the goodness to believe what I have said to you"" ""I was afraid of having made a mistake,"" said the husband. ""But how came Savoisy with the key of the postern?"" ""I have no idea,"" she replied.. Boys-Bourredon was a man whom danger had well recommended to the ladies. Savoisy was sorely lamented by his lady, who had done all that a woman could do to save her lover. Later he was more than wept, he was regretted. The countess having related this adventure to Queen Isabella, her majesty seduced Boys-B Bourredon from the service of her cousin and put him to her own. The queen was so touched with the qualities and firm courage of this gentleman.. Boys-Bourredon was in a moment sewn in a sack and thrown into the Seine, near the ferry at Charenton, as everyone knows. The queen utilised so well the two deaths he had caused and threw them so often in his face, that she made him as soft as a cat's paw and put him in the straight road of marriage. He proclaimed her a modest and virtuous constable's lady, as indeed she was. He was so proud of his fortune, that having. ""The God of Love never abandons them, especially when they are beautiful, young, and of good family,"" says the author. ""After a good woman the most precious thing is, certes, a pretty gentleman,"" he adds. ""Women need never lose their heads in serious cases, because the God of love never abandon them,"" he says.

0.71,0.8099999999999999,59.16860097066892,"The French Revolution was sparked by the assassination of Napoleon III in 1789. The plot involved the murder of a goldsmith's daughter. The goldsmith had been offered a marriage by a man with the features of an ape. He refused to give his daughter up for a man who had scarcely a tooth in his jaws. The French revolution was triggered by the death of the goldsmith, who was killed in 1791. The assassination of the French president, Napoleon III, took place in 1799. The murder of Napoleon's daughter, who had been given a marriage to a gold-smith, was staged by a parliamentary advocate. The marriage was arranged by the gold-mith's daughter's father, who refused to hand over his daughter for a marriage.. ""I would rather offer myself to the passers-by than to you,"" said the girl. ""I promise you a disloyalty that will only finish with death--yours or mine."" ""I give him to you for a husband. You must get on as well as you can together,"" said her father. ""Well then, before I obey your orders I'll let him know what he may expect,"" she said. ""You will make a bad bargain, seeing that I would rather Offer myself to passers- by than toYou"" ""I will give you my love, and you will give me my love,"" she replied.. The good advocate took this strange behaviour for one of those artifices by which the women seek to fan the flames of love and turn the devotion of their admirers into the more tender caress. So that the knave took little notice of it, but laughing at the complaints of the charming creature, asked her to fix the day. ""To-morrow,"" replied she, ""for the sooner this odious marriage takes place, the sooner I shall be free to have gallants and to lead the gay life of those who love where it pleases them"". The story of a young king and a goldsmith's daughter is told in the classic novel, The Thief's Daughter. The story is about a young man and his quest to buy the most precious jewel in the shop. The king's daughter refused a thousand crowns from this one, snubbed that one, would yield to no one, but turned up her nose at the finest young men of the city, gentlemen.. The king not taking a fancy to the jewels, or they not being to his taste, the good man looked in a secret drawer for a big white diamond. ""Ah!, sire!"" replied the maid, ""I shall be married to-morrow, but if you will lend me the dagger that is in your belt, I will defend my honour, and you shall take it"" ""Immediately the king gave her the little dagger, and her brave reply rendered him so amorous that he lost his appetite,"" says the author. ""The whole kingdom of France could never pay"" says the king's daughter. ""If you were to give me all the little rings in the place to choose. The author describes a man in a hurry to get married. He had an apartment prepared, intending to lodge his new lady-love in one of his palaces. But when he arrived at the nuptial chamber, he found his bride was a fury, not a lovely bride but a wild she-devil. He describes how she refused her share of the couch, and sat defiantly before the fire warming her ire and her calves.. ""What would you with me?"" she cried, drawing the king's dagger. ""Everything,"" answered he. ""Ha! I should be a great fool to give myself against my inclination!"" ""If you fancied you would find my virtue unarmed you made a great error,"" she said. ""I should be an idiot to give my virtue to you,"" he replied. ""You would be a fool to think I would give it to you unarmed"" ""I would be an fool to believe that you would be so foolish,"" she replied, ""and I would be even more foolish to think you would think that I would find you unarmed."" ""I am a fool,"" he said, ""but I am not a fool. I am a good man."". ""Behold the poniard of the king, with which I will kill you if you make the semblance of a step towards me"" ""These are the confines of theKing's domain. Beware how you pass them."" ""Death seemed sweet to him if he could only taste of them a little"" ""I will kill if you take a step toward me"""" ""Beware how you passed them"" ""You will be killed if you step out of the circle"". The advocate rushed within the domain of the king, saying, ""I mind not death"" He came with such force that his charmer fell backwards onto the bed. But the young beauty defended herself so gallantly that the advocate enjoyed no further advantage than a knock at the door that would not admit him. The young beauty, whose head was full of the King, was not even touched by this great love. She said gravely, ""If you menace me further, it is not you but myself I will kill."" She glared at him so savagely that the poor man was quite terrified, and commenced to deplore the evil hour in which he had taken her to wife. The night which should have been so joyous was passed in tears, lamentations, prayers, and ejaculations.. ""I have not deceived you,"" said she. ""Agreeable to my promise, I shall give myself to the king, making you a present of the peddler, chance passers, and street loungers with whom I threatened you."" When the day broke she put on her wedding garments and waited patiently till the poor husband had to depart to his office client's business, and then ran out into the town to seek the king. ""I am the daughter of the king,"" she said, ""and I am the wife of the lord of the town."". The king's servant stopped her as she left the house. He told her what sort of a man the king was. She was told she would luxuriously lodged and well kept, but that she must keep the king well in hand. The poor husband shed scalding tears, when he found his little bird had flown, and became melancholy and pensive. He died soon after. The king's daughter was married to the king's son-in-law, who died soon afterwards. The queen's daughter had a daughter with the king, who later died.. The story of Saint Jacques and his wife is told in the play, The Marriage Plot. The play is based on the story of a man who left his wife for a woman who refused a consummation. The man, still thinking of her, neglected his cases and his clients, his robberies and everything. But he left her to the king, determining one day to have her to himself, and thinking that a life-long shame would not be too dear a payment for a night with her. He was later found dead in his bed, and the story is retold in a new version of the play.. The story of the love of a woman and the death of her lover is told in the novel ""The Death of the King"" by Jean-Baptiste de L'Aude. The author says the woman's lover, who died in a car crash, was a man who was unable to bear to be with her. He was so overcome with grief that he committed suicide. The story is told of a man's love for a woman who died of a heart attack. The woman's death is said to have been caused by the man's inability to bear the loss of his lover, and to have caused him to kill himself. The man's death was blamed on his love for the woman, and he died in pain.. 'Twas thus she commenced to build up that great fortune which made her a person of consideration in the town. By this means she prevented many gallant gentlemen from perishing, playing her game so well, and inventing such fine stories' 'His Majesty little guessed how much she aided him in securing the happiness of his subjects' 'She has such a hold over him that she could have made him believe the floor was the ceiling' 'He wore himself out first, poor man, seeing that he eventually died from excess of love'. The king, although vexed could not repress a smile, and kept her on a month to silence scandal. And last, la demoiselle de Pisseleu, anxious to obtain her place, brought about her ruin. Many would have liked to be ruined in the same way, seeing she was taken by a young lord, was happy with him, the fires of love in her being still unquenched. But to take up the thread again, I would like to ask you to help me understand the story of the French queen, who was the daughter of the King of France.. The king's sweetheart was passing through the town in her litter to buy laces, furs, velvets, broideries, and other ammunition, and so charmingly attired, and looking so lovely, that anyone, especially the clerks, would have believed the heavens were open above them. She, at that time lazily swinging her charming little foot over the side of the litter, drew in her head as though she had seen an adder. She was a good wife, for I know some who would have proudly passed their husbands, to their shame and to the great disrespect of conj. The Sire de Lannoy was so infatuated with his wife that he tried to stop her from leaving. The good husband instead of killing her bravely, shed scalding tears at that laugh. The aspect of this weak flower, which had been his in the bud, but far from him had spread its lovely leaves. The fairy figure, the voluptuous bust--all this made the poor advocate more wretched and more mad for her than it is possible to express in words. You must have been madly in love with a woman who refuses your advances thoroughly to understand the agony of this unhappy man.. A man of good renown, who had his audiences with the king, came one morning to the advocate, saying that he required immediately a large sum of money. He swore that life, fortune, honour--all might go, but that for once at least he would be flesh-to-flesh with her. He passed the night saying, ""oh yes; ah! I'll have her!"" and ""Curses am I not her husband?"" and ""Devil take me,"" striking himself on the forehead and tossing about. The next day, even the day after that terrible one which had been so sore a trial to him, he. ""Is it true, my lord, the you have a hungry and relentless creditor?"" said he. To which the artful fellow replied, 12,000 crowns were not so often met at the corner of a street. As he had only lately returned from the wars, he did not know that the lovely woman adored by the king had a husband. ""I have a fever,"" replied the knave. ""Don't breathe a syllable,"" said the courtier. ""This evening, in consideration of 20,000 Crowns and my domain of Brie, I shall take her measure"". The lord asked his servant to bring the ducats to him. The servant came faithfully to the rendezvous with the advocate, who had begged the lord to bring her. There they lay all in a row, like nuns going to vespers. The lord said: ""It will be a good trick to make her sign the receipt"" The servant said: ""She's sharper than mustard, and these nights stolen from the king have lined her pockets well"" The lord replied:  ""Nothing can be done; of the 12,000 crowns you shall not have a brass farthing"". ""I have never been so well paid,"" said the handmaiden. ""My dear,"" replied the dear man, ""you shall have them without being troubled with me"" ""Your client has not told you who I am, eh? No? Learn then, I am the husband of the lady whom the king has debauched, and whom you serve,"" he said. ""Carry her these crowns, and come back here,"" he added. ""I haveNever been soWell paid."". ""Now, my little one,"" said he, ""here are 12,000 crowns. With this sum I could buy lands, men, women, and the conscience of three priests at least. I believe if I give it to you I can have you, body, soul, and toe nails"" ""But how?"" said she. ""By telling him that the king is coming to supper with her, and that to-night he must seek his little amusements elsewhere. By so doing I shall be able to take his place and the king's"" ""I have bought you, you and your tricks. You won't have to look at these crowns twice without finding me a way to have my wife"". ""By my faith, come,"" said she; ""after supper the lights will be put out, and you can enjoy Madame if you remain silent"" ""Oh,"" cried the advocate, ""look, take the 12,000 crowns, and I promise you twice as much more if I get by fraud that which belongs to me by right"" ""In bringing this conjunction about you commit no sin,"" said the priest. ""It is a work of piety to bring together two people whose hands only been put one in to the other, and that by the priest"" ""I am going to that place where everything goes--save our lives, which come from it"". The French king's advocate tried to disguise his ugly face and smelt of the musty lawyer. He dressed himself in his thinnest clothes and sallied forth, quickly gaining the Rue d'Hirundelle. But just as he was beginning to think he had been made a fool of, the maid came down and opened alike the door to him and good husband slipped gleefully into the king's apartment. But our crafty fellow fancied himself the nicest man in the world, although in spite of his drugs and perfumes he was really the nastiest. He was not so clever as the pretty washerwoman of Portillon who one day wishing to appear at her best before one of her lovers, got rid of a disagreeable odour in a manner.. The girl locked him carefully in a cupboard that was close to his wife's bed. Through a crack he feasted his eyes upon her beauty. She undressed herself before the fire, and put on a thin nightgown. ""Am I not worth 20,000 crowns to-night? Is that overpaid with a castle in Brie?"" she asked. ""My shoulders alone are worth a kingdom,"" he replied.. Madame said to her maid, ""I should like to see you in my place"" Then the maid laughed, saying, ""Be quiet, Madame, he is there"" Madame said, ""Oh well, he shall have his money's worth. I'll give his desires time to cool"" The maid then told her the whole story, wishing to keep her favour and the 12,000 crowns.. The chambermaid told her husband that he must take himself off early in the morning in order that I may not find out your trick upon me. The advocate, released from his cold hiding-place, rolled rapturously into the warm sheets, thinking to himself, ""Oh! this is good!"" To tell the truth, the maid gave him his money's worth--and the good man thought of the difference between the profusion of the royal houses and the niggardly ways of the citizens' wives. The maid cried softly in the curtains to the king's sweetheart, that his lordship was there, and jumped into bed, while her mistress went out as if she had been the chambermaid.. The servant played her part marvellously well, regaling the knave with gentle cries, shiverings, convulsions and tossings about. Towards the morning, when the cock crew, the wife slipped in beside her husband, and pretended to sleep. But before finishing, the lover who wished to preserve a souvenir of this sweet night of love, by a dextrous turn, plucked out one of his wife's hairs, where from I know not, seeing I was not there.. The good man grieved to lose his treasure, and wished to see the source of his vanished happiness. Then the maid tapped gently on the happy man's forehead, whispering in his ear, ""It is time, get into your clothes and off you go--it's daylight"" This became known. The poor advocate, named Feron, died of shame, seeing that he was the only one who had not his own wife while she, who was from this was called La Belle Feroniere, married, after leaving the king, a young lord, Count of Buzancois.. This teaches us not to attach ourselves more than we can help to wives who refuse to support our yoke. And in her old days she"
0.9,1.0,67.78523489932886,"The lord of Valennes, a pleasant place, of which the castle is not far from the town of Thilouse, had taken a mean wife. She allowed her good husband to abstain from those pleasures stipulated for in all contracts of marriage. But nature, which the crooked, the bandy-legged, the blind, and the ugly abuse so unmercifully here below, and have no more esteem for her than the well-favoured,--gives the same appetite to all and to all the same mouth for pudding. The lord was always hunting wild animals and not the more entertaining than is a room full of smoke. And what is more, the said sportsman was all sixty years of age, on which subject, however, he was a silent as a hempen widow on the subject. The lord of Valennes searched everywhere for nice little pots to cover, and often in addition to wild, he hunted tame animals. At length however by reason of much ferreting about and much enquiry, it happened that in Thilouse was the widow of a weaver who had a real treasure in the person of a little damsel of sixteen years. She had her to sleep with her in her own bed, watched over her, got her up in the morning, and put her to such a work that between the twain they gained about eight pennies a day. The widow of the weaver had never allowed her to leave her apronstrings, and whom, with great maternal forethought, she always accompanied when the calls of nature demanded her obedience. The Widow of the Weaver had her in bed with her, watched her, and got her out in the. The widow and her daughter had only bread enough to save them from dying of hunger. They often wanted wood in winter and clothes in summer, owing enough rent to frighten sergeants of justice. While the daughter was increasing in beauty, the mother was increase in poverty, and ran into debt on account of her daughter's virginity. The lord of Valennes by a mere chance came into the hovel of the two spinners, and in order to dry himself sent for some fagots to Plessis, close by. While waiting for them, he sat on a stool between the two poor women, and while waiting for the two women, he said to them: 'I have a proposition for you, and you can't refuse it.' The widow replied: 'If you want to know what it is, you can ask me.' The lord then said: 'What is it?'. The good old lord twisted about upon his stool, eyeing the maid and stretching his neck like a monkey trying to catch nuts. The mother noticed, but said not a word, being in fear of the lord to whom the whole of the country belonged. Had any one said to her, ""Come, let us make love,"" she would have said, ""Love! What is that?"" she was so innocent and so little open to the comprehensions of the thing. The maid was a young woman, with eyes of a modest and virtuous blue, with a look more coy than that of the Virgin, for she was less forward, never having had a child. She was all fresh and clean and pretty, like the first frost, green and tender as an April bud; in fact, she resembled all that is prettiest in the world. The good old Lord twisted about on his stool and eyed the maid. ""By the blood of Christ and the charms of your daughter am I not a gentleman? Is not my word good enough?"" ""Ah! well I don't say that it is not; but as true as I am a poor spinner I love my child too much to leave her"" ""By the thousand million saints who are in heaven, I swear that--"" ""I should like those fagots to pass through the hands of the notary. ""There! There!"" said the lord, ""go and find the notary"" ""My child is quite reasonable,"" said the woman. ""That which is dearest to you is your honour,"" said she. ""Everyone, without counting my lord, will try to rob you of it, but you see well what it is worth,"" she said. ""Now you are no longer answerable to God for the virtue of your child,"" he replied. ""You see what it's worth?"" she asked. ""Yes,"" said he. ""And that which is most dear to you, do not lose it save willingly and in proper manner"" ""You are not answerable,"" she replied.. ""Take heed that your chance of marriage be not damaged beforehand, otherwise you will go to the bad,"" said the mother of Thilouse. ""Nothing is more profitable than virtue,"" replied the mother, ""but the business was as risky as that of rearing silkworms"" "" innocence is like a medlar, and ripens quickly on the straw,"" said her mother. ""It is as dangerous as rearing a silkworm, which is liable to perish"" said the father. ""The good housewives endeavoured to nourish and bring up their daughters virtuous, but the business of reared silkworms, which are liable to die, is a dangerous business,"" he said. Marie Fiquet followed the wise counsel of her mother, and would take no notice of the soft requests, honied words, or apish tricks of her master. When the old lord tried to kiss her, she would put her back up like a cat at the approach of a dog, crying out ""I will tell Madame!"" In short at the end of six months he had not even recovered the price of a single fagot. From her labour Marie Fiquett became harder and firmer. She became a hard and firm woman. She would not have been a virgin if she had not been promised marriage. She was not a virgin, but she was a woman.. The good old man took these village sayings for flowers of innocence, and ceased not to make little signs to her, long harangues and a hundred vows and sermons. He became enamoured of her with an old man's passion, which augments in geometrical proportions as opposed to the passions of young men. The old men love with their weakness which grows greater, and the young with their strength which grows less. ""If I were as full of holes as a sieve not one should be for you, so ugly do I think you,"" she would say to her master. ""When you have taken it from me will you give it me back again?"" she would ask him. ""I am a good girl,"" he replied.. Marie Fiquet was the very girl to suit her pursuer. The old steward, who had gained three hundred pounds by different services about the house, desired to live quietly without opening the front door again. But his good master begged him to marry to please him, assuring him that he need not trouble about his wife. So the good steward wandered out of sheer good nature into this marriage. The day of the wedding, bereft of all her reasons, and not able to find objections to her pursuers, she made him give her a fat settlement and dowry as the price of her conquest. She then gave the old knave leave to wink at her as often as he could, promising him as many embraces as he had given grains of wheat to her mother, and then gave him a kiss.. The story of a young man who fell in love with a maid is told in a novel by William Makepeace Thackeray. The author describes the moment he first met the maid, who was 'the sweetest girl in the world' The author says he was unable to resist the temptation to eat her up. But he says he knew nothing of the 'sweet business of love' when he ate her. The novel is set in Thierry's home town of Thilouse in the south of France. The book is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99, and is available in English and French. For more information, visit www.hodderandstoughton.co.uk.. ""Fricquenelle"" is said of a girl I do not wish you to find in your arms on your wedding night, unless you have been brought up in the philosophy of Zeno. Marie Fiquet became famous, and it is still said in our country, ""She is a maid of Thilouse,"" in mockery of a bride, and to signify a ""fricquanelle"" ""Fric quenelle,"" is said to be a good maid, and there are always good maids to be found in Touraine, and elsewhere. ""Fiquet"" is a French word for a good girl. The word is derived from the French word ""fiquet,"" which. The Cent Contes Drolatiques are made more to teach the moral of pleasure than to procure the pleasure of pointing a moral. God wishes to punish the lord of Valennes, for trying to purchase a jewel made to be given, says the author. The story is told in the form of a short tale, with the author adding his own commentary. The tale is told by the narrator, who is called the 'King of the Drolats'"
